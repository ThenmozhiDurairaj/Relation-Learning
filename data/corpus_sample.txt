 Pesticide residue refers to the pesticides that may remain on or in food after they are applied to food crops.
The levels of these residues in foods is often stipulated by regulatory bodies in many countries.
 Exposure of the general population to these residues most commonly occurs through consumption of treated food sources, or being in close contact to areas treated with pesticides such as farms or lawns around houses.
 Many of these chemical residues, especially derivatives of chlorinated pesticides, exhibit bioaccumulation which could build up to harmful levels in the body as well as in the environment.
 Persistent chemicals can be magnified through the food chain, and have been detected in products ranging from meat, poultry, and fish, to vegetable oils, nuts, and various fruits and vegetables.
   Pesticide residue by country This section requires expansion.
  Pesticides in the European Union Union
 In September 2008, the European Union issued new and revised Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for the roughly 1,100 pesticides ever used in the world.
 The revision was intended to simplify the previous system, under which certain pesticide residues were regulated by the Commission, others were regulated by Member States, and others were not regulated at all.
   Pesticide residues in New Zealand Zealand
 Food Standards Australia New Zealand develops the standards for levels of pesticide residues in foods through a consultation process.
 The New Zealand Food Safety Authority publishes the maximum limits of pesticide residues for foods produced in New Zealand.
  United KingdomMonitoring of pesticide residues in the UK began in the 1950s.
 From 1977 to 2000 the work was carried out by the Working Party on Pesticide Residues (WPPR), until in 2000 the work was taken over by the Pesticide Residue Committee (PRC).
 The PRC advise the government through the Pesticides Safety Directorate and the Food Standards Agency (FSA).
  United StatesIn the US, tolerances for the amount of pesticide residue that may remain on food are set by the EPA, and measures are taken to keep pesticide residues below the tolerances.
 The US EPA has a web page for the allowable tolerances.
 In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and USDA also routinely check food for the actual levels of pesticide residues.
  Health ImpactsMany pesticides achieve their intended use of killing pests, by disrupting the nervous system.
 Due to similarities in brain biochemistry among many different organisms, there is much speculation that these chemicals can have a negative impact on humans as well.
 There are also studies that show positive correlations between exposure to pesticides through occupational hazard, which tends to be significantly higher than that ingested by the general population through food, and the occurrence of certain cancers.
 Even though the majority of the general population may not come in direct contact with large quantities of pesticides, many of the pesticide residues that are ingested tend to be lipophilic and can bioaccumulate in the body.
 Concerns have been raised about the possible role of continuous low-dosage exposure in causing certain cancers.
 On the other hand, pesticide use has proven to be a valuable tool in combatting disease vectors that spread illness to millions of children and adults each year.
 They are used in many developing countries to prevent the spread of malaria, leishmaniasis, dengue, and Japanese encephalitis which have an enormous economical burden on society.
  Child neurodevelopmentChildren are thought to be especially vulnerable to exposure to pesticide residues, especially if exposure occurs at critical windows of development.
 Due to the greater intake of food relative to bodyweight in children, bioaccumulation effects can prove to be especially harmful.
Neurotoxins, and other chemicals that originate from pesticides pose the biggest threat to the developing human brain and nervous system.
 Since precise spacial and temporal information must be communicated between cells for the proper development of the human CNS, disruptions in the form of miscommunication or damage to neurons can result in permanent and irreversible damages.
 Presence of pesticide metabolites in urine samples have been implicated in disorders such as:
 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, behavioral and emotional problems, and delays in development.
 There is a lack of evidence of a direct cause and effect relationship between long-term, low-dose exposure to pesticide residues and neurological disease, partly because manufacturers are not always legally required to examine potential long-term threats.
  Residues on food "Dirty dozen" and "clean fifteen"According to the Environmental Working Group choosing to buy certain organic food can significantly lower residue exposure by as much as about 90%.
 The group came up with a list of fruits and vegetable that are recommended to avoid as they are known to contain high levels of pesticide residues.
 These foods, referred to as the "Dirty Dozen" readily absorb pesticides and retain them, so even if washed, they will still have noticeable levels of residues.
 The ability of a fruit or vegetable to retain or repel pesticides is dependent on its outer shell or protectie layer.
 Fruits such as strawberries are more likely to absorb and retain pesticides than pineapples are.
  Organic food vs CommercialEven though some organic foods contain significantly less amounts of pesticides than commercially produced products, they still contain certain amounts of residue levels that are persistent in the environment.
 The methods of organic farming prohibit the use of pesticides, however certain chemicals could be persistent in the soil, reach the organic produce via pesticide drift from nearby farms, or contaminate produce during transportation to the consumer.
 It was found that produce grown using organic methods had one third the amount of pesticide residue that was available in commercially produced food.
 Also, in comparison to food that was grown using Integrated pest management techniques, organic produce showed about 50% less residue.
 Organic produce has also been shown to generally have a greater level of iron, magnesium, vitamin C, phosphorous, and antioxidant phytochemicals.
   Minimizing exposure to pesticide residuesIn addition to choosing to buy organic produce, there are certain measures that can be taken to minimize exposure to harmful residues:
 certain washes are available that remove chemical residues, peeling fruits and vegetables that have known high levels of pesticide residues, and growing your own essential produce.
 Pesticides are substances or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling or mitigating any pest. 
A pesticide may be a chemical unicycle, biological agent (such as a virus or bacterium), antimicrobial, disinfectant or device used against any pest.
 Pests include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, molluscs, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, spread disease or arevector for disease or cause nuisance.
 Although there are benefits to the use of pesticides, some also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other animals.
 According to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, 9 of the 12 most dangerous and persistent organic chemicals are pesticides.
 Pesticides are categorized into four main substituent chemicals:
 herbicides; fungicides; insecticides and bactericides.
 DefinitionFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has defined the term of pesticide as:
  The term includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit.
 Also used as substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.
 Type of Pesticide Target Pest Group Group
 Subclasses of pesticides include herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, pediculicides, and biocides.
 Pesticides can be classified by target organism, chemical structure, and physical state.
Pesticides can also be classed as inorganic, synthetic, or biologicals (biopesticides), although the distinction can sometimes blur.
 Biopesticides include microbial pesticides and biochemical pesticides.
 Plant-derived pesticides, or "botanicals", have been developing quickly.
 These include the pyrethroids, rotenoids, nicotinoids, and a fourth group that includes strychnine and scilliroside.
 Many pesticides can be grouped into chemical families.
 Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates.
 Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g.
 DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, and other related compounds.
 They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously.
 Their toxicities vary greatly, but they have been phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate.
 Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines.
 Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis.
 Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates, and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates.
 Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates.
 Prominent families of herbicides include pheoxy and benzoic acid herbicides 
  Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broadleaved weeds rather than grasses.
 The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plants nutrient transport system.
 Triazines interfere with photsynthesis.[8]:335 Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.
 Pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method.
 Most pesticides work by poisoning pests.[9] A systemic pesticide moves inside a plant following absorption by the plant.
 With insecticides and most fungicides, this movement is usually upward (through the xylem) and outward.
 Increased efficiency may be a result.
 Systemic insecticides, which poison pollen and nectar in the flowers, may kill bees and other needed pollinators.
 In 2009, the development of a new class of fungicides called paldoxins was announced.
 These work by taking advantage of natural defense chemicals released by plants called phytoalexins, which fungi then detoxify using enzymes.
 The paldoxins inhibit the fungi's detoxification enzymes.
 They are believed to be safer and greener.
  UsesPesticides are used to control organisms that are considered to be harfull.
 For example, they are used to kill mosquitoes that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like west nile virus, yellow fever, and malaria.
 They can also kill bees, wasps or ants that can cause allergic reactions.
 Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by parasites such as fleas.
Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by moldy food or diseased produce.
 Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees and brush.
 They can also kill invasive weeds that may cause environmental damage.
 Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant.
Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mould can damage structures such as houses.
 Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage rodents and insects that infest food such as grain.
 Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk.
 Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Canada.
 Pesticides can save farmers' money by preventing crop losses to insects and other pests; in the U.S., farmers get an estimated fourfold return on money they spend on pesticides.
One study found that not using pesticides reduced crop yields by about 10%.
 Another study, conducted in 1999, found that a ban on pesticides in the United States may result in a rise of food prices, loss of jobs, and an increase in world hunger.
 DDT, sprayed on the walls of houses, is an organochloride that has been used to fight malaria since the 1950s.
 Recent policy statements by the World Health Organization have given stronger support to this approach.
 Arata Kochi, WHO's malaria chief, said, "One of the best tools we have against malaria is indoor residual house spraying.
 Of the dozen insecticides WHO has approved as safe for house spraying, the most effective is DDT.
 However, since then, an October 2007 study has linked breast cancer from exposure to DDT prior to puberty.
 Poisoning may also occur due to use of DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons by entering the human food chain when animal tissues are affected.
 Symptoms include nervous excitement, tremors, convulsions or death.
   AmountsIn 2006 and 2008,the world used approximately 5.2 billion pounds of pesticides with herbicides constituting the majority of the world pesticide use at 40% followed by insecticides and fungicides with totals of 17% and 10% respectively.
 in 2006 and 2007, used approximately 1.1 billion pounds of pesticides accounting for 22% of the world total.
 For conventional pesticides which are used in the agricultural sector as well in industry, commercial, governmental and the home & garden sectors, the U.S.
 used at total of 857 million pounds, with the agricultural sector accounting for 80% of the conventional pesticide use total.
 Pesticides are also found in majority of U.S.
 households with 78 million out of the 105.5 million households indicating that they use some form of pesticide.
Currently,there are more than 1,055 active ingredients registered as pesticides, which are put together to produce over 16,000 pesticide products that are being marketed in the United States [23] [23]
  CostsOn the cost side of pesticide use there can be a cost to the environment and human health, as well as the cost of the development and research of new pesticides.
   A sign warning about potential pesticide exposure.Main articles:
 Health effects of pesticides and Pesticide poisoning poisoning
 Pesticides may cause acute and delayed health effects in those who are exposed.
 Pesticide exposure can cause a variety of adverse health effects.
 These effects can range from simple irritation of the skin and eyes to more severe effects such as affecting the nervous system, mimicking hormones causing reproductive problems, and also causing cancer.
A 2007 systematic review found that "most studies on non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia showed positive associations with pesticide exposure" and thus concluded that cosmetic use of pesticides should be decreased.
 Strong evidence also exists for other negative outcomes from pesticide exposure including neurological, birth defects, fetal death, and neurodevelopmental disorder.
 The American Medical Association recommends limiting exposure to pesticides and using safer alternatives: "Particular uncertainty exists regarding the long-term effects of low-dose pesticide exposures.
  The World Health Organization and the UN Environment Programme estimate that each year, 3 million workers in agriculture in the developing world experience severe poisoning from pesticides, about 18,000 of whom die.
According to one study, as many as 25 million workers in developing countries may suffer mild pesticide poisoning yearly.
 One study found pesticide self-poisoning the method of choice in one third of suicides worldwide, and recommended, among other things, more restrictions on the types of pesticides that are most harmful to humans.[30] humans.[30]
   Pesticide use raises a number of environmental concerns.
 Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including non-target species, air, water and soil.
 Pesticide drift occurs when pesticides suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them.
 Pesticides are one of the causes of water pollution, and some pesticides are persistent organic pollutants and contribute to soil contamination.
 In addition, pesticide use reduces biodiversity, reduces nitrogen fixation, contributes to pollinator decline,destroys habitat (especially for birds),[36] and threatens endangered species.[18] species.[18]
 Pests can develop a resistance to the pesticide (pesticide resistance), necessitating a new pesticide.
 Alternatively a greater dose of the pesticide can be used to counteract the resistance, although this will cause a worsening of the ambient pollution problem.
  Human health and environmental cost from pesticides in the United States is a total of $9.6 billion:
 Additional cost includes the registration process and the cost of purchase pesticides.
 The registration process can take several years to complete the 70 different types of field test and can cost between $50�70 million for a single pesticide.
Annually the United States spends $10 billion on pesticides.
  BenefitsThere are two levels of benefits for pesticide use, primary and secondary.
 Primary benefits are direct gains from the use of pesticides and secondary benefits are effects that are more long-term.
  MonetaryFor every dollar ($1) that is spent on pesticides for crops yields four dollars ($4) in crops saved.
 This means based on the amount of money spent per year on pesticides, $10 billion, that there is an additional $40 billion savings in crop that would be lost due to damage by insects and weeds.
 Generally speaking, farmers benefit from having an increase crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year.
 Consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year round.
 The general public also benefits from the use of pesticides for the control of insect-borne diseases and illnesses, such as malaria.
 The use of pesticides creates a large job market, which provides jobs for all of the people who work within the industry.
  AlternativesAlternatives to pesticides are available and include methods of cultivation, use of biological pest controls  genetic engineering, and methods of interfering with insect breeding.
 Application of composted yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pests.
 These methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides.
 In addition, EPA is registering reduced-risk conventional pesticides in increasing numbers.
 Cultivation practices include polyculture (growing multiple types of plants), crop rotation, planting crops in areas where the pests that damage them do not live, timing planting according to when pests will be least problematic, and use of trap crops that attract pests away from the real crop.
 In the U.S., farmers have had success controlling insects by spraying with hot water at a cost that is about the same as pesticide spraying.
 Release of other organisms that fight the pest is another example of an alternative to pesticide use.
 These organisms can include natural predators or parasites of the pests.
 Biological pesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses cause disease in the pest species can also be used.
 Interfering with insects' reproduction can be accomplished by sterilizing males of the target species and releasing them, so that they mate with females but do not produce offspring.
 This technique was first used on the screwworm fly in 1958 and has since been used with the medfly, the tsetse fly, and the gypsy moth.
 However, this can be a costly, time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.
 Another alternative to pesticides is the thermal treatment of soil through steam.
 Soil steaming kills pest and increases soil health.
 In India, traditional pest control methods include using Panchakavya, the "mixture of five products." The method has recently experienced a resurgence in popularity due in part to use by the organic farming community. needed]
  Push pull strategyThe term "push-pull" was established in 1987 as an approach for integrated pest management (IPM).
 This strategy uses a mixture of behavior-modifying stimuli to manipulate the distribution and abundance of insects.
 "Push" means the insects are repelled or deterred away from whatever resource that is being protected.
 "Pull" means that certain stimuli (semiochemical stimuli, pheromones, food additives, visual stimuli, genetically altered plants, etc.) are used to attract pests to trap crops where they will be killed [43] There are numerous different components involved in order to implement a Push-Pull Strategy in IPM.
 Many case studies testing the effectiveness of the push-pull approach have been done across the world.
 The most successful push-pull strategy was developed in Africa for subsistence farming.
 Another successful case study was performed on the control of Helicoverpa in cotton crops in Australia.
 In Europe, the Middle East, and the United States, push-pull strategies were successfully used in the controlling of Sitona lineatus in bean fields.
Plus many more cases where this strategy was more beneficial than simply using pesticides on their crops.
 Some advantages of using the push-pull method are less use of chemical or biological materials and better protection against insect habituation to this control method.
 Some disadvantages of the push-pull strategy is that if there is a lack of appropriate knowledge of behavioral and chemical ecology of the host-pest interactions then this method becomes unreliable.
 Furthermore, because the push-pull method is not a very popular method of IPM operational and registration costs are higher.
   EffectivenessSome evidence shows that alternatives to pesticides can be equally effective as the use of chemicals.
 For example, Sweden has halved its use of pesticides with hardly any reduction in crops.
 In Indonesia, farmers have reduced pesticide use on rice fields by 65% and experienced a 15% crop increase.
 However, pesticide resistance is increasing.
 farmers lost only 7% of their crops to pests.
 Since the 1980s, loss has increased to 13%, even though more pesticides are being used.
 Between 500 and 1,000 insect and weed species have developed pesticide resistance since 1945.
  Regulation InternationalIn Europe, recent EU legislation has been approved banning the use of highly toxic pesticides including those that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, those that are endocrine-disrupting, and those that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB).
 Measures were approved to improve the general safety of pesticides across all EU member states.
 Though pesticide regulations differ from country to country, pesticides and products on which they were used are traded across international borders.
 To deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries, delegates to a conference of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization adopted an International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for different countries.
 The Code was updated in 1998 and 2002.[48] The FAO claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use.[4] use.[4]
 Three other efforts to improve regulation of international pesticide trade are the United Nations London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade and the United Nations Codex Alimentarius Commission.
 The former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides, while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries.
 Both initiatives operate on a voluntary basis.[49] basis.[49]
 Pesticide safety education and pesticide applicator regulation are designed to protect the public from pesticide misuse, but do not eliminate all misuse.
 Reducing the use of pesticides and choosing less toxic pesticides may reduce risks placed on society and the environment from pesticide use.
 Integrated pest management, the use of multiple approaches to control pests, is becoming widespread and has been used with success in countries such as Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, the U.S., Australia, and Mexico.
 IPM attempts to recognize the more widespread impacts of an action on an ecosystem, so that natural balances are not upset.
 New pesticides are being developed, including biological and botanical derivatives and alternatives that are thought to reduce health and environmental risks.
 In addition, applicators are being encouraged to consider alternative controls and adopt methods that reduce the use of chemical pesticides.
 Pesticides can be created that are targeted to a specific pest's life cycle, which can be environmentally more friendly.
For example, potato cyst nematodes emerge from their protective cysts in response to a chemical excreted by potatoes; they feed on the potatoes and damage the crop.
 A similar chemical can be applied to fields early, before the potatoes are planted, causing the nematodes to emerge early and starve in the absence of potatoes.
 Preparation for an application of hazardous pesticide in USA.In most countries, pesticides must be approved for sale and use by a government agency.
 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for regulating pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA).
 Complex and costly studies must be conducted to indicate whether the material is safe to use and effective against the intended pest.
 The EPA regulates pesticides to ensure that these products do not pose adverse effects to humans or the environment.
 Pesticides produced before November 1984 continue to be reassessed in order to meet the current scientific and regulatory standards.
 All registered pesticides are reviewed every 15 years to ensure they meet the proper standards.
 During the registration process, a label is created.
 The label contains directions for proper use of the material.
 Based on acute toxicity, pesticides are assigned to a Toxicity Class.
 Some pesticides are considered too hazardous for sale to the general public and are designated restricted use pesticides.
 Only certified applicators, who have passed an exam, may purchase or supervise the application of restricted use pesticides.
 Records of sales and use are required to be maintained and may be audited by government agencies charged with the enforcement of pesticide regulations. needed]
 The EPA regulates pesticides under two under main acts, both of which were amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996.
 In addition to the EPA, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set standards for the level of pesticide residue that is allowed on or in crops [53] The EPA looks at what the potential human health and environmental effects might be associated with the use of the pesticide.
 Additionally, the U.S.
 EPA uses the National Research Council's four-step process for human health risk assessment:
 (1) Hazard Identification, (2) Dose-Response Assessment, (3) Exposure Assessment, and (4) Risk Characterization.
  HistorySince before 2000 BC, humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops.
 The first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia.
 By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests.
 In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide.
 The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which is derived from the roots of tropical vegetables.[56] Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant.[57] Paul M�ller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide.
 Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S.
 by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975.
 Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide.
 Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by "triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate".
 The first legislation providing federal authority for regulating pesticides was enacted in 1910;[58] however, decades later during the 1940s manufacturers began to produce large amounts of synthetic pesticides and their use became widespread.
Some sources consider the 1940s and 1950s to have been the start of the "pesticide era."[59] Although the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency was established in 1970 and amendments to the pesticide law in 1972,[60] pesticide use has increased 50-fold since 1950 and 2.3 million tonnes (2.5 million short tons) of industrial pesticides are now used each year.
 Seventy-five percent of all pesticides in the world are used in developed countries, but use in developing countries is increasing.[18] In 2001 the EPA stopped reporting yearly pesticide use statistics.
 A study of USA pesticide use trends through 1997 was published in 2003 by the National Science Foundation's Center for Integrated Pest Management.
 In the 1960s, it was discovered that DDT was preventing many fish-eating birds from reproducing, which was a serious threat to biodiversity.
 Rachel Carson wrote the best-selling book Silent Spring about biological magnification.
 The agricultural use of DDT is now banned under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, but it is still used in some developing nations to prevent malaria and other tropical diseases by spraying on interior walls to kill or repel mosquitoes.[62] mosquitoes.[62]
 Around 51 agricultural foods are contaminated with pesticide residues and of these, 20 per cent has pesticide residues more than the maximum residue limit in India.
 India produces 85,000 tonnes of pesticides every year.
 The pesticide endosulfan was recently banned by the government, but many other chemical pesticides continue to be used for a better, higher and quicker yield, as they prevent crops from being destroyed by pests.
 Dr Padmaja Rambabu of the food and drug toxicology department and assistant director at the National Institute of Nutrition, says that as long as banned pesticides are produced by manufacturers and available in the market, farmers will continue to use them.
 �Sometimes, pesticides like monocrotophos, which is banned for vegetables but recommended for other food crops, continues to be used even for vegetables in the absence of proper awareness among farmers and lack of fool-proof monitoring.� monitoring.�
 Farmers don�t wear protective apparel to protect themselves from the toxic affects of the pesticides they use.
 Ignorance causes many farmers to use more than the recommended amount in the hope that it will benefit the crops more.
 Excessive use of pesticides means it can penetrate into fruits and vegetables.
 It also causes the pests to develop resistance, and geno-toxicity in the produce.
 Farmers are reluctant to use good agricultural practices like allowing the �safe period�.
 Explains Dr Padmaja, �Certain vegetables, including tomatoes, cabbage, brinjal, green leafy vegetables and lady�s finger (okra) are prone to heavy pest infestation.
 Pesticides are used even post harvest.
 To dissipate the effects of the residue, vegetables like okra should not be sold in the market for a couple of weeks or so after harvesting.
 But agriculturalists, who are in a hurry to sell their products, often violate such practices.
 Pesticide residues are the very small amounts of pesticides that can remain in or on a crop after harvesting or storage and make their way into the food chain.
 Not all foods contain pesticide residues, and where they do occur they are typically at very low levels.
 Pesticide residues also include any breakdown products from the pesticide.
 Pesticide residues can remain even when pesticides are applied in the right amount and at the right time.
 Sometimes they need to stay on the crop to do their job.
 For example, they may need to be on the surface of a fruit or vegetable to protect it from pests during storage.
 Some pesticides are applied after harvest for this purpose.
 Apart from vindicating CSE's findings the JPC report has also revealed some of the glaring loopholes ingrained in the existing norms and regulations dealing with food safety in India and has called for urgent actions on part of the central as well as state governments to restructure the entire regulatory framework so as to ensure better food safety and public health for the people of the country.
 However, while there is no doubt that such regulatory reforms are required to be undertaken on an urgent basis, this is high time to do a fresh assessment of the risks of 'green-revolution technology', the wasteful application of which has led to India's ground water contamination problem in the first place.
 Also there is a strong case for the government supporting a shift to organic agriculture and this will be made in the second half of this article.
 While the JPC report has acknowledged the need for better agricultural practices no recommendation has been made to restructure the existing policy framework, which is still nurturing the agro-chemical based conventional agriculture, the other name of which is the 'green revolution technology'.
 It is true that the green revolution has succeeded in transforming the Indian economy from a situation of severe food shortage into one where the country has not only become self-reliant in food production but has also been able to generate a sizable surplus for export.
 However, the high doses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which have been used under this 'conventional' farming technology (along with 'high yielding varieties of seeds' and irrigation) are now causing severe environmental and health hazards, including the contamination of ground water.
 Agrochemicals pollute the environment primarily because of their wasteful application and due to the fact that crops use them inefficiently.
 Fertilizer use efficiency is revealed to be only 30-35%; the remaining proportion reaching the underground water resources.
 Since chemical fertilizers do not supply humus (which plays a vital role in holding the nutrients required by plants), so the nutrient and water-holding capacity of the soil becomes very low.
 This in turn, results in unacceptable soil erosion and runoff and in associated losses of nutrients and pesticides.
 Sediment from erosion is known to be the greatest pollutant of surface water and is a major carrier of agrochemicals into the water system.
 It is now well understood that the indiscriminate use of agrochemicals under conventional agriculture not only causes severe health hazards for human beings but also has numerous other side effects on the environment including destruction of the biodiversity.
 Last but not the least, the adverse impacts of conventional farming on the health of agricultural system itself makes it unsustainable in the longer run.
 Because, the losses of soil organic matter, sediments and nutrients caused by widespread erosion and run-off result in a degradation of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil.
 This, in turn, accelerates the rate of erosion, further fueling the nutrient loss.
 Thus soil productivity decreases over time and affects the plant growth adversely leaving the farmers with no other option than to apply increased doses of fertilizers.
 However, such increased application of fertilizers only aggravates the problem of erosion with little or no addition to the soil productivity.
 There is also an intrinsic vicious cycle that needs mention.
 The standard fertilizer package of N-P-K (Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potash) under conventional agriculture also results in deficiency of certain essential elements (e.g.
 trace elements) among the plants often making them more vulnerable to pest and disease attacks.
 Such vulnerability necessitates application of ever-increasing doses of toxic pesticides thereby raising the level of pesticide residues in crops along with further aggravation in contamination of water resources.
 Moreover such high doses of pesticides generate resistance among the pests over time and cause more damage to the beneficial organisms of the soil (the predators).
 Thus the ecological balance that exists between the plants and their pests (through natural competition, selection and predator-prey relationship) gets disrupted often resulting in new, previously innocuous pests emerging as serious threats.
 To take an example, in Punjab, the mono-cultivation of paddy-wheat rotation ever since the advent of the green revolution technology in the mid-1960s, has resulted in such serious degradation of land, water and environment that the sustainability of the current pattern of agricultural practices is now under question.
 There are indications of significant changes in the natural resource base e.g.
 falling ground water table, water logging, degradation of soil health (loss of organic carbon and deficiency of micro and secondary nutrients like zinc, manganese, iron and sulphur), severe soil erosion, and so on.
 Given the massive depletion of organic content and plant nutrients in the soil, Punjab farmers are now compelled to use more and more chemical fertilizers and other inputs to achieve the same production level.
 The law of diminishing returns has set in.
 The productivity of rice and wheat, the major crops of the state, which occupy about 70 per cent of its gross cropped area, is reported to have approached a plateau and farm incomes are reported to be stagnant and insufficient for a decent living.
 The ground realities of Punjab show that the conventional agriculture in India has reached a stage where the use of fertilizers and pesticides cannot be stopped and at the same time there is no sign of further increase in productivity and production through their increased application.
 The only solution seems to lie in going organic! organic!
 What is organic agriculture?
 A widely used definition of organic agriculture is the one provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which defines it as "�a production system which avoids or largely excludes the use of synthetically compounded fertilizers, pesticides, growth regulators and livestock feed additives.
 To the maximum extent feasible, organic farming systems rely upon crop rotations, crop residues, animal manure, legumes, green manure, off-farm organic wastes, mechanical cultivation, mineral bearing rocks and aspects of biological pest control to maintain soil productivity and tilth, to supply plant nutrients and to control insects, weeds and other pests." pests."
 In a nutshell, organic agriculture is a holistic production management system, which enhances the health of the agroecosystem, including biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity, thereby increasing the fertility of the soil and making the agricultural system sustainable in the longer run.
 Moreover, as organic farming refrains from using chemical inputs, the health hazards and other side effects posed by those inputs are also prevented.
 In the modern sense, 'organic' is a labeling term that denotes products that have been produced in accordance with certain legally defined standards and norms (which are codified in a number of formal standards) and certified by a duly constituted certification authority.
 It is the market for this kind of 'certified organic' food, which has now turned out to be the most rapidly growing food sector of the developed countries (especially, the USA, the EU and Japan), where it fetches a handsome premium as it is perceived to be safer, healthier, environment-friendly and socially responsible.
 But other than niche NGO supported farmers, will organic agriculture work in India -- with its millions of small farmers and small landholdings?
 First, the concept of organic agriculture is not something alien to India.
 In fact, the first 'scientific' approach to organic farming can be quoted back to the Vedas of the 'Later Vedic Period', the essence of which is to live in partnership with, rather than exploit, nature.
 More recently, Mahatma Gandhi pioneered organic agriculture through his constructive programmes in several locations in India.
 It was the aggressive promotion of green revolution, which had led to a set back in the spread of organic farming through Gandhian movement.
 Second, there are evidences to suggest that small farmers, especially in the Third World, are much more likely to apply agricultural practices such as crop rotations, mixed cropping (e.g., intercropping - where the empty space between the rows is occupied by other crops), which are essential building blocks of organic farming.
 They are also usually observed to combine agriculture with livestocks and utilize the manure to replenish the soil fertility.
 Large farmers generally tend to plant monocultures because they are the simplest to manage with heavy machinery.
 Empirical evidence further suggests that while conventional agriculture goes better with large holdings, organic farming functions better in small-scale farms.
 A study, by Hanson, Lichtenberg and Peters, comparing grain production in organic vis-a-vis conventional methods, determined that "as farm size increases, the advantages of organic rotation become less visible." Organic farming was found to be more profitable and productive than conventional farming on a smaller scale, in this study.
 Only one fifth of the dryland farmers in India use chemical inputs, the rest relying upon manure and green compost for maintaining soil fertility.
 Third, it is estimated that only around 30% of the total cultivable area in India, where irrigation facilities are available, is covered under green revolution technology; the remaining 70% (approximately) of arable land, where rainfed or dryfarming is practiced, do not, generally, use agro-chemicals.
 According to an estimate made by the Institute of Integrated Rural Development in 2001, only one fifth of the dryland farmers in India use chemical inputs, the rest relying upon manure and green compost for maintaining soil fertility.
 The great majority of these people are peasants, indigenous people and small family farmers with very little capital, who still farm valleys and slopes using traditional methods, often in highly heterogeneous and risk-prone marginal environments.
 In fact, given their situation, these farmers have little alternative but to rely upon locally available natural resources to maintain soil fertility and to combat pests and diseases.
 Whatever may be the reasons, the fact remains that the diverse farming systems managed by such small farmers could be considered as 'organic', as they do not rely on synthetic chemical pesticides or fertilizers and use technologies that optimize nutrient flows and use local resources such as native seeds and traditional knowledge.
 In technical terms such farms are called 'de-facto organic' (as distinct from 'certified organic') farms, i.e., farms that rely exclusively on natural methods of building soil fertility and combating pests and diseases, but are not inspected and verified by any organic certification agency.
 The lucrative market of the developed world has so far acted as the primary driving force behind the development of the 'certified organic' sector in India, which is still at a nascent stage in this country.
 According to one estimate, in 1999 merely 0.001% of the total agricultural land of India was under certified organic cultivation.
 It is predominantly the NGOs and people's organizations that have been spearheading the organic agriculture movement in different parts of the country during the last two decades.
 Very recently the Government has shown signs of getting involved.
 For instance, a special cell has been set up under the Agricultural and Processed Food Export Development Authority (APEDA) of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOCI).
 The MOCI has also come out with a 'National Programme of Organic Products' (NPOP) in 2000, and the 'India Organic' logo in 2002.
 While all these initiatives have been undertaken to promote exports of Indian organic products, the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation has formulated a 'National Project on Organic Farming' to promote organic agriculture as part of an exercise to curb the use of chemical pesticides and make agricultural activity more eco-friendly.
 Such initiatives are a step in the right direction, but they should be weighed against the huge subsidies that the Central Government is still providing for the production and import of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
 There is a huge potential for organic farming to flourish in this country and given an appropriate institutional and policy framework, it will not be very difficult to promote the existing 'de-facto organic' farms to the category of 'certified organic' farms.
 This will enable those small farmers to take advantage of the lucrative market for 'certified organic' products in the developed world, which can directly contribute towards the improvement of their economic well-being.
 Moreover, besides being a technological or market option, organic farming can very well become a philosophy for sustainable rural development in India.
 Some of the steps required to be taken in this direction are noted as under:
 Appropriate research and extension services should be developed to make available to the small farmers all the relevant information on organic farming, in general, and its specific technical details, in particular.
 Certification and labelling capacities should be developed within the country so as to overcome the prohibitive costs involved in getting certification done by external agencies.
 Certification processes should be simplified and made accessible to small farmers.
 Biofertilisers, bioagents, biopesticides and other organic inputs should be made available to the small land holders at sufficient quantities and reasonable prices.
 Domestic market for organic products, which is still at a budding stage in this country, should be encouraged and developed.
 Marketing linkages, both domestic and international, should be ensured for resource-poor small farmers.
 Subsidies and other financial support schemes should be undertaken to help the small growers bear the initial expenses for converting to 'certified organic' farms, and so on.
 In conclusion, our national and state agricultural policies should move forward and away from maintaining current double standards.
 What we need instead is the necessary institutional and policy framework that can pave the way for the promotion of organic agriculture on a nation-wide scale.
 Because this is the only means that can ensure the sustainability of Indian agriculture in the long run, while at the same time providing a healthier and more habitable environment.
 This requires nothing less than a paradigm shift in the agricultural policies of the Government of India and the state governments.
 Indian seafood exports to Japan have hit a bump after the foreign country�s food regulator detected pesticide residues in cultured shrimp consignment from India.
 The incident has triggered off concerns as Japan is the second largest importer of Indian seafood items after the European Union (EU).
 The Japanese Food and Safety Authority (JFSA) has detected Pendimethalin, a pesticide residue, beyond the standard level in a cultured shrimp consignment from a company based in Tamil Nadu�s Tuticorin, according to industry sources.
 Any Japanese action will jeopardise India�s performance in exports as this sector is currently reeling from issues such as low international offtake due to the economic slowdown and cancellation of orders from EU and South Africa.
 In the wake of the detection, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has alerted the Japanese Quarantine Station Directors (QSD) to strengthen monitoring and inspection of shrimps imported from India.
 QSD has already enhanced the frequency of quality check and 30 per cent of the Indian consignments would be checked thoroughly by the quarantine stations, sources said.
 The ministry also warned that in case of any further non-compliance of safety standard, a complete inspection of consignments of Indian shrimp will be imposed as per the Japanese Food Sanitation Law.
 According to sources, this may further lead to a complete ban on the Indian imports.
 Meanwhile, the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) � which acts as a co-ordinating agency with different Central and state government establishments engaged in marine products and allied activities � has alerted the Tuticorin-based company to comply �strictly� with the quality standards.
 It has also alerted the Seafood Exporters Association of India (SEAI) to follow stringent quality control measures while procuring and processing cultured shrimp for export to Japan.
 This is made in order to avoid �100 per cent inspection�.
 MPEDA sources said that JFSA had detected pesticide residue only in one consignment that might have happened due to the water used for agricultural purpose.
 Of late, the export sector has had some good news as the US had reduced the average anti-dumping duty to 0.79 per cent and withdrawn the customs bond requirement.
 In a startling revelation, 12 brands of organic tea, tested by the Consumer Education and Research Society (CERS) in Ahmedabad, showed traces of heavy metals in them.
 The findings have been published by CERS in the March-April 2011 issue of its consumer magazine, Insight.
 Of the 12 brands, seven were procured from Germany, though produced in India, and the rest were purchased in the local markets.
 Three conventional tea brands, which did not claim to be organic, were also tested for comparison.
 All 15 tea brands contained traces of heavy metals, though within the specified limits.
 CERS tested the brands for the presence of heavy metals, like lead and copper, besides pesticide residues like lindane, aldrin, dieldrin, DDT, endosulfan, dicofol and ethion.
 Among the tea brands claiming to be organic, the highest amount of lead was found in �Organic India Tulsi Green� and the lowest in �Indien Gold - Broken�.
 Interestingly, the highest level of lead found in conventional tea (not claiming to be organic) was in �Wagh Bakri Strong CTC� and the lowest in �Tata Tea Premium� and �Brooke Bond Red Label�.
 Among the organic tea brands, the highest amount of copper was found in �Assam Strong Leaves� and the lowest in �Organic India Tulsi Ginger�.
 And though the three conventional tea brands � Tata Tea Premium, Brooke Bond Red Label and Wagh Bakri Strong CTC � contained pesticide residues like DDT, Dicofol and Ethion, these were within the specified limits.
 Since there are no analytical standards for organic tea in India or elsewhere, CERS followed the standards applicable to conventional tea.
 The organic tea samples were tested against the values set by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) IS:
 3633-1972 (specification for tea) and the Prevention of Food and Adulteration (PFA) Act and Rules, 1955.
 CERS has recommended that the BIS should make organic certification mandatory for organic tea and other organic food products.
 CERS is of the opinion that the BIS should monitor the quality of pesticide formulations used in tea plantations for the presence of chemical contaminants.
 It also called on the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to revise and bring down the maximum limits for metal contaminants in tea, especially for lead, and make the standards stricter.
 It has asked the FSSAI to review the current levels of pesticides in tea and harmonise the PFA Standards for tea with the BIS Standards.
 A Wagh Bakri tea spokesperson was quoted by CERC as stating that lead and copper could not be removed completely as they were present in the soil and water and were absorbed by the plant.
 On the other hand, a Hindustan Unilever (HUL) spokesperson said the test results showed that the contaminant levels were much below the maximum residue limit (MRL) prescribed in the PFA.
 HUL clarified that it did not own any tea estate and purchased tea at the auction centres regulated by the Tea Board of India.
 A Tata Tea spokesperson said, �The environmental contamination through air and soil was responsible for lead contamination in tea plants, on which we have no control.
 In being one of the largest pesticide producers in Asia, India has made some mark in controlling pests, but in return has ruined its water resources.
 Even though nationwide data does not exist, isolated studies have started showing how groundwater and river systems are contaminated with pesticide residues, not removable by standard water filters.
 Now, a team of researchers from IIT-Madras has developed nanoparticles that can eliminate one of the most difficult-to-remove class of chemicals in pesticides called organochlorine.
 Almost every organochlorine studied has been seen to cause some environmental or human health hazard and includes notorious pesticides like DDT, endosulfan, dioxin, HCH (hexachlorocyclohexane) and aldrin.
 �Even though some of these pesticides have been banned, they are very much present in the environment.
 For instance, endosulfan has an environmental lifetime of 100 years,� says T.
  His nanoparticles, mostly from gold, silver, copper and several oxides, are effective on endosulfan even at very low concentration.
 �Efficient chemistry at low concentration is important so that even if one molecule of the pesticide passes by, it gets removed by the nanoparticle,� adds Pradeep.
 With an Indian and US patent in hand, Pradeep has licensed part of his work to Eureka Forbes Ltd, makers of vacuum cleaners and water purifiers, which in June 2007 introduced a novel nanosilver filter in some brands.
 �We wanted to productize and demonstrate our technology and create some excitement.
 So we took up initial industrial development at IIT,� notes Pradeep.
 But any technology of this kind, he believes, needs to go the �real sufferers in rural areas�.
 His current nanoparticles are effective on four most common organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) � DDT, endosulfan, malathion, and chlorpyrifos.
 More than 40% pesticides used in India belong to the organochlorine category, known for their resistance to environmental degradation.
 There has been no national study yet but some patchy studies are being undertaken.
 For instance, a study by the Industrial Toxicological Research Centre (ITRC) in Lucknow published in the international journal Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology in May 2007 shows high level residues of OCPs in fish from the Gomti River .
 Another Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-commissioned study on groundwater sources by ITRC in Kanpur shows beyond permissible levels of DDT, HCH and endosulfan, according to Kunwar P.
 Singh, one of the lead researchers.
 A 2005-study on Ludhiana and Muktsar districts of Punjab, now expanded to other neighbouring regions, by the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) in Hyderabad showed WHO-exceeding levels of OCPs like endosulfan, DDT, malathion and others.
 �We do not have national data; it�s only recently that the Department of Science and Tehcnology has initiated such studies,� said Gurunadha Rao, a scientist at NGRI.
  Eureka is interested in taking this technology to rural population but the high cost of manufacturing could hinder the outreach for some time.
 �We intend to take this up as a no-loss, no-profit venture but that will have to wait until production goes up (and cost comes down),� says Abhay Kumar , general manager of water technologies division at Eureka in Bangalore.
 A community water purifier prototype, using nanotechnology filter, is under construction.
 It is scheduled to be installed in Kasargod district, one of the endosulfan-affected areas in Kerala, by March.
 �This effort has to multiply, through all possible channels � industry, non-governmental organization and most importantly, government machinery,� says Pradeep, whose interaction with the Central water resources ministry turned out to be a one-way affair.
 Under the US Clean Water Act of 1972, the extent of contaminants in a glass of water is decreasing, but the number of contaminants entering potable water is increasing, says Pradeep.
 Experts believe eventually nanomaterial is the way to purify not only water but even ambient air indoors.
 �Many of these organics are extremely stable in the environment.
 Hence, chemistry of novel materials is the need,� argues Pradeep.
 Given India�s poor global ranking in drinking water quality (a 2003 UN report ranked India 120 among 122 nations in quality of water), the international aid agency World Vision India (WVI), headquartered in Hyderabad, is involved in some water purification progammes.
 �We are keen to find out how we can adapt this nanotechnology for rural masses,� says Franklin Joseph, director, Humanitarian and Emergency Affairs.
 WVI, which has a collaboration with Eureka, is now entering into an agreement with the Water and Process Technologies division of General Electric Company to use their reverse osmosis technology, suitable for removing salt and fluoride from water.
 Pradeep�s group has also developed a pesticide test kit, slated to enter the market this year.
 One of the early proponents of nanotechnology for water purification when he came to IIT Madras 14 years ago from Purdue University in Indiana, US, Pradeep now has a slew of new nano materials that could free water from heavy metals like lead and mercury and other OCPs.
 But his worry is:
 How do we develop a mechanism to take such technologies to the masses?
 While Indian exports go through tight scrutiny, it seems the checks for what India eats are missing.
 A recent report, which analysed sample food items from 13 states in 20 laboratories across the country between 2008 and 2009, found pesticide residues either banned or recommended for restricted use, writes Savvy Soumya Misra Misra
 The country�s regulators have failed to check the flow of pesticides into the food chain, suggests a monitoring report of the Department of Agriculture and the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, the country�s premier institute.
 Fruits, vegetables, poultry and milk are all laced with high pesticide residues �much above the maximum residue limits (MRL) set by the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act of 1954.
 Samples of a milk brand collected from Ahmedabad, for instance, had the highest traces of chlorpyriphos, a known carcinogen that can also cause neural disorders.
 The report, which analysed sample food items from 13 states in 20 laboratories across the country between 2008 and 2009, also found several food had residues of pesticides that are either banned in the country or are recommended for restricted use.
 DDT, for instance, is not recommended for vegetables.
 But traces of it�108 times the recommended MRL�was found in tomatoes.
 Residues of banned pesticides like aldrin, chlordane, chlorfenyinfos and heptachlor were found in samples of vegetables, apple, rice, wheat, milk and butter; most were from Uttar Pradesh.
 �The report shows a lapse in the regulatory system,� said G V Ramanjaneyulu, executive director of the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, a non-profit in Hyderabad.
 �Never has a state agriculture officer visited the fields to see which pesticides we use and in what proportions,� said Kultar Singh, farmer from Faridkot in Punjab.
 Monocrotophos, a pesticide recommended only for cotton farms, is used extensively on vegetables in Punjab, Singh added.
 Though the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has uploaded the report on its website, the government is in no mood to own the data in its entirety.
 When asked about the report, the agriculture department refused to comment and there was no response from the Central Insecticides Board, responsible for regulating pesticides.
 An official associated with the report, on condition of anonymity, said the government has informed state agriculture departments about food items that had high pesticide residues.
 But the report�s data on banned pesticides are �unconfirmed�, �inaccurate� and have �a few aberrations�, he said, blaming it on �evolving technology� in the laboratories.
 The data for 2009-10 would be accurate as technologies have improved, he added.
 His claim, though, raise question over the data generated by these laboratories for a decade now.
 The report also brings to light the failure of state agriculture departments and extension services in ensuring that farmers use only recommended pesticides for a particular crop or pest.
 Tea samples from Assam, for instance, had 4.280 ppm (parts per million) fenpropathrin.
 The UN food standards, CODEX, fixes its MRL at 2 ppm.
 The Central Insecticides Board does not recommend it for use in tea plants and has not fixed its MRL under the prevention of food adulteration (PFA) Act.
 The official said Tea Board of India is lately promoting fenpropathrin as replacement for dicofol, a miticide.
 Instead of cracking the whip on the Tea Board, the agriculture ministry is contemplating label expansion, meaning, expanding the use of a particular pesticide for more crops.
 Ramanjaneyulu said there is not enough research by agriculture universities to support label expansion.
 In fact, several pesticides like fenpropathrin do not have set MRL due to lack of research and their residues are never traced in food in the country, he added.
 The report also shows fruits from US and China contain high pesticide residues, including the banned aldrin.
 While Indian exports go through a tight scrutiny, it seems the checks for what India eats are missing.
 FSSAI, which is responsible for ensuring a safe food supply, has just issued an advisory to state food authorities to take legal action for violation of the PFA Act.
 EPA sets limits on how much of a pesticide residue can remain on food and feed products, or commodities.
 These pesticide residue limits are known as tolerances.
 Tolerances are set to protect you from harmful levels of pesticides on your food.
in australia, approximately 400 of the 16,000 people who have been diagnosed with chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (cfids) have been tested and found to have excessively high levels of chemical residues including pesticides in their bodies.
 Inspectors from the Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture monitor food in interstate commerce to ensure that these limits are not exceeded.
 The Environmental Protection Agency sets maximum residue limits (MRLs), or tolerances, for pesticides that can be used on various food and feed commodities.
 Below are two resources for maximum residue limits (MRLs), or tolerance information.
 Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) (e-CFR)
 Look up the preferred commodity term.
 Consult the Food and Feed Commodity Vocabulary.
 The names of agricultural food and feed products, or commodities, are being standardized.
 The preferred commodity term is the only term accepted in establishing pesticide tolerances.
  The results returned from the e-CFR are the pesticides that have MRLs or tolerances for that commodity.
 Also provided are the results for Part 180, Subpart C that contain the specific tolerances.

 The Web site provides various types of pesticide toxicology and environmental chemistry information (e.g., pesticide profiles, fact sheets, information briefs, newsletters, etc.) etc.)
 USDA's Pesticide Data Program provides an overview of the pesticide residues found on food through this sampling program.
 Abstract:
 Pesticide residue analysis carried out at the farm gate, market level and other spatial scales may be of immense significance as an indicator of the potential risks that pesticide exposure has on human health.
 Cabbage samples at the farm-gate were analysed to determine the types of pesticides used by vegetable farmers in Cape Coast and ascertain whether levels of pesticide residues are below permissible Maximum Residue Limits.
 Twenty-one pesticide residues were detected in the cabbage samples of which 9 are pyrethroids and 12 are organophosphates.
 Pesticide residues at levels exceeding the Maximum Residue Limits were found in more than two-thirds of the total number of samples.
 The results are as follows:
 Allethrin (1.52411�3.024054 mg kg-1), deltamethrin (4.74690�1.694768 mg kg-1), cypermethrin (0.31180�0.367967 mg kg-1), fenvalerate 2 (0.20590�0.150179 mg kg-1), permethrin (0.14700�0.066119 mg kg-1), ethoprophos (1.13544�0.442078 �g g-1), phorate (0.67820�0.809661 �g g-1), chlorfenvinp (0.31520�0.155821 �g g-1) and fenitrothion (0.16500�0.189241 �g g-1).
 High levels of pesticide residue were observed for allenthrin (9.566 mg kg-1) and phorate (2.077 �g g-1).
 Three of the pesticide residues (cypermethrin, permethrin and parathion) are considered to be potentially carcinogenic.
 Methamidophos and fenvalerate are the only pesticide residues that were not detected in any of the samples whereas fonofos, profenofos, clorfenvinp and pirimiphos-methyl were restricted to cabbage samples from only one location.
 Strong correlations exist among a number of pesticide residues suggesting a common origin.
 Principal component analysis indicates that the data is a two-component system explaining 63% of total variance.
 Component 1 shows strong positive factor loadings on cypermethrin, deltamethrin and cyfluthrin 3 whereas component 2 shows strong negative factor loadings on phorate and fenvalerate 2.
 Cluster analysis grouped the pesticide residues into two spatially dissimilar categories of 6 and 4 members.
 The high levels and wide assortment of pesticide residues found in this study suggest the need to put into effect regulations regarding the proper use of pesticides on vegetables.
 Pesticides are used to protect crops before and after harvest from infestation by pests and plant diseases.
 A possible consequence of their use may be the presence of pesticide residues in the treated products.
 It is necessary to ensure that such residues should not be found in food or feed at levels presenting an unacceptable risk to humans.
 Maximum residue levels (MRLs) are therefore set by the European Commission to protect consumers from exposure to unacceptable levels of pesticides residues in food and feed.
 In the EU, as from 1 September 2008, a new legislative framework (Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council) on pesticide residues is applicable.
 This Regulation completes the harmonisation and simplification of pesticide MRLs, whilst ensuring better consumer protection throughout the EU.
 With the new rules, MRLs undergo a common EU assessment to make sure that all classes of consumers, including the vulnerable ones, like babies and children, are sufficiently protected.
 Moreover, the new harmonised Community provisions also facilitate commerce, by eliminating inappropriate technical barriers to trade.
 All decision-making in this area has to be science-based and a consumer intake assessment has to be carried out by the European Food Safety Authority before concluding on the safety of an MRL.
 The Latin American Pesticide Residue Workshop (LAPRW) is a biannual open forum for discussion on current concepts and future developments in the field of pesticide residues in food and the environment environment
 The Latin American Pesticide Residue Workshop (LAPRW) is a biannual open forum for discussion on current concepts and future developments in the field of pesticide residues in food and the environment.
 The first workshop was held in Santa Maria, Brazil (2007) and the second one took place in Santa Fe, Argentina (2009).
 The 3rd LAPRW will be held in Montevideo, Uruguay from the 8th to the 11th may 2011.
 The objective of the workshop is to exchange information, experiences and strategies bringing together academia, industry and government.
 It is an unique opportunity to share in the same event lectures from top scientists in the field and to hear the opinion of the regulating offices from Latin America, USA and Europe in a key issue not only from an academic point , but also decisive for public health and global world trade of commodities.
 The Universidad de la Rep�blica, Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) and Pharmacognosy & Natural Products,Organic Chemistry Department, hosts and organizers of the workshop, in cooperation with other national and international institutions, warmly invite you to participate in this important event.
 Today's consumers in Europe can buy about every fruit or vegetable at every time of the year for a decent price.
 This wealth of product diversity is possible due to the application of huge amounts of agricultural chemicals in the conventional production system.
 Millions of tons of mineral fertilizers and pesticides are sprayed worldwide on fields and orchards each year - and certain amounts of such pesticides remain as residues in the food we eat.
 Consumers in Europe are concerned about pesticide residues in food.
 A recent survey showed that 71% of the EU citizens are worried about pesticide residues in fruit, vegetables or cereals.
 The pesticide residues in fruit and vegetables are still alarming.
 The newest EU-Report about the contamination of food with pesticide residues does not show any improvement of the overall situation.
 Residues of pesticides in food can still pose acute health risks for consumers.
 PAN-Germany provides this website to give consumers information about pesticide residues in food by country and EU-wide.
 NOTE! � While all care has been taken to ensure that the information in the PAN Germany website is as accurate as possible at the time of preparation, PAN Germany and its funders take no responsibility for any errors or omissions in the original data sources or for data sources that may have changed since incorporation into the website.
  In view of a sharp rise in public concern over food safety, most of the Asian Pacific (AP) countries have made utmost efforts to reduce agro-chemical residues in food, rticularly in the perishable fruits and vegetables.
 However, farmers in tropical and sub-tropical climates have to spray chemical pesticides frequently for harvesting pest-free fruits and vegetables thus resulting in considerable risk of contamination of the agricultural produce.
 The concentration of various agro-chemical residues allowable in food are periodically discussed and recommended by the Codex Alimentarius based on strict scientific Risk Assessment.
 Some developed countries such as Japan have adopted the Codex standard on the chemical residues for domestic as well as imported agricultural products.
 Accordingly, a highly sophisticated analytical technology is required to monitor pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables for export to these countries.
 However, small-scale farmers are major contributors to domestic agricultural production in most of the developing countries of the AP region, for whom as well as to protect local consumers from contaminated fruits and vegetables a simple and less costly alternative method is urgently required to replace the sophisticated residue analysis technology.
 A Rapid Bioassay for Pesticide Residues (RBPR) was developed in Taiwan in 1985 and since then it has been successfully adopted as a supplement to sophisticated chemical analysis for the routine residue-test by more than 200 stations over the island covering farmer associations, various food supply systems and major supermarket chains.
 Compared to the standardized instrument/chemical analysis used by many developed countries, PBPR has both advantages and disadvantages; for instance, less-costly, simple and rapid operation and no need for intensive training on sophisticated instruments are the advantages, while low accuracy and precision, and inapplicability to all the chemical pesticides are its disadvantages.
 This training course is targeted for experts/stakeholders responsible for implementation of food safety policy directly and/or indirectly ranging from government researchers and inspection officers to laboratory technicians and extension workers, and aims to equip them with a working knowledge of RBPR for fruits and vegetables.
 This training course will be implemented by FFTC and TARI in collaboration with APAARI and sponsored by COA-Taiwan, ROC.
 Participants for the training will be nominated by APAARI and other organizations in the AP region.
 The training course will be held at the Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute (TARI), where the participants will undergo intensive lectures and hands-on experience of the RBPR technique/methodology, and on-site visits to rapid bioassay stations for technical orientation in Taiwan.
 Objectives:
  To acquaint the participants with the basic principles of RBPR and its applicable limitations for rapid monitoring of pesticide residues; residues;
 To provide with a working knowledge of the RBPR technology for fruits and vegetables; vegetables;
  To highlight the importance of �Risk Communication� for promotion of consumer acceptance of RBPR for food safety; and and
  To facilitate trainee/farmer education on the proper use of chemical pesticides under intensive farming.
 Tentative topics:
 Training course contents to be covered include the following:
  Prospects of rapid monitoring and control of pesticide residues in the AP region and the Food Quality Protection Act in the US US
 The training course will essentially consist of lectures, discussions, practicum (hands-on training) and field visits to observe practical application of RBPR in production sites, auction and wholesale markets of fruits and vegetables.

 The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigating pesticide contamination in soft drinks and beverages tabled its final report in Parliament, corroborating the findings of the Centre for Science & Environment (CSE) that leading Coca-Cola and Pepsi brands contained hazardous pesticides.
 The Central Food Laboratory (CFL) at Mysore and Kolkata, which independently analysed the same 12 brands in which CSE had found pesticide residues, detected the presence of organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides.
 �CSE stands corroborated on its finding of pesticide residues but their quantities vary widely.
 But these variations can be attributed to a host of factors like manufacturing locations, date of manufacture and storage conditions,� said the report.
 It also praised the NGO for its whistleblowing act.
 CFL Mysore detected 0.00132 mg of organochlorine pesticide per litre in Coca-Cola and 0.000008 mg per litre in Pepsi.
 This was much lower than .0044 mg/l of the same compounds detected by CSE in Coke and 0.0035 mg/l in Pepsi.
 CSE�s Sunita Narain said she was thrilled by the JPC report as it was a vindication of the NGO�s stand.
 �The committee has endorsed the concerns of public health in the country and it puts to rest the entire cola companies versus CSE debate,� she added.
 Both the cola companies in question claimed that they haven�t been pulled in by the report.
 �We are reviewing the JPC report.
 We share the government�s interest in protecting consumer health which is why we have always produced beverages that are made according to the same high quality standards we use around the world.
 We are confident that the safety of Indian consumers can be ensured by establishing scientific, health-based safety standards that are consistent with internationally accepted norms,� said an official statement from Pepsi Foods India.
 �Our products made in India are safe and world-class.
 We follow one quality system across the world.
 Our products already meet the science-based norms recommended by JPC.
 We look forward to the government finalising the scientific norms for the country,� said Sunil Gupta, VP (corporate affairs), Coca-Cola India.
 The report said that the zero pesticide norms that apply in Europe need not be the standard in India but felt that the MNC cola companies being the two biggest players in the market, must set an example.
 The JPC report also dismissed the argument that the residues could be because of the sugar used and not the water.
 �The soft drinks companies are already purifying sugar syrup with hot carbon treatment process, which reduces pesticide residues to below detectable levels.
 Therefore sugar cannot be the only source of contamination,� it said.
 The cola companies together with industry lobbies had contended that fruit juices also be governed by the same guidelines as carbonated drinks.
 But the committee said that the two categories cannot be clubbed.
 Moreover, fruit juices are a multi-component system where water is an ingredient but not the main ingredient, unlike soft drinks which contain more than 80 per cent water.
 The apple industry faces a potential public-relations headache in the wake of federal testing that found pesticide residues in 98% of America's second-most-popular fresh fruit, the highest rate among the produce screened by the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture in a yearly survey.
 In the vast majority of cases, residues of the 48 different pesticides the USDA found in its sampling of apples�the nation's most widely consumed fresh fruit after bananas�were within amounts that federal regulators consider safe to eat.
 But the department's study has prompted the Environmental Working Group, a Washington-based consumer-advocacy group, to put conventionally raised apples at the top of its latest "Dirty Dozen" list.
 That list, which identifies the fruits and vegetables the group says are the most contaminated with farm chemicals, is slated to be released Monday.
 The USDA also found pesticide residue on more than 90% of samples of six other types of produce:
 grapes, strawberries, cilantro, potatoes, oranges and spinach.
 Before testing, laboratory workers washed the samples under cold water for 10 seconds to mimic the way consumers were expected to handle the foods at home.
 The Environmental Working Group, which says it uses USDA and other government data to compile its lists, isn't advising people to stop eating those foods.
 "The health benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables outweigh the risks of pesticide exposure," said Sonya Lunder, a senior analyst at the group.
 Still, the group's guidance can steer consumers away from crops that rely on insecticides, fungicides and weed killers.
 Produce farmers, including apple producers, have long criticized its lists, saying they stir needless doubts about foods that comply with federal standards and whose growers are doing nothing improper.
 For shoppers who can't or don't want to pay the premium prices charged for organic produce, the group publishes a list of the conventional crops it says offer the lowest exposure to pesticides.
 The revised "Clean 15" list, which it is also issuing Monday, is topped by onions, sweet corn, pineapples and avocados.
 Congress ordered the USDA to survey the levels of pesticide in food annually following the 1989 Alar controversy involving apples.
 Apple sales sank after a broadcast on the CBS news-magazine program "60 Minutes" linked Alar to health risks, and the pesticide was banned from use on food.
 In years when the USDA has included apples in its surveys, which began in 1991, pesticide residues have been found in a high percentage of the samples.
 Conventional growers use chemicals extensively in their orchards to ward off blemishes that can hurt the appearance, and thus the value, of their crop.
 Fungicides, meanwhile, are routinely applied to apples because the fruit is often stored for several months before reaching consumers.
 The U.S.
 Apple Association, which represents the $2.2 billion industry, has long complained about the "Dirty Dozen" list, which ranked apples No.
 4 last year and celery as No.
  "It's a headache.
 �It implies that something terrible is going on," said Mark Seetin, the trade group's director of regulatory affairs.
 "But growers are doing nothing illegal.
 They're just trying to keep their apples fresh and nutritious." nutritious."
 The Environmental Protection Agency uses the USDA survey to help calculate the amount of pesticides in the American diet which, in turn, guides the federal government's decisions about whether and how farmers can use these chemicals.
 Excessive exposure to pesticides can cause health problems, such as an increased risk of cancer.
 The USDA said that just 3% of all of the samples of produce, beef and rice it analyzed in its most recent survey, which was made public in late May and based on samples collected in 2009, contained either unapproved pesticide or an improper amount of pesticide.
 "The data we collect confirms that consumers can assume that residues, for the most part, fall within the EPA's tolerance level for safe food," said Deputy Agriculture Secretary Kathleen Merrigan.
 The department found five unapproved pesticides in apples, which Mr. Seetin of the U.S.
 Apple Association said was probably due to chemicals drifting on the wind from orchards growing other kinds of fruit on which those pesticides are approved for use.
 That's a smaller number of unapproved pesticides than the agency detected in crops such as cucumbers, green onions and spinach.
 According to an analysis of the data by the Environmental Working Group, a total of 33 unapproved pesticides were detected on 44% of the cilantro samples.
 Much of conventional agricultural is dependent on synthetic chemicals, both to fight off insects and to prevent weeds from taking sunlight, water and fertilizer away from crops.
 The pesticide trade group CropLife America figures that crop losses would double without these chemicals, raising food costs.
 Tracking the prevalence of pesticide residue in the food supply over time is difficult, in part because the USDA changes the crops it screens from year to year.
 In its latest study, 57.4% of 11,811 samples of 21 different types of food had pesticide residue, the vast majority at levels the government considers safe to consume.
 DDT continues to show up in food even though it was banned in the U.S.in 1972.
 The insecticide persists for a long time in soil, getting into grass eaten by cattle or the bottoms of ponds.
 Minuscule amounts of one degraded form of DDT was found by the USDA in 65% of the survey's catfish samples and 24% of its samples of beef fat, albeit at levels below those considered unsafe by regulators.
 The benefits of eating organic food go straight to the farm, where no pesticides and chemical fertilizers are used to grow the organic produce shipped to grocers.
 That means workers and farm neighbors aren't exposed to potentially harmful chemicals, it means less fossil fuel converted into fertilizers and it means healthier soil that should sustain crops for generations to come.
 For individuals, organic food also has benefits.
 Eating organic means avoiding the pesticide residue left on foods, and it may even mean more nutritious varietals, though research into that subject has yielded mixed results.
 While there are few if any proven health impacts from consuming trace quantities of pesticides on foods, a growing number of people take the precaution of avoiding exposure just in case, particularly in the cases of pregnant women (growing babies are exposed to most of the chemicals that mom consume) and the parents of young children.
 But organic food can cost more, meaning many families are loathe to shell out the extra cash for organic produce on every shopping trip.
 That's what makes the Environmental Working Group's annual list of the dirty dozen foods so useful.
 The group analyzes Department of Agriculture data about pesticide residue and ranks foods based on how much or little pesticide residue they have.
 The group estimates that individuals can reduce their exposure by 80% if they switch to organic when buying these 12 foods.
 The USDA and farm and food industry representatives are quick to remind consumers that the government sets allowable pesticide residue limits it deems safe, and the produce for sale in your grocery store should meet those standards.
 Watchdogs like Environmental Working Group see those limits as too liberal, and see the dirty dozen list as a teaching tool to educate consumers about the benefits of organic food.
 Even Environmental Working Group says that the benefits of eating fresh fruits and vegetables outweighs the known risks of consuming pesticide residue.
 At TheDailyGreen.com, we always favor educating consumers so that we can make the decision for ourselves.
  The 2011 dirty dozen list reflects testing data from the 2010 harvest, and because some pesticide use is dependent on weather conditions that vary by farm, it may not reflect the pesticide residue on produce in your grocery store.
 That's why we include not only those fruits and vegetables on Environmental Working Group's current list, but produce that has made the list in the past, as well as information about pesticides used to produce meat, dairy and some other favorite foods that aren't on Environmental Working Group's latest dirty dozen list.
 In general, tree fruits, berries, leafy greens dominate the list.
 Since the USDA tests produce after a typical household preparation, fruits and vegetables with thick skins that are removed before eating (melons, avocado, corn, etc.) tend to have the lowest amounts of pesticide residue.
 If you don't see a favorite food here, check Whats On My Food, a project of the Pesticide Action Network that makes the same USDA pesticide residue testing data available in an easy-to-use database.
  Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has a state of the art laboratory in the Department of Entomology having all sophisticated equipment and modern instruments required for pesticide analysis and toxicological studies.
 The laboratory has modern instruments such as GLC, GC-MS, HPLC, HPTLC, LCMS/MS apart from other equipments used in pesticide residue analysis.
 The laboratory has been approved for accreditation by the National Accreditation Board for Laboratories (NABL), Department of Science and Technology, Govt.of India, New Delhi.
 With this recognition, the laboratory�s status has further enhanced enhanced
 The laboratory has the distinction of being associated with various research projects funded by International and National agencies like UNDP, FAO, WHO, ICAR, ICMR, DGHS and State Govt.
 Recently, the Punjab Govt. granted a sum of Rs. 5.0 crores to the laboratory to establish as a �Centre of Excellence in Pesticide Residue Analysis�.
 According to Dr. T.P. Rajendran, Assistant Director General (PP), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the final NABL assessment of PAU was conducted by NABL during 3-4 July and that the NABL audit team has recommended the lab for its accreditation.
 He said that the NABL will send the accreditation certificate to the laboratory shortly.
 He has congratulated Dr. Manjit Singh Kang, Vice Chancellor PAU, for this recognition.
 Dr. Kang expressed that the Pesticide Residue Lab has been a land mark facility at PAU that is now recognized as the "Referral Lab" for agrochemical residue analyses at the national level.
 He congratulated the scientists involved in the laboratory for this achievement and highlighted that the lab would be further strengthened.
 Giving details, the laboratory Incharge, Dr. Balwinder Singh stated that the mandate of the laboratory is to study pesticide residues in food, feed and environmental samples, metabolism of pesticides in plants, insects and soil and mechanism of insecticide resistance to insecticides.
 The laboratory is acting as a leader in standardization of analytical methodology for newer pesticides; he said adding that it provides analysis facilities to faculty members who are to present their research proposals for approval from the Research Evaluation Committee (REC) of PAU for recommendation to the farming community.
 The Head, Department of Entomology, Dr. A.K.Dhawan elaborated that at present two mega research projects are in operation in this laboratory.
 Of these, a project, �All India Network Project on Pesticide Residues� funded by ICAR is in operation since 1984.
 Under this project, supervised field trials are carried out to study the persistence of pesticides on different crops.
 Based on the data obtained, waiting periods are worked out for the safety of consumers.
 The data of these trials are also useful for the national regulatory authorities to take appropriate decisions regarding safe use of pesticides in the country, said Dr. Dhawan.
 The second project, �Monitoring of Pesticide Residues at National Level� is funded by the Department of Agriculture and Cooperate, Ministry of Agriculture, Govt. of India.
 The main aim of the project is to assess the frequency and magnitude of pesticide residues in food commodities being sold in the market.
 The major objective of the project is to determine the source of contamination of the commodity with harmful pesticides in case the residue in higher magnitude is encountered.
 This helps to initiate efforts to minimize this source of contamination.
 The laboratory is acting as a core laboratory under this project, said Dr. Dhawan.
 Dr. K. K. Sharma, Network Coordinator, All India Network Project on Pesticide Residues said that the laboratory is playing a useful role at the national level.
 A report on analysis of pesticide residues in soft drinks was conducted by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), an NGO based in Delhi which stated presence of pesticides in the samples of 12 soft drinks brands procured by it from open market in Delhi.
 A serious concern was raised over the finding of pesticide residues in soft drinks.
 A Committee of 15 members of Parliament was constituted as Joint Committee on Pesticide Residues in and safety standards for soft drinks, fruit juices and other beverages.
 The major ingredient of soft drinks is water which account for 86%-92% of the total soft drink composition.
 Besides water, soft drinks contain sugar varying from 5 to 10%, carbon dioxide, acid like citric acid, phosphoric acid and malic acid which are added in the concentrate.
 It has been stated that there is possibility of pesticides entering into the beverages through sugar.
 A need was felt to fix the MRL�s of pesticides used on sugar.
 Generally, MRL�s are fixed based on the residue data generated under supervised trials generated under different agro climatic conditions.
 MRL�s are also fixed based on the monitoring data.
 Fixation of Maximum Residue Limit of different pesticides in sugar based on monitoring data/ with Limits of quantitation(LOQ).
 Standardization of different analytical grade pesticides in Gas-Chromatograph equipped with Electron Capture Detector and Nitrogen Phosphorus Detector Detector
 The analytical grade pesticides under monitoring study were purchased from USA made of Accu Standard along with the purity certificate and the purity percentage is listed below:
 10 mg of each individual pesticide standard was taken in a 100 ml volumetric flask and dissolve in hexane, acetone or methanol depending upon each individual compounds solubility.
 Thus, 100 PPM stock solution of each individual pesticide standard was prepared.
 Working standard of individual pesticide:
 1-10 PPM working standard solution was prepared using dilution technique.
 Depending upon character, retention time and sensitivity of each compound of instrument, mixed standard solutions was prepared at different concentration.
 Thus, two mixtures were prepared containing organo-phosphorus, and triazine herbicides ( 0.01- 5.0 ppm) for analysis in GC-NPD, organocarbamates (0.1 � 1.0 ppm) in GC-MS and another mixture was prepared containing lindane, fipronil, cypermethrin ( 1ppb- 1ppm) for analysis in GC-ECD.
 Only Imidacloprid (0.1ppm - 5.0ppm) was prepared for analysis in HPLC.
 However, all these pesticides were also standardized in Gas-Chromatography- Mass Spectrometer.
 Standardization of mixed standard solutions using Multi-residue method in Gas Chromatograph equipped with Electron Capture Detector and Nitrogen Phosphorus Detector and Gas Chromatograph � Mass Spectrometer Spectrometer
 The mixed standard solutions were injected into gas chromatograph and retention times of all the pesticides were verified from the records of individual pesticide retention time.
 Gas Chromatographic/HPLC/GC-MS parameters for determining pesticides using Multi-residue method method
 Gas Chromatographic Parameters For Multiresidues Of Organophosphorus (dichlorovos, monocrotofos, phorate, chloropyrifos and quinalfos) insecticides and two triazine (atrazine and metribuzin) herbicides herbicides
 A recovery experiment was conducted in order to standardize the efficiency of the proposed methodology.
 After determination of Limit of detection (LOD) of individual pesticides, the sugar samples (20g, 50g and 100g) was fortified with mixture of pesticides in such a way so that double the concentration of LOD is maintained irrespective of sugar weight and kept for an hour.
 The sample was dissolved with 50 ml HPLC grade water using magnetic stirrer for about 10 minutes.
 Then it was transferred to 1 lt.
 separatory funnel and partitioned with 50 ml HPLC grade hexane:
 dichloromethane (1:1) for two times followed by HPLC ethyl acetate (50 ml x 2).
 The organic layer was passed over anhydrous sodium sulfate (activated) and concentrated using rotary vacuum evaporator (~ 40�C).
 The final volume was made up with HPLC hexane (1 ml) for estimation of organophosphorus, carbamate and herbicides.
 For organochlorine and synthetic pyrethroid the final volume was 10 ml.
 Sugar sample without fortification was also tested as control sample.
 All the solvents used were also analysed in GC-ECD, NPD, GC-MS and in HPLC.
 The analysis was carried out in three replicates.
 Sugar samples were divided mainly into two categories viz.
 Factory sugar outlet samples and market sugar.
 Factory sugar samples were of mainly Small (S), Medium (M) and Large (L) size.
 A representative and valid sugar samples (2 kg) were collected randomly from different sugar factories of the country.
 For market sugar, representative and valid (1kg) sugar samples were collected randomly from five to six vendors of each market of different geographic locations.
 Collection site of different sugar samples are listed in Table-09 and Table-10.
 Storage condition of samples before analysis analysis
 Sugar samples were extracted immediately after collection as far as practicable.
 Extracts were cleaned up immediately after extraction as far as possible but in some cases the extracts were also stored in the refrigerator to a minimum period of time before final analysis.
 Sugar samples were dissolved in water and partitioned with Hexane :
 Dichloromethane (1:1) followed by further partition with ethyl - acetate and concentrated in rotary vacuum evaporator for final analysis in HPLC and GLC equipped with ECD and NPD and GC-MS.
 Reagents and Apparatus Apparatus
  Individual sugar samples was mixed well and representative 20g sugar was taken in three replicates by quartering technique and was weighed accurate to 0.01g into a 250 ml beaker.
 30 ml HPLC grade water was added and placed on a magnetic stirrer for about 10 minutes, ensuring the sugar samples have completely dissolved in water.
 10 ml of hexane :
 dichloromethane (1:1) was added to the beaker and was transferred to 1 lt.
 separatory funnel.
 The beaker was rinsed with 40 ml hexane :
 dichloromethane (1:1) for several times and this rinse was transferred to the separatory funnel for partitioning.
 Partition was carried out using ten strokes of the separatory funnel.
 The bottom layer was passed through a funnel containing anhydrous sodium sulfate (activated) into a 250 ml pear shaped flask.
 The step was repeated once more.
 The partition was further done in the similar way using HPLC ethyl acetate (50 ml x 2).
 All the organic layer was passed over anhydrous sodium sulfate (activated) and concentrated using rotary vacuum evaporator (~400C) to about 1 ml for estimation of organophosphorus, carbamate and herbicides.
 For organochlorine and synthetic pyrethroid the final volume was 10 ml.
 The method adopted was the partial modification of �Multiresidue Method for the Gas Chromatographic Determination of Pesticides in Honey after Solid Phase Extraction Cleanup� by Christer Jansson, Journal of AOAC International, Vol.
  Final analysis and calculation calculation
  Then 1-2 �l of each cleaned up test samples was injected into the GC- ECD, GC-NPD, GC-MS and HPLC for the respective mixture of pesticides.
 Theresidue was identified by comparing the retention time of sample peaks with that of mixture of standard.
 The amount of residues in ppm (�g/g) was calculated as follows:
 Where, Where,
 A1= Area of sample in the Chromatogram Chromatogram
 A2= Area of standard in the Chromatogram Chromatogram
 V1= Total volume of sample in ml ml
 V2 = Injected volume of the sample in �l �l
 C =Concentration of analytical standard in ng ng
 W = Weight of the sample in gm gm
 Rf = % mean recovery factor factor
   The results of the recovery study revealed that the recovery percentage varied from 71.2-147% in 20g sugar, 61-120% in 50g sugar and 45.0 � 90.0% in 100g sugar with low Relative Standard Deviations indicating the suitability of the method.
 Based on the recovery percentage, the method proposed to carry out the analysis of sugar samples with 20g for best results as well as for easy handling.
 The Results of the recovery experiments are shown in Table 11-14.
  The limit of quantitation of different pesticides based on recovery experiment are as follows:
  Monitoring results of pesticide residues in different sugar samples samples
  Multiresidue method for the determination of pesticides in sugar involves dissolution of sugar in water followed by liquid-liquid partitioning and gas chromatographic determination.
 Thirteen pesticides (lindane, fipronil, cypermethrin, dichlorovos, monocrotofos, phorate, atrazine, metribuzin, chlorpyrifos, quinalfos, carbofuran, carbaryl and imidacloprid) were determined by the method.
 Recovery from sugar (20g), spiked at 0.01-10 �g/g, ranged from 71.2 to 147% with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 1.06 � 3.25%.
 It is a quick and less time consuming method that gives good recoveries of all the thirteen pesticides tested.
 All the 200 sugar samples (factory outlet and market) were analyzed by the proposed methodology and residues were Below Detectable Limit (BDL).
 Pesticide Residues in Food and the Environment Environment
 The Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) (JMPR)
 The Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) has met annually since 1963 to conduct scientific evaluations of pesticide residues in food.
 It provides advice on the acceptable levels of pesticide residues in food moving in international trade.
 The JMPR consists of experts drawn from governments and academic circles.
 They attend as independent internationally-recognized specialists who act in a personal capacity and not as representatives of national governments.
 Contact FAO Pesticide Management to order JMPR and Codex documents.
 The FAO segment of JMPR, the FAO Panel of Experts on Pesticide Residues in Food and the Environment, considers available data on recognized / registered use patterns, fate of residues, animal and plant metabolism data, analytical methodology and residue data developed through supervised trials.
 Based on these data, maximum residue levels are proposed for individual pesticides in individual food and feed items or well-defined groups of commodities.
 The deliberations of the JMPR are summarized in the annual Report of the Meeting.
 The detailed evaluations of the residue (Evaluations Part I) and toxicology data (Evaluations Part II) are also published annually and circulated widely to member governments, international organizations and other interested parties.
 Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues (CCPR) (CCPR)
 The maximum residue levels proposed by the JMPR are considered by the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues (CCPR).
 The CCPR, a subsidiary body of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), is an intergovernmental meeting whose prime objective is to reach agreement between governments on maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides residues in food and feed commodities moving in international trade.
 The MRL proposals are considered by the CCPR as part of eight-step procedure which provides opportunity for discussion and comment by national governments and other interested organizations.
 The CCPR recommends MRLs to the biennial meeting of the CAC, for adoption as Codex maximum residue limits (CXLs).
 Parents urged to wash fruits and vegetables before eating after study finds commonly used pesticides may contribute to ADHD in children children
 Children exposed to organophosphate pesticide residues found in fruit are at increased risk of developing Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), according to a US study.
 Scientists from the University of Montreal and Harvard University measured pesticide levels in the urine of 1,139 children, aged 8-15, 119 of whom had ADHD.
 They found those with higher amounts of pesticide residue were twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disorder compared to children with undetectable levels.
 Previous studies have focused on populations with high levels of exposure, such as agricultural workers, but this is the first to suggest a risk to the general population from low-level exposure to pesticide residues.
 'A key point of our paper is that it was among a generally representative sample of the US, so these kids had lower exposure levels than what one might find among those at high risk from exposure (such as those using sheep dips),' said co-author Marc Weisskopf.
  The study said children in particular were considered to be at greater risk from organophosphate toxicity because the developing brain is more susceptible to neurotoxicants and the dose of pesticides per body weight is likely to be larger for them.
 The main source of exposure for infants and children is diet.
 The US Pesticide Residue Program Report 2008 found detectable concentrations of the organophosphopate malathion, an insecticide, in 28 per cent of frozen blueberry, 25 per cent of fresh strawberry and 19 per cent of celery samples.
 In the UK, surveys from the Pesticides Residue Committee have found residues of four organophosphorus pesticides in peppers and residues of malathion in pears, grapes, grapefruit and citrus fruits.
 The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also said drinking water and residential pesticide use are potential sources of exposure.
 Previous research has shown that exposure to some organophosphate compounds cause hyperactivity and cognitive deficits in animals, but this study is one of the first to find that exposure may also have similar effects on the developing neurological systems of children.
 'What is really needed is a prospective study, where mothers are enrolled when pregnant and measurements of organophosphate exposure taken over the course of the child's life (and during the mother's pregnancy), and relating those to the likelihood of subsequent development of ADHD.
 Our study measured exposure and ADHD at the same time,' said Weisskopf.
 Pesticides enter surface and ground water primarily as runoff from crops and are most prevalent in agricultural areas.
 Pesticides are also used on golf courses, forested areas, along roadsides, and in suburban and urban landscape areas.
 Since World War II herbicide and insecticide application to crops has grown to an estimated 660 million pounds of active ingredient in 1993 (1).
 Without proper safeguards pesticides have the potential to seriously threaten many groundwater supplies in the United States.
 Approximately 50% of the U.S.
 population obtains its drinking water from groundwater sources and as much as 95% of the population in agricultural areas uses groundwater as its source of drinking water.
 'Pesticide' is a general term for substances which are used to poison pests (weeds, insects, molds, rodents, etc.).
 The pesticides most acutely dangerous to man are insecticides and rodenticides, although pound for pound, herbicides are the most widely used type of pesticide(2).
 Not every pesticide is acutely toxic to humans or other non-target species.
 On a national scale less than 2% of wells sampled in multi-state studies were found with pesticide concentrations above the established Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) (3).
 Due to repeated detection of various pesticides in U.S. wells, the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently proposed a State Management Program (SMP), which would control or ban pesticides with the greatest potential to contaminate groundwater(4).
 Five pesticides were initially selected due to the frequency of their occurrence:
 alachlor, atrazine, cyanazine, metolachlor, and simazine.
 According to the EPA they all have been detected in many states, and have the potential to reach levels which exceed health based standards.
 They are all associated with serious health effects including cancer.
 The five selected pesticides are herbicides which are used to control broadleaf weeds and grasses.
 The EPA estimates between 200 and 250 million pounds of these herbicides are applied annually in the U.S.
 Atrazine, simazine, and cyanazine are applied to agricultural land before and after planting.
 Alachlor and metolachlor are applied to soil prior to plant growth (pre-emergent).
 There are several factors which influence a pesticides' potential to contaminate water:
 The ability of the pesticide to dissolve in water (solubility).
 Environmental factors, such as, soil, weather, season, and distance to water sources sources
 Application methods and other practices associated with the pesticide use.
 Groundwater contamination is higher when there is no crop or a young crop.
 A large actively growing crop has the ability to reduce pesticide concentration through a variety of mechanisms (5):
 Larger plants consume more water from the soil and therefore reduce the ability of a pesticide to migrate through the soil and enter streams or groundwater.
 Larger plants can collect precipitation which prevents pooling of water and run-off from the area area
 Root zones enrich the microbial community of the soil which then enhances the biodegradation of the pesticide by bacteria.
 The Safe Drinking Water Act sets standards for drinking water and mandates the Environmental Protection Agency set Maximum Contamination Levels (MCLs) for a number of pesticides in public water supplies.
 Private water supplies are not monitored or regulated by this Act.
 Since pesticides are most prevalent in agricultural areas where most residents obtain their drinking water from private sources, it is up to the consumer or well owner to monitor contaminant levels.
 Testing and treatment options are available to the public.
 If you suspect contamination or if a neighbor has experienced contamination contact your health department.
 Packaged drinking water or natural mineral water is everywhere.
 It is now available in pouches, cups, bottles and bulky transparent jars.
 It is sipped in clubs, malls and fitness centres; glugged after a walk, jog or trek; sold on railway platforms and bus terminals, or pressed through car windows during traffic jams.
 Stashed in paan-shops, vendor stalls, department stores and supermarkets, bottled water has made its way into offices, restaurants, hotels and cinemas.
 Turns out that bottled water, the fastest growing segment in the beverage industry, actually contains deadly pesticide residues.
 Here's the whole toxic truth truth
 There was a time in the recently liberalised past when people didn't quite know how to refer to a new product called drinking water.
 They would say 'bottled water' and 'mineral water' to freely refer to one or the other kind of water, perhaps meaning the same one.
 It used to be confusing.
 People were not used to drinking water that had to be bought.
 People were getting used to paying money to drink water.
 Paying more money for their water than they did for milk everyday.
 Now India is wholeheartedly disinvesting...er, further liberalising.
 Now, people don't say 'bottled water' or 'mineral water'.
 These distinctions have become superfluous.
 Now, people simply ask for 'water'.
 Clean spring water, in other words.
 Now, these terms have become completely fused, incorporated, into people's vocabulary and lives.
 Packaged drinking water or natural mineral water are everywhere.
 They are available in pouches, cups, bottles and bulky transparent jars.
 They are sipped in clubs, malls and fitness centres; glugged after a walk, jog or trek; hunted for in railway stations and bus termini, or hurled in a traffic jam.
 People pick bottled waters from paan-shops, vendor stalls, department stores and supermarkets.
 Office architecture includes them, and ice-cream parlours, cafes, restaurants and hotels and cinemas always keep a stock.
 How then should one react if told that this bottled water, supposedly cleaned for consumption, could contain deadly pesticide residues?
 One should react with disbelief and horror.
 Well, go ahead and do exactly that.
 For bottled water does contain pesticide residues.
 All kinds of bottled water, whether national (like Bisleri), or multinational (like Kinley).
 In most, the pesticide residues are above what would be acceptable limits.
 Are citizens being fooled into thinking that their bottled water, sold by companies as the healthy and hygenic drink, is pure and drinkable?
 34 bottles bottles
 Between July and December 2002, the Pollution Monitoring Laboratory (pml) of the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (cse) analysed 17 different brands of pdw and pnmw commonly sold in areas that fall within the national capital region of Delhi.
 The pml randomly bought two bottles of each of these brands from colonies and shopping areas such as Mayur Vihar, Defence Colony, Khan Market, ina Market, Green Park, Lodhi Road and Mathura Road in New Delhi, and from adjoining areas such as Noida, Ghaziabad and Meerut (in Uttar Pradesh state) and Gurgaon (in Haryana state).
 The 34 bottles of pwd/pnmw so collected included a host of not-so-popular brands - Volga, Prime, Paras among others - and also the top five brands in the packaged water segment of the beverage market:
 Bisleri, manufactured by the Parle group; Bailley, also manufactured by Parle; Pure Life, a Nestle product; Aquafina, by Pepsico; and Kinley, from Coca Cola.
 Care was taken to ensure that no two bottles of the same brand were bought from the same area.
 Minscot, a brand popular brand in adjoining Gurgoan was also included, as was Aquaplus, sold mainly at railway stations.
 Once the 34 'samples' were procured, the pml began its analysis.
 The samples were tested to see if they contained pesticides.
 The tests were for two kinds of pesticides:
 organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides.
 The pml tested the samples for 12 organochlorines, and 8 organophosphorus pesticides - covering the spectrum of pesticides most used in India.
 Testing method method
 The pml tested the 34 samples with a widely and internationa-lly used methodology, approved by the United States Environment Protection Agency (usepa) for pesticide detection in drinking water.
 chlorpyrifos:
 It is one of the most widely applied insecticides in homes or restaurants, against cockroaches or termites.
 Chlorpyrifos was detected in 28 out of the 34 samples.
 This extremely toxic chemical was found in quantities exceeding the maximum permissible limits by huge margins - on an average of all samples, it exceeded the eec standard by 49 times.
 For instance, in No 1 McDowell - I (0.037 mg/l) it was 370 times more than the eec permissible limit for a particular pesticide.
 Bisleri (109 times), Kinley of Coca Cola (109 times) and Aquafina of Pepsi was 23 times higher than the eec permissible limit for an individual pesticide.
 Chlorphyrifos is a suspected neuroteratogen - an agent that causes malformations in foetuses.
 The tests detected residues of other pesticides as well.
 Organochlorines such as ddd and dde - both the result of the metabolic conversion of ddt - in 1 and 10 samples respectively; b-endosulphan, a broad spectrum insecticide, in 3 samples, and organophosphorus Dimethoate in 1 sample.
 How the brands fared fared
 What the pml test found was:
 � Packaged natural mineral water brands Evian (imported from France) and Himalayan and Catch, manufactured in relatively clean and less pesticide consuming Himachal Pradesh, were the top three brands in terms of total pesticide content.
 But even then, only in Evian did the lab find nothing.
 Himalayan and Catch had respectively 1 and 3 pesticide residues above the eec standards.
 � The top seller, Bisleri, was the third worst brand out of the total of 17 brands checked - its concentration levels were 79 times higher than the levels stipulated according to drinking water eec limits for total pesticides pesticides
 � Its competitor, Kinley, had concentration levels 14.6 times higher than the maximum residue standards standards
 � The prize went to Aquaplus - manufactured in Burari area of northwest Delhi and most favoured by the Indian Railways.
 This brand was the lethal cocktail - crossing the maximum pesticide limit by 104 times times
 � The story is not healthy:
 on an average, in all the samples of all the 17 brands, the total pesticides were found to be 36.4 times higher than the stipulated levels.
 The test of the cse laboratory clearly revealed that each sample contained multiple residues of pesticides.
 In other words, each bottle of clean water was also a cocktail of tiny amounts of organochlorine and organophos--phorus pesticides.
 A potently disturbing result.
 A patently horrific find.

  The 1970 JMPR (FAO/WHO 1971) recommended practical residue limits of 0.02 mg/kg in milk and milk products (fat basis), 1 mg/kg in fat of poultry, and 0.2 mg/kg in eggs (shell free).
 The 1974 Meeting of the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues (CCPR) referred to the 1974 Joint Meeting a question (Alinorm 74/24, para.
 101) as to whether the proposed residue limits for poultry and eggs were too high, and requested governments to provide data on residue levels in eggs and poultry.
 In addition, the CCPR requested the Joint Meeting to make a proposal for a practical residue limit in meat.
  The Netherlands was the only government responding to the request for data.
 The information was in the form of a summary of Dutch surveys for organochlorine pesticides for the periods 1967-1969 and 1972-1973.
 Of 422 samples of eggs and egg products and 280 samples of poultry tissues examined in the two surveys, no endrin was detected by methods sensitive to 0.01 mg/kg.
 The 1974 Joint Meeting re-examined the 1970 JMPR evaluation and the data upon which it was based.
 The 1970 review adopted an empirical approach in which analyses of animal feed products used in supervised trials were related to controlled feeding studies to establish ratios between intake and storage.
 Insofar as the accuracy of the data available at the time of the 1970 evaluation can be accepted, the practical residue limits recommended by the Joint Meeting at that time are valid.
 The rationale leading to the practical residue limit (PRL) for poultry fat and eggs was based on a ratio of 5 for residues in fat to residues in feed, and a ratio of 0.7 in eggs.
  The 1970 JMPR cited studies showing residues in rice bran ranging from <0.01 to 2.3 mg/kg with a mean of 0.35 mg/kg as a source of residues in poultry and eggs.
 The proposed limit of 1 mg/kg in poultry fat is thus based on a maximum limit of 1 mg/kg in rice bran contributing 0.2 mg/kg to the total diet (at 20% of diet).
 The 1970 JMPR did not include calculations for residues in eggs or poultry which might be derived from cottonseed meal.
 However, residues from that source would be lower than those derived from the bran.
 Evaluation of residue data in meat meat
 The dietary intake of endrin in meat animals must be estimated from those crops with recommended Codex tolerances which are fed directly or in the form of by-products.
 It should be noted that the recommended tolerance level on the commodity does not necessarily reflect the residue levels in the feed by-products (see table 1).
 Little information is available on the present extent of endrin use world-wide or on the extent to which the above feed items are utilized in various countries.
 Also because some of the items may replace others, it is difficult to make a realistic estimate of the total level in the animal diet.
 Sufficient data were available to estimate the relationship between endrin intake in meat animals and storage in body fat.
 The average ratio of endrin in body fat to endrin in the diet is 0.45 for cattle and sheep.
 This is in marked contrast to the storage ratio for poultry which is about 5.6.
 The reason for the difference is not apparent but may be associated with the methods of analysis used in the earlier work on cattle and sheep (phenyl azide colorimetric method).
 In any event, it is clear that endrin does not accumulate in body fat to the extent that dieldrin does, nor is it retained as long in the body when the pesticide is removed from the diet.
 The Netherlands has submitted data from a survey on domestic and imported beef, pork, mutton and horse meat products extending from 1969 to the present.
 No endrin was found (<0.05 mg/kg) in any sample.
 No other governments responded to the CCPR request for data.
 However, market basket surveys in the US and the UK are available and have not shown significant residues of endrin in meat or dairy products.
  The 1974 CCPR also requested the Joint Meeting to propose a PRL for endrin in meat.
 The 1970 JMPR followed a rationale in which residues in poultry feed items resulting from good agricultural practices in various countries were related to controlled endrin feeding experiments with poultry.
 The Joint Meeting concludes from re-examination of the data that the recommended figures of 1 mg/kg in poultry fat and 0.2 mg/kg in eggs are valid.
 The discrepancy between the predicted residues based on supervised trials and the levels actually occurring in European countries is probably due to curtailed use of endrin in the western world.
 The Joint Meeting notes that survey data on endrin residues in meat are not available from India, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia or South America, the countries where residues were found in animal feed products from agricultural uses.
 The Joint Meeting recognizes the desirability of reducing endrin tolerances whenever possible but is unable to recommend lower practical residue limits for endrin in poultry fat and eggs on the basis of the available information.
 The Joint Meeting has evaluated the need for a PRL in meat.
 Information is fragmentary on world-wide animal feeding practices but the Meeting concluded that a PRL of 0.1 mg/kg (fat basis) would be appropriate for endrin in meat and meat by-products.
 This is consistent with data from controlled feeding studies which show that the storage ratio for endrin in the fat of meat animals is about one tenth of that in poultry.
  The following additional practical residue limit is recommended.
 MILAN (Reuters) - Pesticide residues found in food in the European Union fell in 2009 compared with 2008 thanks to tightening of safety rules and changes in patterns of pesticide use in Europe, EU's food safety agency said on Tuesday.
 Compliance with the legal maximum residue levels (MRLs) for pesticides in food rose to 97.4 percent of the analyzed samples in 2009, up by about one percentage point from 2008, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said.
 Based on current knowledge, long-term exposure to residues detected in major foods that make up the European diet would not raise health concerns, EFSA said.
 Even a level of pesticides in food at a level exceeding the MRLs does not necessarily imply a safety concern, EFSA said in a statement on its annual pesticide residues report for 2009.
 In the EU-coordinated part of the monitoring program, which is run alongside national programs, 61.4 percent of samples were free of measurable pesticide residues.
 The samples that exceeded MRL under the EU-coordinated program fell to 1.4 percent in 2009 from 4.4 percent in 2006, the last time the same food commodities of plant origin were analyzed under the EU-coordinated program, EFSA said.
 The improvement is due partly to the more effective use of legislation that compels producers and other industry players to implement safety systems as well as to changes in the pattern of pesticide use in Europe, EFSA said.
 Harmonization of MRLs, which came into force in September 2008, may have also contributed to the improvement, the Parma-based agency said.
 Risks to consumers from short-term acute exposure to pesticide residues in food are unlikely based even on worst-case scenarios, such as consumption of large portions of a food item containing the highest recorded residue, it said.
 A potential risk could not be ruled out for only 77 samples out of the 10,553 samples taken in the EU-coordinated program.
 MRLs were more often breached in samples from countries outside the European Economic Area (6.9 percent of samples) than in those from the EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, (1.5 percent of samples), EFSA said.
 Reporting countries, which included all EU member states as well as Iceland and Norway, analyzed nearly 68,000 samples of food commodities for 834 pesticides for the report.
 The types of food commodities analyzed rose to about 300 in 2009 from just under 200 in 2008, EFSA said.

 The use of pesticides is strictly controlled in the United States.
 Every chemical, which has possible use as a pesticide, is closely tested and reviewed before it is marketed.
 The laws controlling the use of pesticides on food or feed crops are more strict.
 The amount of pesticide remaining on the crop at harvest is carefully regulated.

 Learn what information is important in registering a pesticide.
 Pesticide Residues Residues
 The pesticide which is on the leaves, skin, or other surface right after application is the deposit.
 Sometimes the deposit can be easily seen, as with many dusts or wettable powders.
 At other times it cannot be seen with the naked eye.
 If the pesticide deposit remains on the surface for a period of time, it is called a residue.
 Some pesticides leave little or no residue.
 Heat, light, moisture, soil organisms, and other chemical reactions in the environment quickly break them down.
 Other pesticides are not quickly broken down.
 They leave a residue on the crop or in the environment for weeks, months, or years.
 Depending on how and where it is used, each pesticide will vary in how long a residue remains on the crop or surface.
 Therefore, information on residues is required on each crop the pesticide is applied to.
 Unfortunately, a pesticide may drift over from a nearby field and leave a residue on a crop or surface.
 A long-lasting residue may be desirable because the pesticide is effective for a longer period of time.
 It need not be applied as often and thus may be cheaper to use.
 However, long-lasting residues are not always desirable.
 The chemicals may remain on food or feed and be hazardous to those eating them.
 The residues may remain in the soil to interfere with crops that are planted at a later date.
 Or they may remain on the surface and injure workers or others who reenter the treated area.
 Clearly it is important to know what residue, if any, remains after a period of time.
 Food, in fact, may have no residue because it may never have been treated, or it was treated at less than the maximum dose and the residues may have degraded.
 Pesticide Tolerances Tolerances
 Many times residues remain on food or feed crops at harvest time.
 Since these crops are to be eaten, safe amounts of residues must be established.
 The maximum amount of residue, which may legally remain, on a harvested crop is called a tolerance.
 Federal law requires that a tolerance be set for every food or feed use of each pesticide before it is registered.
 The tolerances vary from crop to crop depending on the many safety factors involved.
 If the residue exceeds the set tolerance, the crop may not be marketed or sold.
 It is subject to condemnation and seizure by federal or state regulatory agencies.
 How Tolerances Are Set.
 Much information is gathered and studied before a tolerance is set.
 Studies on test animals are done to determine the acute and chronic toxicity of the chemical.
 Toxicity to fish, birds, and mammals is also determined.
 The length of time the pesticide remains in the environment is measured.
 Possible long-term effects such as buildup in animals or in the environment are studied.
 All these factors (and others) are taken into account before setting a tolerance.
 The tolerance is usually set at least 100 times smaller than the highest dose, which has no effect in test animals.
 For example, 200 parts per million of pesticide A have no effect on test animals.
 Then the tolerance for pesticide A on any food or feed crop could be no higher than 2 parts per million (ppm).
 The "safety factor" is 100 times.
 The tolerances for pesticide A may not be as high as 2 ppm.
 Field tests may show that acceptable pest control is achieved using doses and methods that result in a residue much less than 2 ppm.
 Then the tolerance would be set at 1 ppm.
 [The tolerance is stated in parts per million (ppm) by weight.
 That is, one part of pesticide to one million parts of crop or meat.] meat.]
 Negligible Residue Tolerances.
 A residue may be on a food or feed crop even though no pesticide was ever directly applied to it.
 These residues result from indirect contact with the chemical.
 The residue may be found, for example, in livestock which have eaten sprayed forage and grass.
 Edible meat of livestock containing residues must have a negligible residue tolerance.
 Or when a herbicide is applied before a crop emerges, a residue may be left in the soil.
 As the crop grows it may pick up a small amount of the herbicide.
 If the residue is still in the crop at harvest, a negligible residue tolerance must be set.
 A negligible residue tolerance (usually just "negligible residue") is set when a very small residue is likely to be on food or feed at harvest.
 Negligible means small or minor.
 The negligible residue is usually one tenth (0.1) of a part per million or less.
 It is far below any toxic level.
 Finite Tolerances.
 When a pesticide will be applied directly on a food or feed crop and animal, a finite tolerance is set.
 A finite tolerance (often just "tolerance") is usually larger than a negligible residue.
 However, it is still well below possible toxic levels.
 To be eaten, a tolerance must have been set, unless it is exempt from tolerance.
 Days to Harvest Harvest
 Most pesticides break down in the environment.
 As they break down, the residue on the crop or animal becomes smaller.
 Therefore, the residues remaining at harvest depend on how long before harvest the pesticide is applied.
 "Days to Harvest" is the least number of days between the last pesticide application and the harvest day.
 ("Days to Slaughter" is used with livestock.) Both are listed on the label.
 For example, when pesticide A is applied on the day of harvest, it leaves a residue of 10 ppm.
 However, when it is applied 7 days before harvest, it leaves a residue of only 2 ppm.
 If acceptable pest control is possible by applying 7 days before harvest, EPA will often set the tolerance at 2 ppm and the "Days of Harvest" at 7 days.
 If days to harvest, recommended dosages and other label instructions are followed, the residue on the crop should be under the set tolerance.
 Registration Registration
 Even though a tolerance is set for a pesticide on a specific crop, it still cannot be legally used until registered.
 Every pesticide and every use must be registered federally by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
 EPA reviews all the required information on the pesticide.
 This includes toxicity studies, wildlife and environmental studies, breakdown and residue studies, chemical studies, etc.
 Registration will be granted only if the Administrator finds that the benefits of its use outweigh the risks.
 EPA also reviews and registers all statements which appear on the pesticide label.
 (See Chapter XIV, The Label.) No pesticide may be bought, sold, or used in the United States until it has federal registration for the product, the use, and the label.
 It is up to you, the applicator, to help make sure that all food complies with established tolerances.
 Only you can be sure that no illegal residues remain on food crops.
 Follow label directions carefully.
 Do not be responsible for seizure of your customer's or his neighbor's crop! crop!

 Abstract Abstract
 India is the second largest producer of vegetables after China, and accounts for 13.4% of world production.
 Surveys carried out by institutions spread throughout the country indicate that 50-70% of vegetables are contaminated with insecticide residues.
 Rapid, inexpensive and sensitive methods such as pesticide finger printing technique and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay developed at CFTRI, Mysore, together with GC analysis revealed that in most cases the residue burden was less than the maximum residue limits (MRLs), with some exceptions.
 Frequently DDT and HCH residues were detected.
 Evidence suggests that chemical residues in vegetables are due to pick-up from the contaminated soil by plants and migration to edible parts.
 Bacterial cultures capable of degrading HCH have been isolated at CFTRI and successfully deployed as �Agrocure� to combat HCH residues through accelerated degradation of the chemical in soil.
 Pseudomonas ptm+ strain developed at CFTRI produced an extracellular surfactant, which was exploited as a cleaning agent �Baxeklen� to dislodge pesticide residues in vegetables.
 Bioremediation and biocleaning are the redeeming technologies useful to limit pesticide residues in vegetables.
 Introduction Introduction
 India has a wide variety of climate and soils on which a range of vegetable crops can be grown.
 During the last two decades considerable emphasis has been laid on production of these crops in our country, and vegetable exports have been stepped up (CHADDA, 2000).
 In vegetable production, India is the second largest producer next only to China with an annual production of 81 million t from 5.12 million ha of land (Table I).
 However, the development of the export market is hindered by concerns about chemical residues and inadequate monitoring.
 Post harvest losses are also a problem, related to lack of adequate harvesting equipment, absence of collection centers in major producing areas, as well as suitable containers, commercial storage plants and cold chains.
 Considerable losses also occur during transport mainly due to lack of proper packaging and handling technology.
 Research on post harvest management of fruits and vegetables is being carried out in a number of laboratories spread all over the country as shown in Table II.
 The Pesticide Burden in Vegetables Vegetables
 Pesticide Use Pattern in India India
 India currently uses about 60 000 t of pesticides, a decline of one-third since 5 years ago.
 Worldwide, there has been a 44% increase in the use of herbicides over the past decade, with a concomitant reduction in insecticides by 30%.
 Since insecticides still account for 70% of total pesticide use in India (Table III), it is likely that insecticide residues will continue to be an issue for at least another decade, even if the declining trend in use continues.
 Over the past few years we have been realizing the counterproductive effects of pesticide use, such as pest resistance to farm chemicals.
 In addition, long persistence of some agrochemicals in the environment sets in a series of undesirable effects through contamination of food and feed.
 The 30 million non-target bioforms, so far safe in the cradle of nature, are rocked with threat of extinction.
 Their numbers are reducing.
 Bioaccumulation of pesticides and biomagnification processes have become the weak links in the food chain.
 Notorious Chemicals Chemicals
 Among the pesticides that have acquired notoriety, DDT and BHC (=HCH, =Gammaxane, =Lindane) are particularly important.
 In India DDT and BHC were the two major chemicals used in agriculture and public health programs.
 Although now partially banned, they are still very much in use because of their wide spectrum of activity and ready availability at low cost.
 Our biggest concern is that these molecules are stable in the environment.
 More than 600 000 t of HCH (Hexacholorocyclohexane) and 270 000 t of DDT have been added to the environment since their respective introductions in 1949 and 1952.
 It is suspected that most of our water bodies and soils are contaminated with these chemicals or with their degradation products (KRISHNA MURTHY, 1984).
 DDT persists with a half life of about 10 years, with only minor conversion to p, p' DDT, DDE, TDE, o, p DDT, etc.
 The uptake and accumulation of DDT and its metabolites in different plants and animal species varies considerably.
 Pesticide Monitoring in Market Basket Samples Samples
 Vegetables sold in Mysore market are mainly grown in villages around the city and are harvested and sold fresh.
 As many as 514 samples collected over 4 different seasons were checked for the residue burden, the profile for which is given in Table IV.
 The data clearly indicate the presence of HCH and DDT residues, the 2 major farm chemicals present in the soil that have migrated in to the vegetables.
 HCH contamination ranged from 15 � 70% of the samples, while DDT was found in 11 � 28% (SHARADA, 1988).
 However the concentrations measured varied from traces to about 3ppm (less than the MRL value of 5ppm set by FAO/WHO (1986) and PFA (1954)).
 Similar surveys were carried out in different states of the country (SETH et al.,1988) and residues of varied pesticides were reported as described in Table V.
 In Andhra Pradesh, quite high levels of DDT residues were reported, probably due to intensive application of DDT for vector control under the malaria irradiation program (PARMAR & DUREJA, 1990).
 These results make a strong case for intensifying a pesticide "policing" program through inexpensive methods and the need for control measures to abate pesticide residues in vegetables and other foods.

 A Rapid Method for Pesticide Residue Detection Detection
 A sensitive one-step method has been developed at CFTRI for the ultra-rapid in situ detection of organocholorine insecticide residues in vegetables and fruits (KARANTH et al., 1982b).
 The "Finger Printing Technique" enables the detection of DDT, BHC and Endosulfan in vegetables through the development of green, prussian blue and yellow colors respectively in the sunlight; by gently pressing the vegetable tissues on filter paper impregnated with an o-tolidine solution.
 This method is simple and sensitive (sensitivity 0.3 to 10ppm).
 The entire procedure takes less than one minute and does not require any equipment, clean-up procedure or technical personnel.
 Finger printing techniques have already been proven to be useful tools for assessing on the spot the quality of the farm produce.
 Recent studies have revealed that the finger printing technique has wider applications.
 It is also useful in locating other chlorine containing chemicals such as synthetic pyrethroids, carbamates and organophosphates in vegetable and fruit tissues.
 The method is reliable and reproducible, as the identity of the insecticide residues in vegetables was confirmed by TLC method (KARANTH et al., 1983b).
 ELISA for Pesticides - a Unique Method Method
 Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA), based on an antibody-antigen reaction, has become very useful and popular for the detection of environmentally harmful chemicals such as pesticides.
 Pesticide immuno assays have, in the past two decades, made much progress and appear to be an appropriate technique for the detection of trace quantities of residues usually present in vegetables and fruits (SKERRITT et al., 1998).
 The method involves particular antigen antibody reactions and hence is sensitive and specific.
 It is rapid and could be a particularly good method of choice when a large number of samples have to be analyzed.
 CFTRI was the first institute in India to develop ELISA for pesticides under a joint collaborative international research project with CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation), Canberra from 1993 to 1996 funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) (Project No.
  Prior to that there was no research on the development of the ELISA method for pesticide residue analysis in India.
  Immunoassays apply antibodies that have been prepared in rabbits, mice or sheep to a particular pesticide or family of pesticides (KARANTH et al., 1999a).
 The pesticide molecules are too small to elicit an immune response, and so must be conjugated to a large carrier molecule, usually a protein.
 Bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, human serum albumin, keyhole limpet haemocyanin are some of the frequently used immunogenic carrier proteins.
 The pesticide or a precursor or a metabolite having a functional group such as - OH, -SH, -COOH or -NH2 is useful for conjugation with the carrier.
 However, frequently a derivative of the pesticide, possessing such a functionality must first be synthesized before conjugation can be effected.
 If an analogue is used, it must retain all the characteristic features of the pesticide, but contain a new chemical group in its structure that can act as a handle (spacer arm) for coupling to the protein.
 The pesticide moiety along with the spacer arm is referred to as hapten.
 The spacer arm not only helps to attach the analyte to the protein, but also helps keep the hapten away from the protein surface and make it freely available to interact with the antibody.
 Following immunization with the hapten protein conjugate, antibodies are produced by the animal's immune system.
 Successful antibody production strongly depends on the immune response of the animal, characteristics of the conjugate and the route and mode of immunization.
 Theimmune response consists of an initial primary response followed by secondary response.
 Antibodies of secondary response are usually of a higher magnitude of affinity than the primary response.
 Antibodies are collected at this time by obtaining the serum, and they are characterized for selectivity, sensitivity and suitability for the immunoassay.
 Assay Format for Competitive Direct ELISA ELISA
 In this assay, the analyte specific antibodies are immobilized into the walls of the microassay plate or tube.
 The sample to be analyzed (100 �l) along with the fixed amount of enzyme labeled analyte (100 �l) are added to the antibody coated plate.
 The sample is incubated, during which time the enzyme-labeled and -unlabeled analyte in the test sample compete for binding sites on the antibodies.
 Afterwards the unreacted material is washed and the amount of enzyme substrate that forms a chromatic product is estimated by calorimetric method.
 The amount of color developed is inversely proportional to the amount of unlabeled analyte in the original sample (KARANTH et al., 1998b).
 The IC50 values are at the ppb levels as shown in Table VI.
  Pesticide residues in vegetables are usually present in low concentrations.
 Hence the residues need to be partitioned to organic solvents before analysis.
 During the process of extraction, some constituents of the vegetables also get extracted into the solvent and often interfere with immunoassay.
 This is called �Matrix effect�.
 We have developed methods for removal of matrices from the extract.
 The matrix clean-up method varies according to thecommodity and the pesticide.
 A universal clean-up procedure for different classes of foodsincluding vegetables has been developed and described in Table VII.
 ELISA methods can be considered as appropriate techniques for developing countries like India, as they are simple (little training needed), cheap to perform and do not requireexpensive equipment.
 Immunoassays can be formatted as compact test kits which can be designed for either laboratory or field study.
 Laboratory kits usually use microwell ELISA plates, which enable simultaneous analysis of 1 to 96 samples at a time, hence with a very low cost per test.
  Indigenous laboratory prototype kits based on ELISA techniques have been developed at CFTRI for pesticides such as Endosulfan, DDT, Methyl and Ethyl parathion and Carbendazim and are ready for commercialization.
 Challenges of Limiting Pesticide Residues in Vegetables Vegetables
 Intensive studies carried out at CFTRI revealed that the source of pesticide contamination of vegetables is mainly soil on which the vegetables are grown.
 Several challenging approaches have been made to limit the migration of pesticides into vegetables.
 Some of the salient achievements are described below.
 Food Safety Management in Developing Countries 5 5
 Selective Food Production in Pesticide-Contaminated Soil Soil
 Plants� differential ability to pick up pesticide residues from the soil has been exploited to identify �pesticide-insensitive� crops.
 Studies with HCH-treated soil (10 ppm) has indicated that knol-khol and carrot are not sensitive to soil residues, as shown in Table VIII.
 Growth and yield of these crops and nutrient quality of the tubers are not decreased (Table IX).
 GLC analysis of the residue in edible parts suggested a presence of under 3 ppm, the tolerance limit established for human consumption (Table X).
 Hence, carrot and knol-khol can be identified as "choice plants" (KARANTH et al, 1982a, SRIMATHI et al., 1983).
 Knol-khol and carrot can be grown as selective rotation crops in HCH-contaminated horticultural and agricultural soil, or can be grown to reclaim the heavily polluted soils such as those present in coffee plantations in India (KARANTH et al, 1983a).
 Pesticide Residue Abatement Using a �Catch Plant� Plant�
 Mini field plot experiments showed that coriander and chili plants have the ability to absorb most of the HCH residues from the soil and prevent leaching to ground water.
 These are hence designated as �Catch Plants� useful for abating HCH residues from soil and irrigation water.
 Laboratory studies have revealed that the chili plant has a well developed biochemical mechanism to deal with this alien chemical and hence the good quality fruits formed are devoid of residues.
 Chili cultivation in HCH contaminated soils has dual advantages of:
 (a) removing pesticide from the contaminated soil (Table X), and (b) decontaminating it through degradation in the vegetative plant body.
 Hence cultivation of chili could form a suitable �redeeming technology� in agricultural and horticultural practice (KARANTH et al, 1982a, 1983a).
 Microbial Degradation of Pesticides in Soil and Prevention of Residue Residue
 Contamination of Vegetables Vegetables
 Apart from using the plants for limiting entry of pesticide residues into vegetables as described above, the potential of microorganisms to degrade and remove pesticides from agro-horticultural soils through bioremediation has also been successfully attempted in our Institute (KARANTH, 1992, DORIS et al., 1990).
 Agrocure for HCH Degradation Degradation
 A microbial preparation has been developed to degrade HCH in the soil.
 A Pseudomonas strain Ptm+ was isolated from soil treated with HCH and shown to degrade HCH (KARANTH & DEO, 1993, 1995, 1997; KARANTH & ANU, 1994).
 This strain was cultivated in a mineral medium in the laboratory and then the culture was poured into a mixture of neutral lignite powder and neutral coir pith taken in a sterile polythene pouch.
 After thorough mixing, the preparation was "cured" in polythene pouches by incubating at ambient temperature (25+2oC).
 The resultant product, �Agrocure�, has a 90-day shelf life and contains about 3 billion cells per gram of the product.
 Pot culture experiments with tomato and groundnut have proved that augmenting the soil with this bio-powder accelerated HCH degradation in the soil (Table XI) (KARANTH, 1992).
 At the same time, application of Agrocure minimized the uptake of the insecticide by crops from the soil due to reduced availability as a result of degradation.
 Decrease in the residue level by increased rate of degradation led to a cascade of beneficial effects.
 The bioaugmentation us protected the soil enzyme activity (KARANTH et al., 1984), promoted the growth of plants, improved the nutrient quality of the vegetables and removed the phytotoxic effect of HCH (Table XII) (DORIS et al, 1990).
 Non-conventional Methods for Pesticide Degradation Degradation
 The HCH scavenger P.
 tralucida produced an extra-cellular surfactant which increased the dispersibility of HCH almost 250-fold.
 This is the first ever report anywhere in the world on the production of a surfactant specific to solid organochlorine pesticides (ANU & KARANTH, 1991).
 There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the surfactant has varied and diverse roles:
 dispersion of HCH in the medium, increasing the surface area of HCH, enhancing cell aggregation and aiding in scavenging.
 Thus, the bio-emulsifier is involved in the overall decontamination and degradation of HCH.
 Exploitation of such secondary metabolites of micro-organisms has great promise in the abatement of pesticide residue in the environment (KARANTH & DEO, 1998a).
 Development of a Biosurfactant to Remove HCH Residues from the Contaminated Contaminated
 Surfaces Surfaces
 �Baxeklen�, a biosurfactant produced by an HCH-degrading bacterial strain, is useful in dislodging HCH residues from vegetables (Table XIII), for pesticide container cleaning, in washing of pesticide mixing tanks in the pesticide manufacturing industry and also in preparing pesticide EC (emulsifiable concentrate) formulations.
 This is again a redeeming technology in the management of objectionable lipophilic molecules posing occupational health hazard.
 Future Directions Directions
 The pioneering work conducted at CFTRI , as described above, indicates that there is an urgency to monitor our water and soil resources for pesticides and develop redeeming technologies to mitigate residues so as to limit the pesticide entry into the vegetables and ensure safe food production.
 We are aware that our research contribution is just a tip of the iceberg.
 However, we have definitely shown that the challenges to abate chemical pollutants such as insecticides can find solutions by the deployment of plants and microbes.
 A collaborative and joint venture including different research and development organizations, industries and governmental agencies is needed to strengthen the voyage towards a cleanerenvironment.
 Only such multi-institutional, mega-projects can help to offer a package deal to meet the challenges of limiting pesticide residues in vegetables to the benefit of the common man and of conserving nature in all its grandeur.

 Pesticide residues - hidden extras extras
 Pesticides are present in many of the foods that we regularly eat, but we can�t see them or taste them and so they are hard to avoid.
 Surveys of consumers regularly show that most people would prefer to eat food without pesticide residues.
 How do we know which foods have the most pesticides on them?
 How safe are they?
 What can we do to reduce our intake of pesticides?
 Which pesticides are most likely to occur and what hazards do they pose?
 These pages are designed to answer these questions and provide the public with the information they need to make informed choices about what they eat.
 We have looked at all the available data to identify which foods are likely to cause the greatest consumption of residues.
 Further details on how we did this can be found here.

 � Consider replacing those items on the top ten list with organic organic
 � Increase your consumption of fruit and veg least likely to contain residues residues
 � Make your concerns known to your local supermarket supermarket

 Abstract Abstract
 In laboratory choice and no-choice bioassays, treatment of elm leaves with extracts obtained from unripe fruits and green or senescent leaves of Melia azedarach at 1�10% concentration significantly deterred feeding by adults of the elm leaf beetle, Xanthogaleruca luteola.
 Also, in no-choice tests, adults fed on leaves treated with 2, 5 or 10% extract showed a dramatic increase in mortality rates.
 Extracts from the different plant structures were similarly active, and starvation as a consequence of their strong antifeedant activity could play a significant role in the high mortality values observe observe
  Bobgunnia madagascariensis, a wild leguminous tree in its indigenous use is cited as being used for fodder and exhibit termite-resistant properties.
 In the feeding deterrent tests, the methanol extract of all parts of the B.
 Feeding Inhibition Rates recorded in the chloroform and methanol extracts from the leaves, stem and root barks of the B.
 madagascariensis showed considerable level of feeding inhibition rates, values were higher than 50% in most of the concentrations.
 For the contact toxicity tests, of the doses tested, 100�g/insect resulted in the highest contact toxicity to the red flour beetles, T.
 casteneum producing >70% mortality after 72hours of application with the methanol extracts.
  Provision of food has always been a challenge facing mankind, the only major cornerstone in this challenge is the competition from insect pests.
 While some pest-associated losses occur when the crops are standing in the farms or greenhouses, others are caused during storage in grain elevators, storage bins and granaries.
 Application of chemical pesticides minimized the threat from pest manifestations by rapidly controlling them, albeit with very little consideration of (i) quality (nutritional content) of the crop; (ii) quality of agro residues (fodder); (iii) distribution of micro-flora in the soil; and (iv) eco-system impact.
 The use of pesticides is one means of preventing some losses during storage.
 However, the choice of pesticides for storage pest control is very limited because of the strict requirements imposed for the safe use of synthetic insecticides on or near food.
 The continuous use of chemical pesticides for control of stored-grain pests has resulted in serious problems such as food poisoning.
 Furthermore, the efficacy of insecticides against storage pests varies greatly after treatment.
 Chemicals used for control of stored product pests, or as protectants, need also to be compared with the suitability and effectiveness of alternative methods of control.
 Nonchemical methods are attractive since they neither leave chemical residues in the commodity nor do they cause resistance in insects.
 The public awareness and concern for environmental quality, has led to more focused attention on research and development of biological agents, either as alternatives or in integrated programmes.
 A promising strategy with good potential to minimize the adverse effects of insecticides is the use of plants with feeding deterrent activity.
 Farmers, through a long history of battle against stored product pest, have learnt to exploit natural resources, or to implement accessible methods, that would lead to a degree of population suppression of pests.
 Traditional methods usually provide cheap and feasible ways of post-harvest handling of the crops.
 During storage, some traditionally used plant materials are often added to the product, which contribute to the reduction of pests activity WHAT ARE INSECT ANTIFEEDANTS?
 These are substance that reduces the consumption ability of an insect.
 It is a behaviour modifying substance that deters feeding through a direct action on the taste organs in the insects.
 This definition excludes chemicals that suppress feeding by acting on the central nervous system following ingestion and absorption [2].
 Antifeedant activity is generally demonstrated through laboratory bioassays consisting of either choice or non-choice tests conducted over a short duration.
 The red flour beetle, Tribolium casteneum (Hbst), is a common insect that attacks stored grains and foods in the pantry.
 This insect has a world wide distribution and is very abundant in Africa.
 The red flour beetle is a secondary storage pest, which is an externally developing insect that feeds primarily on damaged corn (i.e.
 broken kernels, germ and grain dust) or other cereal products.
 The beetles do cause damage by feeding but cause more problems by contaminating the grain.
  The plant, Bobgunnia madagascariensis (Desv.) J.H.Kirkbr & Wiersema is being studied for its potential to act as a feeding deterrent against the storage maize weevil, Tribolium casteneum Hbst.
 madagascariensis, also known as �the Snake bean plant� (formerly known as Swartzia madagascariensis) is a very common tree in many regions of Africa.
 Various parts of this plant are used by traditional healers in Africa for medicinal purposes [5].
 The fruits have also been reported to be toxic to snails and have been related to the causative agent of human schistosomiasis.
 Chemical constituents in the fruits effectively kill schistosomiasis-transmitting snails.
 Insecticidal activity against termites as well as antifungal activity have also been reported [6-8].
 The snake bean in its indigenous use has its root bark or leaves pounded and mixed with a litre of water, allowed to infuse for twelve to twenty fours hours, strained and sprayed or drenched over termite nests as the plant's constituents are said to deter termites.
  The plant samples of Bobgunnia madagascariensis comprising the leaves, stem bark and root bark were collected at Sakaru village in Kaduna state, Nigeria.
 The plant samples were authenticated at the Department of Biological Sciences, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and voucher specimen were deposited with Herbarium number 430.
 These plant materials were cut into smaller pieces and air-dried and pulverized using a blender.
 madagascariensis extracts were determined using the wheat wafer disc bioassay techniques .
 An FI value under 30% when treated at 10mg/ml for a wafer disc is indicated as inactive in the study [9-10].
 Aluminium phosphide (Phostoxin), a storage pesticide/fumigant used by farmers in Northern Nigeria for post harvest storage of grains and pulses was used as the control reference.
 Aluminium phosphide is the chemical compound with the formula AlP.
 The colourless solid is generally sold as a grey-green-yellow powder or tablet and is used as a fumigant/repellent in post harvest storage of grains in many parts of Northern Nigeria.
 Wheat wafer discs, made of finely ground flour and water and baked at 80oC were used as the test food or substrate.
 The discs (2.5 cm diameters within weights of (0.30-0.35g) were saturated by dipping into the solvents and the test solutions in two concentrations of 0.05 and 0.10ppm.
 The discs, after the treatments were air-dried over night, weighed and presented to the Tribolium beetles.
 Ten (10) of the flour beetles in each Petri dish were introduced into the treated and weighed wafer discs and monitored over a period of five (5) days.
 Some blank discs (treated with solvents but not offered to the insects were also prepared).
 The wafer discs were weighed before the experiments and 5days after the test insects had been feeding on them.
 Each treatment was replicated five times.
 After the feeding deterrency tests had been completed, to measure the activity of the test compounds, the Antifeedant Index AFI was used.
 The AFI is a measure of the percentage of the weight of the treated wafer discs consumed in comparison with the untreated wafer discs.
 AFI = %Weight of Treated Disc Consumed x 100 %Weight of Treated Disc Consumed + %Weight of Control Disc Consumed The AFI values obtained are then converted to the feeding inhibition rate FI (%).
 FI (%) = (50 � AFI) x 2 An FI value under 30% when treated at 0.10ppm for a wafer disc is indicated as inactive in the study.A standard storage pesticide/fumigant, Aluminium phosphide 57% (Phostoxin), was used as the control.
  The insects used for the tests were reared under laboratory conditions at 27 + 2oC and 75 + 5% Relative humidity on a diet mixture of wheat meal of 190g of whole meal wheat flour and 10g of brewer�s yeast (ratio 19:1).
 Test organisms used were starved for 36-48hrs before being introduced into the Petri dishes containing the prepared wafer discs.
  Tests for contact toxicity by topical treatment were conducted according to the standard method [9].
 Stock solutions were prepared by dissolving 100mg of each extract in 100ml of the appropriate solvents.
 Lower concentrations (100, 60, 40, 20 and 10mg/ml) were obtained by dilution of the stock solution with the appropriate solvents.
 Insects were chilled for a period of ten (10) minutes to immobilize them.
 These immobilized insects were picked individually (using a small suction tube).
 1�l of each of the prepared concentrations (100, 60, 40, 20 or 10�g/insect) was applied to the dorsal surface of the thorax of the insect using a capillary tube.
 Fifty insects, in replicates of 10 each, were treated for each dose.
 In addition, the same number was treated with solvents only as control in each experimental set.
 After treatment, insects were transferred into 9.0cm diameter Petri dishes (10 insects/Petri dish) containing food (mixture of 95% whole meal wheat flour and 5% Brewer�s yeast).
 Insects were examined daily and those that did not move or respond to gentle touch from the tip of a capillary tube were considered as dead.
 Insect mortalities were recorded at 24, 48 and 72hours after treatment; the data was analyzed using the STATPLUS 2008 software.
 Results were expressed as micrograms per insect.
 Two LD50 values were considered to be significantly different (P <0.05) if their 95% fiducial limits did not overlap; slopes were similarly considered to be significantly different if their standard errors did not overlap.
  In the feeding deterrent tests, (Table 1), it was observed that at a concentration of 0.10ppm, the methanol extract of all parts of the B.
 madagascariensis showed deterrent activity against the red flour beetle, Tribolium casteneum.
 In the study, the T. casteneum were highly sensitive to all the test compounds except for the n-hexane extracts from each part of the plant.
 [1559-1566] 1563 compared to that of the 0.10ppm BRME with 70.66%.
 Though the concentration used for the control were lower because the test was being conducted on pure synthesized compounds while the B.
 madagascariensis were crude extracts.
 It was observed that at 0.10ppm, insect mortality was up to 100% when the Aluminium phosphide was used.
 The antifeedant activities recorded in the chloroform and methanol extracts from the leaves, stem and root barks of the B.
 madagascariensis showed considerable level of feeding inhibition rates, values were higher than 50% in most of the concentrations with the exception of the 0.05ppm Chloroform extract for the leaves.
 This feeding deterrent activity could also be attributed to the different class of secondary metabolites which had been detected present in the plant extracts from the phytochemical screening tests.
 A comparison of the feeding inhibition observed in the methanol extracts of the various parts of the plant was also done compared to the standard storage pesticide used as a control, Phostoxin (Aluminium phosphide 57%).
 Table 1.
 Feeding Deterrent Co-efficient of Bobgunnia madagascariensis Extracts for Red Flour Beetles, Tribolium casteneum.
 CONTACT TOXICITY TEST RESULT RESULT
 Of the doses tested, 100�g/insect resulted in the highest contact toxicity to the red flour beetles (Table 2).
 From the probit analyses as tabulated in Table 3, comparison of the LD50 values among the extracts showed that the methanol (BRME) was the most toxic (LD50 38.1�g/insect) to the red flour beetles, followed by BSME (LD50 39.2�g/insect).
 BRNX was the least toxic to the beetles with LD50 476.90 �g/insect followed by BLNX (LD50 127.3�g/insect).
 Contact toxicity test results using the control, Aluminium phosphide was 100% mortality at all concentrations.
 This is not surprising because the compound is highly toxic; there is always a restriction on consumption of grains usually preserved with this chemical compound for a certain period of months by the farmers.
 In cases where such adherence had not been taken into consideration, there had been reports of food poisoning and in some cases, death of households from consumption of such meals preserved with the compound.
 CONCLUSION CONCLUSION
 From the results obtained, the plant extracts of B.
 madagascariensis could serve as a crop protectant, these findings indicate the plant has a high potential for controlling and protecting the grains from the weevil, T.
 casteneum beetles as an alternative to the synthetic Aluminum phosphide compound.
 Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which is defined and implemented in manyways, has a place in planning, developing and adopting eco friendly technologies.
 Aimed at controlling pests on a sustainable basis, IPM envisages modification of pesticide usage patterns so as to minimize the negative impact of chemical pesticides.
 It has also been recognized that plant-derived secondary metabolites can be incorporated into products suitable for IPM based on their selectivity and few, if any, side effects on non-target organisms or the environment.
 Within each generation of chemical insecticide developed so far, there are examples of products that were derived from natural plant compounds using the identified and isolated secondary metabolites.
 The plant secondary metabolites, with their roles in fundamental physiological or biochemical processes of the plant may also be involved in protecting the plant against diseases, pests, herbivores and environmental stress.
 These plant secondary metabolites may serve as repellents, antifeedants or toxins for the insect pests.

 Baits used in New Zealand for the control of introduced vertebrate pests, such as brushtail possums and rats, are eaten by non-target invertebrates, such as ants, beetles and weta.
 Potential invertebrate antifeedants that could be added to the baits were identified by manual and computer-based searches of the scientific literature, and by consulting other scientists, scientific organisations, and chemical companies.
 A large number of compounds with invertebrate antifeedant activity (mainly repellents and deterrents) were identified.
 However, only a few invertebrate antifeedants have been developed for practical use.
 Most have been used as insect repellents for the protection of humans from biting insects (e.g.
 diethyl toluamide (DEET), dimethyl phthalate (DMP), citronella oil, and eucalyptus oil).
 A few invertebrate antifeedants have been used for the protection of seeds, crops, stored products, and other commodities (e.g. neem oil), and also to prevent invertebrates from eating baits used for vertebrate pest control (e.g. DMP and alpha-cypermethrin).
 We recommend that DEET, DMP, citronella oil, eucalyptus oil, neem oil, and alphacypermethrin be evaluated for palatability to possums and rats, and then for antifeedant effects to invertebrates likely to eat baits in New Zealand.
 Commercially available insect repellents (such as in aerosol fly sprays or slowrelease polymer strips) should also be evaluated for use in bait stations to reduce invertebrate consumption of baits.
  Baits containing toxicants such as sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) or brodifacoum are used extensively in New Zealand, both in bait stations and aerially spread over the ground, for the control of introduced vertebrate pests such as the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), ship rat (Rattus rattus), Norway rat (R.
 norvegicus), kiore (R. exulans), and house mouse (Mus musculus).
 Pesticides is an antifeedant which is used for protecting seeds.
 The baits used in bait stations are usually either cereal-based pellets or fruit-based pastes or gels, whereas those spread from the air are either cerealbased pellets or chopped carrots.
 As well as being eaten by the target species, these baits are also eaten by invertebrates (Sherley et al. 1999; Spurr & Drew 1999; Lloyd & McQueen 2000).
 In aerial operations, exposure of the toxicant to invertebrates is ?one-off?
 or infrequent, but on offshore islands and in some mainland situations pest control operators are committed to using baits in bait stations, sometimes for extended periods of time, which gives prolonged exposure of the toxicants to invertebrates.
 Neither aerial distribution of 1080 nor use of brodifacoum in bait stations is likely to have any deleterious longterm impacts on ground-dwelling invertebrate populations (Spurr 1994, 1996a, 2000; Sherley et al.1999; Spurr & Drew 1999).
 However, concern has been expressed that invertebrates that eat baits may be transporting toxicants into the environment and, through the food chain, into insect-feeding birds such as the brown kiwi (Apteryx australis) and morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae), and mammals such as the short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) (Eason et al.
  If invertebrates could be prevented from eating baits then they would not ingest toxicants and transport them through the food chain.
 The use of an invertebrate antifeedant that is palatable to possums and rodents would achieve this.
 This paper reviews the international literature on invertebrate antifeedants, as a basis for selecting the most promising to test for (a) palatability to possums and rodents and (b) antifeedant effects on those New Zealand invertebrates considered likely to feed on baits used for vertebrate pest control.
  The international scientific literature on invertebrate antifeedants was searched manually and by using computer-based abstracting services (CAB Abstracts, Current Contents, and Agricola).
 The following scientists in New Zealand and other countries, scientific organisations, and chemical companies were also consulted:
 The terms ?antifeedant?, ?inhibitor?, ?repellent?, ?suppressant?, and ?deterrent?  are often used interchangeably in the literature, but have different meanings.
 Repellents actively repel the invertebrate away from the source of the repellent before it has made contact with it.
 Suppressants suppress the initiation of feeding after the invertebrate has made contact with the source.
 Deterrents deter the continuation of feeding after feeding has started (Chapman 1974; Schoonhoven 1982; Warthen & Morgan 1990).
 The terms ?antifeedant?  or ?inhibitor?  may be used when it is not possible to determine the mode of action of a compound.
 We have used the term ?antifeedant?  in this review unless the specific action of a compound is known.
 Antifeedants inhibit feeding without killing the invertebrate.
 The terms ?invertebrate?, ?arthropod?, and ?insect?  are all used in the literature in reference to antifeedants.
 Invertebrate refers to all animals without a backbone.
 Arthropod refers to invertebrates with a hard, jointed exoskeleton (Phylum Arthropoda).
 This includes isopods (Class Crustacea), spiders, harvestmen, mites, and ticks (Arachnida), millipedes (Diplopoda), springtails (Collembola), and insects (Insecta).
 However, arthropods do not include invertebrates such as earthworms (Phylum Annelida) or slugs and snails (Mollusca), which have also been recorded eating baits used for possum or rodent control.
 More than 1000 references on invertebrate antifeedants were retrieved.
  Abstracts (January 1990 to January 2001) had no references listed under the search term ?invertebrate antifeedant?, but 172 references under ?insect antifeedant?
 and 724 under ?insect repellent?
  There were 5224 references under ?insect?  and ?repellent?  combined, including some relevant references not listed using the phrase ?insect repellent?.
 Some irrelevant references were also obtained.
 Included in the references retrieved (and references cited within) were a number of reviews of invertebrate antifeedants (e.g.
  Information from these reviews forms the basis of the present review.
 8 Spurr & McGregor?Potential invertebrate antifeedants antifeedants
  Many compounds with invertebrate antifeedant activity (mainly repellents and deterrents) have been identified.
 For example, Norris (1990) listed 435 natural insect repellents and Warthen & Morgan (1990) listed 549 natural insect feeding deterrents.
 New antifeedants continue to be discovered (e.g.
  The literature on invertebrate antifeedants can be divided into two groups:
  Compounds in the former group are repellents, whereas those in the latter group are usually either suppressants or deterrents.
 The same compounds are seldom used for both purposes.
 A further division occurs between natural and synthetic compounds.
 Natural compounds are generally regarded as more acceptable for pest control purposes than synthetic ones (Jermy 1983).
 Investigations into antifeedants have been carried out almost exclusively in the laboratory, usually with only one invertebrate species, using short-term, often two-choice tests, on a variety of substrates, and without behavioural observations (Bernays 1983; Jermy 1990).
 Most experiments have used larvae of the lepidopterans Spodoptera spp.
  (cabbage white butterflies), or the locusts Locusta migratoria and Schistocerca gregaria.
 These are all insects that can be reared in laboratories (Jermy 1990; Warthen & Morgan 1990).
 Short-term tests such as these ignore the possibility of habituation, and morphogenetic or other toxic effects.
 The variety of substrates (carriers for the test compound, e.g.
 food, agar, filter paper) used in the tests may also have influenced the insect?s response to a chemical (Jermy 1990).
 Furthermore, many of the compounds tested are not available or not available in suitable quantities for further studies (Jermy 1990; Russell & Lane 1993).
 It is therefore difficult to judge what proportion of the numerous antifeedants described so far can be regarded as promising for practical purposes (Jermy 1990).
 To date, only a few of the large number of potential invertebrate antifeedants identified have been developed for practical use.
 Most are insect repellents for the protection of humans from biting insects.
 Before about 1940, four insect repellents were commercially available:
 citronella oil, dimethyl phthalate (DMP), indalone (butyl 3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-4-oxo-2H-pyran-6-carboxylate), and Rutgers 612 (2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol) (Brown & Herbert 1997).
 Since World War 2, the most widely used, and most effective, insect repellent has been diethyl toluamide (DEET) (Brown & Herbert 1997; Chou et al.
  Other potential insect repellents have been tested, and some, such as N,N-diethyl-2-phenylacetamide (DEPA), have been found to be as effective as DEET (Kalyanasundaram et al.
  However, they have not yet been commercially developed.
 Science for Conservation 232 9 A few invertebrate antifeedants have been developed for the protection of seeds, crops, stored produce, and other commodities.
 In India, for example, various invertebrate-antifeedant extracts of neem (Azadirachta indica) have been used to protect crops and stored grain for many years (Mordue & Blackwell 1993; Nigam et al.1994).
 In the UK, polygodial, an extract from the water-pepper plant (Polygonum hydropiper), has been used experimentally to protect barley from aphids (Warthen & Morgan 1990; Jain & Tripathi 1993; Pickett et al.1997; Srivastava et al. 1999), but polygodial is not available ommercially.
 In New Zealand, most products used for the control of invertebrate pests in these situations are organophosphate or carbamate insecticides (O?Connor 2000).
 For example, seeds are treated with organophosphates such as maldison, carbamates such as furathiocarb and methiocarb, or the nitromethylene imidacloprid, and stored grain is treated with organophosphates such as dichlorvos, maldison, and pirimiphos-methyl, or carbamates such as propoxur (O?Connor 2000).
 These products are primarily insecticidal but some may also have a repellent or deterrent function.
 Invertebrate antifeedants have been identified for the protection of seeds 
 However, these have yet to be commercially developed.
 Invertebrate antifeedants have also been used to reduce the incidence of invertebrates eating baits used for vertebrate pest control.
 A synthetic pyrethroid (probably alpha-cypermethrin) is incorporated in Storm� (American Cyanamid Co.), a bait used for rat control and containing the anticoagulant flocoumafen, to prevent attack by insects (according to a product information brochure).
 Chemical insect repellents have also been added to bait used in traps for small mammals in the USA, to reduce insect removal of the baits.
 Coleman (1950) and Golley (1961) mixed DDT into baits (peanut butter and grain), and Anderson & Ohmart (1977) mixed DMP into baits (peanut butter and rolled oats).
 The DMP-treated baits repelled ants for 20 hours and still attracted rodents in about the same numbers and proportions as untreated baits.
 However, the rodents were not required to eat these baits, because they were used only as lures, so the palatability of DMP to rodents was not determined.
 The use of DMP as an insect repellent in baits for small mammals was also investigated in an unsighted MSc thesis (Roese 1984).
 Bait removal by insects has also been reduced by applying a chemical insect repellent to an area around traps, rather than by mixing it into the baits.
 Chabreck et al. (1986) applied diazinon and Dursban� (containing chlorpyrifos) to trap sites.
 Gettinger (1990) sprayed Raid Ant & Roach Killer� (containing 0.95% propoxur and 83% petroleum distillate) around trap sites.
 All treatments reduced bait removal by insects such as ants.
 However, as above, the rodents were not required to ingest the insect repellents.
 Honeybee (Apis mellifera) removal of apple paste bait containing 1080 used for brushtail possum control in New Zealand was reduced experimentally by the addition of molasses or oxalic acid (Goodwin & Ten Houten 1991).
 Possums readily ate the baits containing molasses but not the baits containing oxalic acid (Morgan et al.  1993).
 However, molasses turned the apple paste black, and the Pesticides (Vertebrate Pest Control) Regulations 1983 require baits containing 10 Spurr & McGregor?Potential invertebrate antifeedants 1080 to be a specific shade of green.
 Morgan et al.  (1993) screened a further 29 compounds for repellency to honeybees.
 Of the eight compounds most repellent to honeybees, three (0.5?1% isovaleric acid, 0.5% N,N-dibutylformamide, and 1% maleic anhydride) did not reduce the palatability of apple paste to possums.
 The other five (0.5% Ambush� 50 EC (containing 5% permethrin), 1% safrole, 0.5% salicyaldehyde, 0.5% carvacrol, and 0.5% 2-heptanone) did reduce palatability to possums.
 Isovaleric acid was the most cost-effective, but proved too unpleasant for field staff to use (D.R. Morgan pers.
  Spurr (1996b) found that 1% isovaleric acid, 1% valeric acid, 1% N,N-dibutylformamide, 1% maleic anhydride, and 1% 2-heptanone in sugar syrup were repellent to German and common wasps (Vespula germanica and V.vulgaris).
 Cinnamon oil is currently added to baits containing 1080 used for possum control (0.1% w/w) to mask the smell and taste of 1080 to possums (Morgan 1990).
 However, it is also an invertebrate antifeedant.
 For example, it reduced the incidence of invertebrates, predominantly ants, beetles, and weta (Orthoptera), feeding on baits by more than 50% (Spurr & Drew 1999).
 It also repels German and common wasps (E.B. Spurr pers. obs).
 The most potent invertebrate feeding deterrents known are warburganal, muzigadial, and azadirachtin (Warthen & Morgan 1990).
 Warburganal and muzigadial are active at 0.1 ppm against armyworms (Spodoptera spp.), and azadirachtin is active on a host of different invertebrates, at concentrations as low as 0.35 ppm against the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) (Warthen & Morgan 1990).
 Ugandensidial and polygodial are also active against armyworms at 0.1 ppm; aristolochic acid is active against locusts (Locusta migratoria) at 0.01 ppm, pilocarpine is active against the silkworm (Bombyx mori) at 0.04 ppm, salicin is active against B. mori at 0.06 ppm, and strychnine is active against B. mori at 0.03 ppm (Warthen & Morgan 1990).
 There has been no direct comparison of the effectiveness of DEET, claimed to be the most potent insect repellent developed so far (Brown & Herbert 1997; Chou et al. 1997; Qui et al.
 1998), and azadirachtin, muzigadial, and warburganal, claimed to be the most potent invertebrate feeding deterrents known (Warthen & Morgan 1990).
 It is extremely difficult to compare the potency of different antifeedants on different invertebrate species, because some antifeedants that are potent on certain invertebrate species have no effect on other invertebrate species (Warthen & Morgan 1990; Pickett et al.1997).
 For example, polygodial, effective against aphids, has little antifeedant effect on beetles (Pickett et al. 1997).
 On the other hand, ajugarins (in the clerodane class of diterpenoids) are extremely effective against beetles, particularly those in the family Chrysomelidae, but not against aphids (Pickett et al.1997). .
  Not all invertebrate antifeedants possess the qualities required for economic and practical use (Chapman 1974).
 Ascher (1992) listed 16 desired properties of an invertebrate antifeedant:
  No habituation or resistance.
 Only (1) ?no phytotoxicity?, (4) ?otherwise toxic against pests?, (7) ?systemic and translaminar action?, and (14) ?high concentration in source plant?
 do not apply to the requirements for an invertebrate antifeedant in baits for vertebrate pest control, as we want to protect native invertebrates, not destroy them.
 However, this does not necessarily exclude the use of an insecticide because many insecticides have repellent and / or deterrent properties (e.g.
 Thomson 1982; Husain et al. 1994; Nigam et al. 1994; O?Connor 2000).
 Thus, an insecticide may be appropriate as an antifeedant if it clearly prevents invertebrates from eating the bait to which it is applied.
 Other criteria required or preferred for an invertebrate antifeedant for baits include:
  Low toxicity to invertebrates invertebrates
  Palatable to possums and rats rats
  Able to withstand heating to 65?90�C 65?90�C
  Already registered in New Zealand (with the Agricultural Compounds and and
 Veterinary Medicines group, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry), or overseas (e.g.
 with the US Environmental Protection Agency), or does not require registration.
 Very few potential invertebrate antifeedants have been tested for palatability to possums and rats.
 Morgan (1990) found that 20 out of 39 food flavours tested (most presented at a concentration of 0.01% vol/wt on barley) did not reduce the palatability of the barley to possums.
 Of these, only cinnamon oil is likely to be antifeedant to invertebrates.
 Very low concentrations of flavours such as blackberry and strawberry did reduce the palatability of barley to possums.
 Cinnamamide, a known invertebrate antifeedant, is palatable to possums but not to Norway rats (Crocker et al. 1993; Spurr & Porter 1998) or house mice (Gurney et al. 1996).
 An ability to withstand temperatures of 65?90�C is required because these temperatures are encountered in the process of manufacturing the cereal-based baits used for possum and rodent control (W.
 Simmons, Animal Control Products, pers. comm.).
 12 Spurr & McGregor?Potential invertebrate antifeedants antifeedants
 Compounds already registered in New Zealand or overseas for other purposes (e.g.
 as insecticides) would be easier and less costly to register as invertebrate antifeedants in baits used for vertebrate pest control than compounds not already registered.
 This section provides information on some compounds identified in the literature as insect repellents or deterrents.
 Information about these compounds given above is repeated below for completeness.
 Some of the compounds are clearly not suitable for use as invertebrate antifeedants in baits used for vertebrate pest control, but they have been included below so that they can be discounted from further consideration.
  Alpha-cypermethrin Description Alpha-cypermethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid, with insecticidal and antifeedant activity.
 Technical-grade alpha-cypermethrin is a white powder (> 90% pure).
 It has a weak aromatic odour, is relatively stable to light, and is thermally stable up to 220�C (Tomlin 1994).
 Commercially available formulations (emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates, and wettable powders) contain 1.5?
 35% alpha-cypermethrin.
 Invertebrate activity lpha-cypermethrin was repellent to the mites Tetranychus urticae and Panonychus ulmi (Ahn et al. 1993), the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) (Fuchs 1988), honeybee (de Wael & van Laere 1989), and armyworm (Fisk & Wright 1992).
 A concentration of 0.2% alpha-cypermethrin in a gel bait was repellent to (unspecified) cockroaches (Terekhova 1995).
 Alpha-cypermethrin is believed to be the synthetic pyrethroid incorporated into Storm� (American Cyanamid Co.), a bait used for rat control containing the anticoagulant flocoumafen, to prevent attack by insects.
 The concentration of alpha-cypermethrin in the bait is unknown but, because it is not listed, is presumably < 0.05%.
 Its effectiveness at deterring invertebrates is also unknown.
 Vertebrate activity activity
 The acute oral LD50 of alpha-cypermethrin to Norway rats is 474 mg/kg (Tomlin 1994).
 In 90-day feeding trials, rats receiving 60 mg/kg (0.006%) alphacypermethrin in their diet suffered no ill effects (Tomlin 1994).
 Storm� rat bait, containing a synthetic pyrethroid believed to be < 0.05% alpha-cypermethrin, is readily eaten by both rats and mice.
 The palatability of alpha-cypermethrin to possums is unknown.
  Alpha-cypermethrin-based products (emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates, and wettable powders) are readily available from chemical suppliers.
 Technical-grade alpha-cypermethrin is not readily available.2.
  Camphor is a natural compound derived from the camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora).
 It has a familiar and penetrating odour, and a slightly bitter and cooling taste.
 Its boiling point is 204�C, but it sublimes appreciably at room temperature and pressure (Budavari 1996).
 Invertebrate activity activity
 Camphor was commonly used as a moth repellent (Budavari 1996).
 It is a feeding deterrent for the tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens) (Lepidoptera) and the boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis) (Coleoptera) , and a repellent to four species of stored-products beetles.
 Vertebrate activity The palatability of camphor to possums and rodents is unknown.
  Camphor is readily available (e.g. from Sigma Chemical Co.).
   Capsaicin is one of the active ingredients in the fruit of chillis and peppers (Capsicum spp.).
 It has a pungent odour, and burning taste (Budavari 1996).
 Invertebrate activity activity
 Capsaicin has been shown to have antifeedancy to various invertebrates (Warthen & Morgan 1990).
 For example, capsaicin from capsicum in an oleoresin has been used against cotton pests (Mayeux 1996).
 Extracts of capsicum were also repellent to one species of stored-products beetle (Sitophilus zeamais), although not so much to another (Tribolium castaneum) (Ho et al.
  Nougard (Environmental Health Products, Auckland), containing the active ingredient capsaicin, is available in New Zealand as an invertebrate and vertebrate repellent for protection of buildings, citrus trees, and nursery stock.
 Vertebrate activity activity
 Capsaicin is considered universally repellent to mammals at concentrations between 10 and 100 ppm (Mason 1988).
 It is repellent to Norway rats at concentrations as low as 1% (Mason et al. 1991).
  Capsaicin is readily available.
  Cinnamamide is a derivative of cinnamic acid.
  Vertebrate activity Cinnamamide is not repellent to possums at a concentration of 0.5% on carrot bait (Spurr & Porter 1998).
 However, it is repellent to rodents, including Norway rats, at a concentration of 0.25?0.5%, (Crocker et al. 1993; Spurr & Porter 1998) and house mice, at a concentration of 0.1% (Gurney et al. 1996).
  Cinnamamide is readily available.
  Cinnamon oil is derived from Cinnamomum species.
 Its chief component is cinnamaldehyde (up to 90%), a yellowish oil liquid, with a strong cinnamon odour (Budavari 1996).
 It also contains cinnamic acid.
 The boiling point of cinnamaldehyde is 246�C, and of cinnamic acid is 300�C (Budavari 1996).
 Invertebrate activity activity
 Cinnamon oil, at 0.5% concentration, reduced numbers of the beetle Zabrotes subfasciatus feeding on bean seeds by 96% (Oliveira & Vendramim 1999).
 Extracts of cinnamon were also highly repellent to the stored-products beetles Tribolium castaneum and Sitophilus zeamais (Ho et al. 1997; Huang & Ho 1998).
 Cinnamite, a synthesised analogue of cinnamon oil, is effective at concentrations of 0.20?0.25% against mites, aphids, and thrips (Thysanoptera) in greenhouses (Parrella et al. 1999).
 Cinnamon oil, at 0.1% w/w, reduced the incidence of invertebrates, predominantly ants, weta (Orthoptera), and beetles, feeding on baits (carrot and cereal-based) by more than 50% for at least 3 days (Spurr & Drew 1999).
 Cinnamon oil (0.1%) is also repellent to German and common wasps (Hymenoptera) (E.B. Spurr pers. obs).
 Cinnamon oil is currently added to baits used for possum control (at 0.1?0.15% w/w), to mask the smell and taste of 1080 to possums (Morgan 1990; W. Simmons, ACP, pers. comm.) but not to baits for rat control (because it is not needed to mask brodifacoum).
 Because of the rapid loss of cinnamon oil from baits, it has been recommended recently that the cinnamon oil concentration be increased to 0.3% (D.R. Morgan pers. comm.).
  Above 0.5%, cinnamon oil reduced the palatability of baits to possums.
 Cinnamon oil (0.3% w/w) reduced the palatability of a paste bait to laboratory rats (L. Milne pers. comm.).
  Cinnamon oil is available from Bush Boake Allen (Auckland) for c. NZ$100/litre, and from Sigma Chemical Co. for A$128.10/100 ml (Sigma 2000).
 Citronella oil is commonly extracted from citronella grass (Cymbopogon nardus), lemongrass (C. citratus), and related species (e.g.C. winterianus).
 The main component of citronella oil is citronellal, and it also contains citronellol.
 Citronellol has a boiling point of 224.5�C (Budavari 1996).
  Citronella oil was the most popular insect repellent for human use before 1940 (Brown & Herbert 1997), and is still used in some present-day insect repellents (e.g. Brown & Herbert 1997; Chou et al. 1997).
 It was not as effective as DEET in laboratory tests (Chou et al. 1997; Cockcroft et al. 1998; Thorsell et al.
 1998), but was just as effective in a field test (Thorsell et al. 1998).
 When applied to human skin, citronella oil (0.05?10%) was reported as being effective against biting insects for 4 hours or even overnight (Brown & Herbert 1997).
 A 10% solution was effective in the field for at least 8 hours (Thorsell et al. 1998).
 When applied to clothing, citronella oil was effective against the human body louse (Pediculus humanus) for at least 29 days (Mumcuoglu et al. 1996).
 Product trade names include Natrapel (Brown & Herbert 1997) and Buzz Away, which also contains eucalyptus oil (Chou et al. 1997).
 Citronella oil is also available in candles (at a concentration of 3?5%) to reduce the incidence of biting insects (Lindsay et al. 1996).
 Citronella oil is toxic to beetles when there is direct contact of the insect with the oil (Lale 1991).
 When added to sugar syrup (at 0.5?1%), citronella oil reduced the number of Indian honeybees (Apis cerana indica) collecting syrup for 30 hours (Patyal & Kumar 1989).
 In this regard, citronella oil was more effective than eucalyptus oil (Patyal & Kumar 1989).
  The palatability of citronella oil to possums and rodents is unknown.
  Citronella oil is readily available, and may be obtained from Bush Boake Allen (Auckland) for NZ$57.48/kg + GST, and from Essential Oils of New Zealand Ltd for NZ$100/litre + GST.
 Citronellal (3,7-dimethyl-6-octenal) is obtainable from Sigma Chemical Co.
 for A$22.80/100 ml (Sigma 2000).
 16 Spurr & McGregor?Potential invertebrate antifeedants antifeedants
  Cypermethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid, with insecticidal and antifeedant activity.
 It is a yellow-brown viscous semi-solid at ambient temperatures, odourless, relatively stable to light, and thermally stable up to 220�C (Tomlin 1994).
  Cypermethrin reduced food consumption in the bulb mite (Rhizoglyphus robini) (Cohen & Joseph 1992), mustard beetle (Phaedon cochleariae) (Hajjar & Ford 1990), German cockroach (Ross & Cochran 1992), and armyworm (Fisk & Wright 1992).
 The concentration of cypermethrin in the mustard beetle study was 0.05%.
 However, in another study, 1?5 �l of cypermethrin did not deter cockroaches from eating a gel bait (Robinson et al. 1999).
 Cypermethrin was highly repellent, and more repellent than permethrin, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, bendiocarb, or propoxur, to Argentine ants (Linepithema humile = Iridomyrmex humilis) (Knight & Rust 1990).
 A 0.01% cypermethrin spray reduced visits by Indian honeybees (Apis cerana indica) to radish crops for up to 9 days (Rathore et al. 1987).
 In a laboratory trial, cypermethrin was not as repellent to mosquitoes as DEET, but another pyrethroid (Pyrethroid-T, containing the alpha-cyano, 3-phenoxybenzyl moiety) was more repellent than DEET (Braverman & Chizov-Ginzburg 1997).
  The acute oral LD50 of cypermethrin to Norway rats is 7180 mg/kg (Tomlin 1994).
 Its palatability to possums and rodents is unknown.
  Products containing cypermethrin are readily available.
 Diethyl toluamide (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide)
 Diethyl toluamide (DET or DEET), a synthetic compound, is a colourless to amber liquid, with a boiling point of 111�C (Tomlin 1994).
 It can also be obtained in powder form.
 DEET was first marketed as an insect repellent in the 1950s, and is now the most widely used and most effective commercially marketed repellent for biting insects in the world (Brown & Herbert 1997; Chou et al.
 DEET is effective against a wide range of biting and piercing/sucking insects, including mosquitoes, flies, mites (chiggers), ticks, and fleas (Siphonaptera).
 It can be applied to the skin, or to clothing, bedrolls, tents, and insect screens (Curtis et al.
 This implies that it actively repels invertebrates.
 Brown & Herbert (1997) claimed that DEET does not camouflage Science for Conservation 232 17 attractants emanating from the skin, but repels insects when they approach the skin to which it is applied.
 However, Dogan et al. (1999) claimed that the repellent action of DEET does not result from its physical properties, but from an inhibition of lactic acid, a component of human sweat, that is an attractant for mosquitoes.
 If this were the case, then DEET would not be an effective repellent in baits.
 This needs to be clarified.
 The protection time of DEET when applied to skin is 1?6 hours (Curtis et al. 1990).
 To be effective for longer, it needs repeated application.
 Recently, encapsulation in polymers, gels, microcapsules, and microparticles has extended the protection time of DEET to 12?48 hours, or longer in some cases (Rutledge et al.
 1996; Brown & Herbert 1997; Qui et al. 1998; Golenda et al. 999; Salafsky et al. 1999).
 Incorporation into a bait may also extend the time for which it is effective.
 No references were found to DEET being used as an antifeedant for invertebrate pests of stored grain.
 DEET has insecticidal activity on contact, and has caused mortality of invertebrates such as larval mites (Leptotrombidium fletcheri) (e.g. Ho & Fauziah 1993).
 Vertebrate activity activity
 The acute oral LD50 of DEET to Norway rats is c. 2000 mg/kg (Tomlin 1994).
 The palatability of DEET to possums and rodents is unknown.
 However, in 200-day feeding trials, rats receiving 10 000 mg/kg diet suffered no ill-effects (Tomlin 1994).
 DEET is readily available, and may be obtained from Global Science & Technology for NZ$163.50/litre.
  Dimethyl phthalate (or diemthyl 1,2- benzenedicarboxylate) benzenedicarboxylate)
  Dimethyl phthalate (DMP) is a colourless, oily liquid, with a slight aromatic odour, and a boiling point of 283.7�C (Tomlin 1994; Budavari 1996).
 It used to be available in powder form.
 Invertebrate activity activity
 DMP was one of the earliest synthetic insect repellents discovered (Brown & Herbert 1997).
 It is effective against a variety of invertebrates, including mosquitoes, sandflies, ticks, and mites (Frances 1994; Kalyanasundaram et al. 1994; Brown & Herbert 1997).
 It is not as effective as DEET (Curtis et al. 1990; Kalyanasundaram et al. 1994; Kumar et al. 1995; Brown & Herbert 1997) and, consequently, is not often used in present-day insect repellents.
 A commercial product (Dimp, Sterling Pharmaceuticals (N.Z.), Auckland), containing 31.7% DMP, claimed protection from insect bites for 3?4 hours.
 DMP has been used as an invertebrate antifeedant in baits used for trapping small mammals.
 A sugar syrup bait containing 2% DMP was not repellent to honeybees (Morgan et al.
   The acute oral LD50 of DMP to Norway rats is 8200 mg/kg (Tomlin 1994).
 The palatability of DMP to possums and rodents is unknown.
 However, in 2-year feeding trials, rats receiving 20 000 mg/kg diet suffered no ill effects (Tomlin 1994).
 A concentration of 4% DMP did not deter rodents from entering traps (Anderson & Ohmart 1977), but the palatability of DMP to these rodents was not known because they did not have to eat the baits.
  DMP is readily available, and may be obtained from Global Science & Technology for NZ$116.50/litre.
  Eucalyptus oil is an essential oil of Eucalyptus species.
 Its chief constituent is eucalyptol (cineole), a colourless liquid, with a camphor-like odour, and spicy, cooling taste (Budavari 1996).
 The active ingredients have been described as eucamalol (Satoh et al. 1995), p-methane-3,8-diol (Trigg 1996a, 1996b; Trigg & Hill 1996), or pinene, cymene, and eucalyptol (Lin 1998).
 The major component of eucalyptus oil is usually eucalyptol if the yield is moderate to high, or pinene if it is low (Boland & Brophy 1993; Thorsell et al. 1998).
 The boiling point of eucalyptol is 176?177�C, and a-pinene is 155?156�C (Budavari 1996).
  Eucalyptus oil has been used as an invertebrate antifeedant, mainly as a repellent against biting insects (Watanabe et al. 1993; Trigg 1996a, 1996b; Trigg & Hill 1996; Chou et al. 1997; Thorsell et al. 1998).
 The effectiveness of eucalyptus oil may vary with the species from which it is derived, although the results may be conflicting.
 For example, Yan & Tan (1998) found that oil from E. citriodora was more effective than that from E. globulus against sawyers (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), whereas Lin (1998) found that oil from E. globulus was more effective than that from E. citriodora against termites.
 Trade names of products containing eucalyptus oil include Mosiguard Natural, which contains 50% eucalyptus oil (Trigg 1996a, 1996b; Trigg & Hill 1996), and Buzz Away, which also contains citronella (Chou et al. 1997).
 In some cases, eucalyptus-based repellents were as effective as DEET (Satoh et al. 1995; Trigg 1996a, 1996b; Thorsell et al.
 1998) and in other cases not as effective (Collins et al. 1993; Mumcuoglu et al. 1996; Chou 1997).
 When used on humans as an insect repellent, eucalyptus-based products gave protection from biting invertebrates for about 8 hours (Trigg 1996a, 1996b; Trigg & Hill 1996; Thorsell et al. 1998).
 When applied to clothing, the repellency was extended to at least 8 days (Mumcuoglu et al. 1996).
 Solvent extracts of dried leaves may have longer repellency than the essential oil (Khan & Shahjahan 1998).
 Science for Conservation 232 19 19
 When added to sugar syrup, 1% eucalyptus oil reduced the number of Indian honeybees (Apis cerana indica) collecting syrup for only 6 hours, compared with 30 hours for 1% citronella oil (Patayal & Kumar 1989).
 When applied to host plants, 10% E.
 citriodora oil repelled three species of sawyers for 4?12 days, and 0.6% repelled them for 1?11 days (Yan & Tan 1998).
 A concentration of 2% eucalyptus oil on filter paper and wood flour repelled termites, but concentrations of less than 0.25% had virtually no termite repellency (Lin 1998).
 Sugar syrup containing 2% a-pinene, a component of eucalyptus oil, was not repellent to honeybees (Morgan et al. 1993).
  The palatability of eucalyptus oil to possums and rodents is unknown.
 However, possums eat eucalyptus leaves containing eucalyptus oil.
 Eucalyptus oil is readily available, and may be obtained from Bush Boake Allen for NZ$42.02/kg + GST, and from Essential Oils of New Zealand for $100/litre + GST.
 Eucalyptol (cineole) is obtainable from Sigma Chemical Company for A$36.00/100 ml (Sigma 2000).
  Muzigadial, like ugandensidial and warburganal, is a sesquiterpene derived from Warburgia species (Warthen & Morgan 1990).
  Muzigadial is one of the most potent invertebrate antifeedants identified, being active at 0.1 ppm on Spodoptera species (Warthen & Morgan 1990).
  The palatabili
 Muzigadial has not been commercialised and is not readily available.
  Neem oil is derived from the seeds and leaves of the Indian neem tree (Azadirachta indica) and other species of the family Meliaceae.
 The major component of neem oil is azadirachtin.
 It also contains several othercompounds, including azadiradion, isovepaol, meliantriol, nimbidin, salannin, and vepaol (Nigam et al. 1994; Mulla & Su 1999).
 It is a yellow oil, with a garlic odour, and bitter taste (Budavari 1996).
 Azadirachtin powder has a melting point of 154?158�C.
 The antifeedant activity of azadirachtin varies with extracts from different geographic regions and ecological conditions (Jermy 1990; Mulla & Su 1999).
 When feeding does occur, azadirachtin may have insecticidal properties (Mordue & Blackwell 1993; Mulla & Su 1999).
 Several other neem compounds (e.g. nimbin and azadirone) also show strong antifeedant activity, comparable to that of azadirachtin, but with virtually no toxicity (Aerts & Mordue 1997).
 Neem extracts were slightly more active than pure azadirachtin at equivalent azadirachtin concentrations, indicating that azadirachtin is not the only active ingredient in neem (Xie et al.1995).
  Lepidoptera are extremely sensitive to azadirachtin and show effective antifeedancy from < 1 to 50 ppm.
  Topical applications of neem are effective for only 4?8 days, because azaridachtin breaks down in sunlight (Mordue & Blackwell 1993).
 Neem has proved more effective in protecting stored grain, where the protection may last for ?a number of months?
 Increasing concentrations of 0.5?4% neem oil showed increasing repellency to larvae of Spodoptera litura on urd bean (Vigna mungo) leaves (Venkateswarlu et al.
 A concentration of 8% neem oil was completely repellent.
 A concentration of 10% NeemAzal (containing 20% azadirachtin) reduced food consumption by larval American cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) by 60% and by adult female cockroaches by 75% (Richter et al.
 Neem oil has been used as an insect repellent on humans.
 For example, 1?4% neem oil in coconut oil applied to exposed body parts of human volunteers gave up to 100% protection from Anopheles mosquito bites for 12 hours (Sharma et al.
 1993, 1995; Mishra et al. 1995).
 Neemos (containing azadirachtin and citronella) provided protection from Anopheles mosquitoes for 8 hours (Caraballo 2000).
 A concentration of 2% neem oil in coconut oil gave 100% protection against Phlebotomus sandflies throughout the night (Sharma & Dhiman 1993).
  Neem-based products are available on the market in a number of countries under trade names such as Azatin, Bioneem, Margosan-O, Neemark, NeemAzal, Neemesis, Neemgard, Neemos, Neemrich, Nimbosol, Repelin, Safer?s ENI, and Wellgro (Mordue & Blackwell 1993; Nigam et al.
  Neemos also contains citronella (Caraballo 2000).
 Trade names available in New Zealand include NEEM 900 EC (containing at least 1500 ppm azadirachtin).
 The biological activity of neem preparations is closely related to their azadirachtin content (Warthen & Morgan 1990; Mordue & Blackwell 1993; Xie et al.
  Azadirachtin cannot be exploited commercially because of its large and complex chemical structure, which is both difficult and expensive to synthesise (Jain & Tripathi 1993; Mordue & Blackwell 1993; Srivastava et al.
  However, several isomers have been synthesised (Ley 1990 in Russell & Lane 1993).
 A readily synthesised tricylic furan that forms part of the azadirachtin structure is as deterrent to Spodoptera littoralis as azadirachtin (Blaney et al.
  Vertebrate activity eem products are relatively safe to mammals and humans (Mulla & Su 1999).
 The acute oral LD50 of azadirachtin is > 5000 mg/kg for Norway rats (Tomlin 1994).
 Neem was repellent to starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) (Mason & Matthew 1996) and three species of Kenyan rodents (Lemniscomys striatus, Mastomys natalensis, and Arvicanthis niloticus) (Oguge et al.
  However, a commercial preparation of neem (Plasma Power P, India, containing at least 0.15% azadirachtin) applied at 2% on carrot baits (at least 0.003% azadirachtin) was not repellent to brushtail possums or laboratory Norway rats in a choice trial in New Zealand (T.D.
  Neem oil is readily available and very cheap (Ascher 1992).
 In New Zealand it is available from Suntec (NZ) as NEEM 900 EC (containing at least 0.15% azadirachtin) for NZ$24/litre.
 However, azadirachtin is extremely expensive (A$72.50 for 500 �g in the Sigma 2000 catalogue).
  Permethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid, more stable to light and at least as active as natural pyrethrins (Budavari 1996).
 It is not as light-stable as other synthetic pyrethroids (e.g. cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and fenpropathrin).
 It is a yellowbrown liquid with a boiling point of > 290�C (Tomlin 1994).
  Permethrin is both an insecticide and an insect repellent (Brown & Herbert 1997; Cockcroft et al. 1998).
 It is effective against a wide range of invertebrates including lice, ticks, fleas, mites, mosquitoes, and black flies (Brown & Herbert 1997).
 Permethrin is marketed in the USA as an insect repellent for human use, both as a cream and as an aerosol spray.
 It can be applied to the skin (1?5% in a cream), or sprayed on clothing, tents, netting, etc.
 It is effective for longer when 22 Spurr & McGregor?Potential invertebrate antifeedants applied to clothing than to skin.
 In a laboratory trial, permethrin was not as repellent to mosquites as DEET, but another pyrethroid (Pyrethroid-T, containing the alpha-cyano, 3-phenoxybenzyl moiety) was more repellent than DEET (Braverman & Chizov-Ginzburg 1997).
 Permethrin is not as repellent as cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and fenpropathrin (Thomson 1982).
 Permethrin applied as a 0.015% spray reduced visits by Indian honeybees (Apis cerana indica) to radish crops for up to 8 days (Rathore et al. 1987).
 Baits treated with 0.04% permethrin repelled chrysomelid beetles (Diabrotica speciosa) for up to 14 days (Roel & Zatarin 1989).
 Apple paste bait containing 0.5% Ambush� 50 EC, a commercial formulation containing 5% permethrin (i.e. 0.025% permethrin in the bait) was repellent to honeybees, but also to brushtail possums (Morgan et al. 1993).
 However, emulsifiable concentrates often include aromatics that could make them unpalatable to possums.
 Vertebrate activity The acute oral LD50 of technical permethrin to Norway rats is 430?4000 mg/kg (Tomlin 1994).
 The palatability of technical permethrin to possums and rodents is unknown.
 However, in 2-year feeding trials, rats receiving 100 mg/kg diet showed no ill effects (Tomlin 1994), implying that permethrin is palatable to rats at that concentration.
 Availability Permethrin is readily available.
 Pine oil is extracted from certain Pinus species.
 It is a colourless to pale yellow liquid, with a turpentine-like odour.
 It has a boiling point of 200?220�C (Budavari 1996).
 Pine oil has invertebrate antifeedant properties.
 For example, oil from Pinus sylvestris was almost as repellent as DEET to ticks (Ixodes persulcatus) (Dobrotvorskii et al. 1989).
 Pine oil (unspecified) protected spruce (Picea abies) logs from attack by the striped ambrosia beetle (Trypodendron lineatum) (Coleoptera:
 Scolytidae) (Dubbel 1992), but did not protect Pinus taeda, P. echinata, or P. virginiana from attack by southern pine beetles (Dendroctonus frontalis), black turpentine beetles (D. terebrans), or Ips grandicollis (Nord et al. 1990).
 This latter result is not surprising because pines are the natural hosts of these beetles.
 Pine oil also repels mosquitoes Aedes spp.) (Thorsell et al. 1998), house flies (Musca domestica) (Mananga et al. 1996), and onion maggots (Delia antiqua) (Ntiamoah et al. 1996).
  Pine oil is unpalatable to at least some rodents.
 Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica) needle oil reduced food consumption by deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) (Wager-Page et al. 1997).
 However, the palatability of pine oil to possums and the rodent species present in New Zealand is unknown.

  Polygodial is a drimane sesquiterpenoid originally isolated from the waterpepper plant, Polygonum hydropiper.
 It has subsequently been isolated from several plant genera, including Warburgia species (Norris 1986; Warthen & Morgan 1990) and the New Zealand native horopito (Pseudowintera colorata) (Gerard et al.1992).
  Polygodial has been used experimentally in the UK to protect barley from the bird-cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, a transmitter of barley yellow dwarf virus (Warthen & Morgan 1990; Jain & Tripathi 1993; Pickett et al.
  However, it caused reduced feeding by the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) on potato leaf discs (Gols et al. 1996), and in New Zealand had antifeedant activity against the Australian carpet beetle (Anthrenocerus australis) at a concentration as low as 0.04% wool weight (Gerard et al. 1992).
 It also had both antifeedant and insecticidal activity against a lepidopteran, the webbing clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella) (Gerard et al.1992).
  The palatability of polygodial to possums and rodents is unknown.
  Polygodial has not been commercially developed, and is not readily available.
  Pyrethrum is a natural oil extract from the flowers of Chrysanthemum species, and contains a mixture of natural pyrethrins (Curtis et al.
 1990; Tomlin 1994; Budavari 1996).
  Pyrethrum has been used as an indoor fumigant in the form of smoke or sprays for mosquito control.
 Powder formulations were once common both in domestic and agricultural use (Curtis et al. 1990).
 As well as being insecticidal, pyrethrum flushes invertebrates out from their hiding places.
 It was a more effective flushing agent against cockroaches than were synthetic pyrethroids such as cypermethrin and permethrin (Fuchs 1988).
 However, pyrethrum has little residual effect, and has largely been replaced by more effective synthetic chemicals (Curtis et al. 1990).
   The acute oral LD50 of pyrethrum to Norway rats is 1030?2370 mg/kg (Tomlin 1994).
 The palatability of pyrethrum to possums and rodents is unknown.
  Pyrethrum is readily available.
  Ugandensidial is a terpenoid derived from Warburgia ugandensis and other Warburgia species (Norris 1986; Warthen & Morgan 1990).
 It is active on Spodoptera species at 0.1 ppm (Warthen & Morgan 1990).
 However, it has not been commercially developed, and is not readily available.
  Warburganal Warburganal is a terpenoid derived from Warburgia species (Norris 1986; Warthen & Morgan 1990).
 It is twice as potent as azadirachtin (from neem oil) to Spodoptera exempta (Norris 1986; Warthen & Morgan 1990).
 However, it has not been commercially developed, and is not readily available.
  There are many other compounds also identified in the literature as invertebrate antifeedants (e.g.
 see Norris 1990; Warthen & Morgan 1990), too many to list within the constraints of the budget for this paper.
 For example, essential oils with insect repellent properties, other than those listed above, include bay, bergamot, cassia, clove, geranium, laurel, lavender, pennyroyal, peppermint, thyme, and wintergreen (Curtis et al.
 There are also many fungicides, acaricides, insecticides, and herbicides that are antifeedant to invertebrates (Ascher 1979; Thomson 1982; Hare & Moore 1988).
 Compounds discussed in section 3.3 (above) and with antifeedant activity against these taxa are grouped by invertebrate taxon in Table 1.
 No references were found to antifeedants for amphipods, harvestmen, millipedes, springtails, or earwigs.
 Science for Conservation 232 25 25
  Potential invertebrate antifeedants that could be added to baits used for vertebrate pest control that meet at least some of the criteria required include DEET, DMP, citronella oil, eucalyptus oil, neem oil, and alpha-cypermethrin.
 These are antifeedant to a broad spectrum of invertebrates, active at low concentrations, relatively low cost, and readily available.
 DEET is claimed to be the most effective insect repellent developed so far for human use (Brown & Herbert 1997; Chou et al.
 DMP, citronella oil, and eucalyptus oil are also insect repellents for human use.
 DMP has been also used as an invertebrate antifeedant in baits for small mammal trapping in the USA (Anderson & Ohmart 1977).
 Neem oil contains azadirachtin, claimed to be one of the most potent invertebrate antifeedants yet discovered (Jain & Tripathi 1 A synthesised analogue of cinnamon oil INVERTEBRATE ANTIFEEDANT REFERENCES GROUP Mites (Acarina) Alpha-cypermethrin Ahn et al.
  1999 Citrus oil Ho & Fauziah 1993 Cypermethrin Cohen & Joseph 1992 Diethyl toluamide (DEET) Ho & Fauziah 1993 Neem Mansour et al.

 1997 Permethrin Fuchs 1988 Pyrethrum Fuchs 1988 Orthoptera Cinnamon oil Spurr & Drew 1999 (including weta) Neem Mordue & Blackwell 1993 Beetles (Coleoptera) Camphor Miles et al.
  Alpha-cypermethrin is a known invertebrate antifeedant, and is believed to be used as such in a commercially available rat bait.
 Of the other potential invertebrate antifeedants, cinnamon oil (0.1?0.5%) is already added to baits used for possum control, to mask the smell and taste of 1080 to possums (Morgan 1990), although it is not added to baits used for rodent control (W.
  Cinnamon oil (0.1%) reduced the incidence of invertebrates feeding on baits by more than 50% for at least 3 days (Spurr & Drew 1999).
 A higher concentration of cinnamon oil (e.g.
 0.3%) may reduce the incidence of invertebrates on baits even more, but may also reduce the palatability of baits to rats (Landcare Research, unpubl.data).
 However, a more effective invertebrate antifeedant is desired.
 Permethrin and cypermethrin are considered to be not as repellent as alpha-cypermethrin.
 Muzigadial, polygodial, ugandensidial, and warburganal are potent antifeedantsagainst some invertebrates.
 However, they are not readily available and the likely cost of obtaining quantities sufficient for poisoning operations makes them impractical for this purpose.
 Capsaicin and cinnamamide are repellent to mammals, and would likely make baits unpalatable to possums and rats.
 AgResearch (Hamilton) is developing a bird repellent that is palatable to possums and rats (T.
  Its composition has yet to be finalised, so it is not yet ready for testing against invertebrates.
 The likely length of effectiveness of potential antifeedants to invertebrates is also difficult to estimate.
 The effectiveness of DEET, DMP, essential oils, and synthetic pyrethroids may be quite short-lived (a few hours), but formulation in a bait may increase their longevity (to several days).
 Invertebrate antifeedants are needed in toxic baits for as long as they remain available to invertebrates.
 For baits in bait stations, this could be several months.
 There is little evidence available to identify what concentrations of invertebrate antifeedants should be added to baits used for vertebrate pest control.
 DEET is used in most insect repellents at concentrations of 20?30%, and in some at concentrations as low as 6%.
 DMP is also used in insect repellents at 20?30%, but was incorporated into baits used for trapping small mammals at 4% (Anderson & Ohmart 1977).
 Essential oils such as citronella and eucalyptus have been found to be feeding deterrents for Indian honeybees at 0.5?1% (Patayal & Kumar 1989).
 Neem oil has generally been used for protection of stored grain at 0.1?2% (Mordue & Blackwell 1993; Nigam et al.1994).
 Permethrin, cypermethrin, and alpha-cypermethrin have generally been found to be deterrent to invertebrates at 0.02% to 0.2% (Roel & Zatarin 1989; Fisk & Wright 1992; Terekhova 1995).
 The amount of invertebrate antifeedants that occur as liquids that can be added to baits used for vertebrate pest control is potentially restricted by the amount of liquid that can be absorbed by the baits.
 For cereal-based baits manufactured by Animal Control Products this is 2% (W. Simmons, ACP, pers. comm.).
 DEET, DMP, the essential oils, and commercially available formulations of alphacypermethrin all occur as liquids, although DEET can also be obtained in powder form.
 Thus, the maximum concentration of these compounds that can be added to cereal-based baits is 2%.
 This restriction is not present for invertebrate antifeedants (e.g. technical-grade alpha-cypermethrin) that are available as powders.
  Currently, the main unknown in selecting potential invertebrate antifeedants for adding to baits used for vertebrate pest control is their palatability to possums and rats.
 This needs to be determined before invertebrate antifeedants can be used to prevent toxicants being transported into the environment by invertebrates.
 In vertebrate pest control operations using bait stations, an alternative to to
 incorporating invertebrate antifeedants into baits is to apply an insect repellent (such as in aerosol fly sprays or slow-release polymer strips) to the bait stations.
 This has the advantage that the compound would not have to be palatable to possums and rodents, although it would have to be non-repellent to them.
 Some research would be necessary to identify the best invertebrate repellent to use, both for acceptability to possums and rodents and for effectiveness against invertebrates.
 However, in the interim, this strategy could be implemented immediately in a research-by-management programme, using any commercially available fly spray or insect repellent polymer strip, with possible immediate conservation gains.
  The following potential invertebrate antifeedants should be evaluated for palatability to possums and rats:
 DEET, DMP, citronella oil, eucalyptus oil, neem oil, and alpha-cypermethrin.
 Commercially available insect repellents (such as in aerosol fly sprays or slow-release polymer strips) should also be evaluated for use in bait stations to reduce invertebrate consumption of baits there.
  Neem oil is pressed from the seed of the neem tree (Azadiracta indica).
 This tree, native to eastern India and Burma, is known by several names including "village pharmacy," "cornucopia," "wonder tree," and "the veritable gold mine." Neem leaves, stems, seeds and oil have been used for medicinal purposes and pest control in India for more than 4,000 years.
 In fact, its Sanskrit name, arishta, means "reliever of sickness." sickness."
  Because neem products are used for human consumption and medication, exposure to neem in the process of treating plants with neem oil poses no threat to humans or other higher animals.
 Moreover, neem is not harmful to beneficial insects, affecting only those insects feeding on plants treated with neem.
 Since most predator insects do not also feed on plants, they are not harmed by the presence of neem.
 Neem biodegrades in a matter of weeks when exposed to sunlight or in soil.
 In EPA testing, establishment of an LD-50 proved impossible as azadirachtin, one of numerous organic compounds present in neem oil, was asymptomatic at all levels tested.
 Accordingly, there are no reentry or residual restrictions associated with the use of neem oil.
  Numerous tests have shown neem oil to be effective as an insecticide, miticide, fungicide, nematacide, and as an insect antifeedant and repellant.
 An insect antifeedant is a substance that discourages insect feeding but does not directly kill the insect.
 Azadirachtin is a potent insect antifeedant and disrupts the molting cycle of the ingesting insect leading to its death.
 As an antifeedant, neem oil is so effective that in tests desert locusts, voracious herbivores, will starve to death before eating plants treated with neem oil.
 Insects rapidly evolve, developing resistance to conventional pesticides which directly and nonselectively kill them.
 As a result, existing chemical insecticides are becoming less effective for the control of the pests.
 Moreover, widespread use of chemical insecticides indiscriminately kills both harmful and beneficial insects creating the need to use more pesticides! Because neem extracts disrupt the growth of insects in a variety of ways, insects are not likely to develop resistance to neem insecticides.
 Naturally occurring compounds in neem have been shown to be an effective antifeedant and growth regulator for more than 200 species of insect pests and yet are surprisingly nontoxic to birds, mammals and beneficial predators like ladybugs, spiders, bees & wasps.
 In addition to the above-mentioned effects, neem inhibits normal insect mating, oviposition and larval development as well as reducing female fertility.
 These effects reduce the risk of harm to beneficial insects, birds and other predators, which prey on harmful insects.
 Neem's antifeedant properties even effect snails.
 Neem extracts inhibit the action of denitrifying bacteria in the ground which reduce nitrate, ammonia and urea to molecular nitrogen (N2) and nitrous oxide, both volatile gasses.
 In the absence of controls, the action of these bacteria result in not only the loss of an important macronutrient, nitrogen, from the soil but also in the release of ozone depleting, greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
 Neem extracts have shown incredible success in combating not only fungal problems on leaves but also many forms of root rot.
 Neem is effective in both contact and systemic roles.
 Accordingly, for optimum benefits it should be sprayed on all sides of foliage and watered into the root zone.
 Implementation of environmentally friendly horticultural practices is essential to the preservation of the quality of life on Earth.
 Ecologically sound practices which rely less upon synthetic chemical pesticides and more upon integrated pest management (IPM) practices including the use of naturally occurring pest controls like neem oil are imperative to maintain soil productivity and reduce ancillary poisoning of people and animals.
 For more-extensive discussions on neem see the website for the Neem Foundation at or the Neem Association at other websites which cite scientific research and anecdotal information on the benefits of neem for both human and plant health.

 Antifeedants are aversive chemical compounds that suppress feeding over a varying time period of observation.
 Some antifeedants inhibit feasting because they are poisonous, others because they possess a regretful sense of taste.
 These molecules are of exceptional involvement because they could be used to defend our crops.
 They might also foreclose insects to lay down eggs.
 These chemicals are only to prevent noxious insects from feeding but also move them away from the crops.
 The antifeedants manufactured by us are classified into two main heads:
 Chemical based antifeedants and Organic based antifeedants.
 Chlordimeform Chlordimeform
 Chlordimeform is effective as an insecticide for controlling bollworm and tobacco budworm in cotton and other crops.
 It is also beneficial and extremely effective for the control of resistant mites and their eggs.
 This product has exceptionally good ovicidal action.
 Chlordimeform is more effective on mite eggs and larvae than the adults.
 It requires a time period of 24-96 hours for mite control.
 Pymetrozine Pymetrozine
 Pymetrozine are the chemicals used in the formation of Antifeedants to control organisms which are regarded as harmful.
 This compound helps to save farmers money by forbidding crop releases to insects and other pests.
 They can also kill trespassing weeds in parklands and wild areas which may cause environmental impairment.

 Description:CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS APPLICATIONS
 This application claims benefits from U.S. the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
 This invention relates broadly to insect repellents, antifeedants and pesticides.
 More particularly, this invention relates to extended time release compositions and methods for repelling insects over an extended time.
 The invention has particular application to the repelling of the �red imported fire ant� Solenopsis invicta Buren, although it is not limited thereto.
  The use of repellent composition materials such as GERANIOL COEUR (a trademark of International Flavors and Fragrances Inc.) to repel �red imported fire ants� (RIFA) is well known, and such compositions are commonly used for repelling insects and acting as antifeedants.
 Geraniol is volatile, however, and must be replenished frequently, or the insect repellant loses its potency.
 In an effort to extend the potency life of the insect repellency, geraniol has been combined with compatible carrier polymers such as high density polyethylene and low density polyethylene to form geraniol infused polyethylene pellets.
  The advantages of this composition are improved handling and a greater length of time over which the pesticide/repellent is released under typical ambient conditions.
  The present invention provides extended time release compositions and methods for repelling insects over an extended time.
 The present invention also provides insect repellent compositions which have an extended life efficacy at elevated temperatures.
 The present invention also provides long-lasting insect repellent compositions which are 25b EPA exempt.
 According to one aspect of the invention, an insect repellent composition includes a polymer into which both a zeolite (molecular sieve material) and an insect repellent are incorporated.
 According to another aspect of the invention, the zeolite (molecular sieve material) and the insect repellent are matched so that the pore size of the zeolite (molecular sieve) is large enough to contain molecules of the insect repellent compound.
 For purposes of this application the terms �zeolite� and �molecular sieve� or �molecular sieve material� will be used interchangeably and are to be defined and understood to have the same meaning (i.e., a material containing tiny pores of generally precise and uniform size such that molecules small enough to pass through the pores are adsorbed while larger molecules are not), regardless of whether the zeolite or molecular sieve is a natural substance or a man-made substance.
 In one embodiment, the insect repellent composition comprises a high density polyethylene, geraniol, and a molecular sieve which includes one or both of silicon oxide and aluminum oxide powder.
 According to another embodiment, an insect repellent is formed into pellets, pucks, or blocks having an approximate mixture of 30% insect repellent, 15% molecular sieve material, and 55% polymer by weight.
 According to another aspect of the invention, an insect repellent composition having a polymer, a molecular sieve material, and an insect repellent is formed by co-extruding the ingredients.
 The co-extruded ingredients may be formed as pellets, ropes or strips, or molded into pucks or blocks of material, with the insect repellent being absorbed into the polymer matrix and the molecular sieve material.
 According to further aspect of the invention, the extrusion process is performed at a temperature above the melting point of the polymer and at a sufficient pressure to keep the insect repellent from evaporating.
 According to yet another aspect of the invention, an insect repellent block formed from a polymer, an insect repellent, and a molecular sieve material and less than one cubic foot in volume is provided.
 The insect repellent block is placed in an electrical box which is subject to outdoor conditions and which regularly reaches temperatures exceeding 120� F., and generates insect repellent vapors for an extended period of approximately at least one year in sufficient quantities to repel target insects and prevent the insects from feeding on electrical wires, building nests or damaging the electronic equipment in the box.
 Additional advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reference to the detailed description taken in conjunction with the provided figures.
 1 is a perspective view of a block of the product of the invention.
  2 is a graph of evaporation test results comparing the prior art with the composition of the invention.
  In accord with a preferred embodiment of the invention, an improved extended time release, geraniol based, 25b EPA exempt repellent composition is provided which is also believed to act as an antifeedant and pesticide.
 The composition is effective in repelling the RIFA (�red imported fire ant�) Solenopsis invicta Buren, and it is believed to be effective in repelling other insects as well.
 The preferred composition is comprised of polyethylene, a zeolite typically incorporating one or both of silicon oxide and aluminum oxide (e.g., an aluminosilicate), and geraniol.
 As set forth above, the word �zeolite� will be used interchangeably with �molecular sieve� and is to be understood to have the same meaning, regardless of whether the zeolite/molecular sieve is a natural substance or an man-made substance.
 More particularly, in a presently preferred embodiment, high density polyethylene, a molecular sieve material having a unit cell size AO (i.e., vertex to vertex distance) of 24.29 �, and a pore size of roughly 7.4 � and sold as SA-15 PWD (a product of UOP�a Honeywell Company), and geraniol (available from International Flavors and Fragrances) are co-extruded and optionally molded as hereinafter described to generate a a mass of repellent material.
 For purposes herein the term �mass� of repellent material will be defined to include repellent material formed into any size or shape such as pellets (generally small and oval, round or bullet shaped), ropes, strips, pucks (generally molded into a cylindrical shape), and blocks (generally molded into a desired shape).
 The relative weights of the ingredients in the composition of the preferred embodiment are approximately:
 25%-30% geraniol, 10%-15% molecular sieve material, and 65%-55% high density polyethylene.
 In the presently preferred embodiment, the composition is formed by taking the high density polyethylene, the molecular sieve material, and the geraniol and extruding them in an extruder such as the Buss Co.
  More particular, the high density polyethylene is heated above its melting point (e.g., between 220� F.
 and 250� F.), and added to the main hopper feeder.
 The geraniol is added through a downstream injection pin at a sufficiently high pressure to prevent the geraniol from evaporating during extrusion.
 The molecular sieve material is added through a downstream slide feeder.
 The operating temperature along the length of the extruder is typically between 280� F.
  The resulting co-extruded product is then cooled with the geraniol being contained in the polymer matrix and in the molecular sieve material (which is mixed with the polymer).
 In one embodiment, the co-extruded product is pelletized using e.g., a Gala Underwater Pelletizer.
 Regardless of whether the product is pelletized or not, the coextruded product is optionally molded into blocks using a molder (e.g., an Arburg or Toshiba Molder) which can have multiple heating zones.
 Once formed into its desired shape, the mass of repellent material is preferably wrapped in cellophane, a vapor bag, or is placed in a container to prevent escape of the geraniol from the mass.
 According to another embodiment, rather than co-extruding the high density polyethylene, the molecular sieve material, and the geraniol as described above, the molecular sieve material and the geraniol are first mixed such that the geraniol is at least partially adsorbed in the molecular sieve material.
 The resulting mixture or slurry may then be co-extruding or mixed in a batch process with the melted polyethylene in a sufficiently high pressure environment to prevent the geraniol from evaporating during the procedure.
 The resulting material is then formed into a desired shape (e.g., pellets, rope, strip, puck, or block) and size and cooled.
 The resulting repellent mass is then preferably wrapped in cellophane a vapor bag, or is placed in a container to prevent escape of the geraniol from the mass.
 It will be appreciated that where the geraniol is completely adsorbed by the molecular sieve material during co-extrusion with the melted polyethylene (or during pre-mixing), the melted polyethylene will act as a carrier for the molecular sieve material which holds the geraniol and will not separately carry the geraniol (although, of course, as geraniol leaves the molecular sieve material it will migrate through the polyethylene).
 However, where the amount of geraniol exceeds the capacity of the molecular sieve material to adsorb all of the geraniol, the melted polyethylene will not only carry the molecular sieve material which has adsorbed geraniol, but will also separately carry the geraniol.
 As a result, as will be described hereinafter, when the geraniol is totally adsorbed in the molecular sieve, the rate of release of geraniol will remain relatively constant, whereas, when the geraniol is both adsorbed by the molecular sieve and separately contained in the polyethylene, geraniol will be released initially at a much higher rate, and then the rate of release will slow and remain relatively constant.
 More particularly, the puck 10 of FIG.
 1 is a molded block having a beer barrel shape with top and bottom diameters of approximately 1.25 inches, a center diameter of 1.5 inches, a height of 1.25 inches (for a total volume of between 2 and 3 cubic inches), and weighing approximately 36 grams.
 The puck 10 has a series of 1/16 inch protruding nubs 12 at the top and bottom surfaces and around the periphery of the center line which minimize surface contact and enable unhindered flow of active ingredient out of the block.
 It should be appreciated that the molecular sieve material significantly increases the amount of liquid geraniol which can be added to the polymer and retained therein.
 In particular, without the molecular sieve material, the amount of liquid geraniol that is readily added to high density polyethylene is approximately 20% by weight of the geraniol-polyethylene mixture.
 By adding 10% by weight of the SA-15 PWD molecular sieve material, the molecular sieve itself can optimally adsorb about 10% by weight of the geraniol, and therefore the amount of liquid geraniol that can be added to the compound increases to approximately 26% by weight of the geraniol-molecular sieve-polyethylene mixture (as the polyethylene will itself be able to hold a little less due to its decreased amount in the compound).
 By adding 15% by weight of molecular sieve material, the amount of liquid geraniol that can be added increases to approximately 29% by weight of the geraniol-molecular sieve-polyethylene mixture.
 In some cases, it may be possible to provide a molecular sieve material which constitutes 25% by weight of the composition, and in such cases, the amount of geraniol that can be added could increase to approximately 35%.
 Thus, by adding the molecular sieve material to the polyethylene, the polyethylene and molecular sieve material can be loaded with significantly more geraniol.
 In addition, because the molecular sieve material is believed to reduce the essential oil vapor pressure of the geraniol as the energy state of the geraniol is reduced as it enters the cage structure of the molecular sieve, the rate of evaporation of the geraniol from the repellent material is reduced, thereby extending the product life and repellent efficacy of the composition.
 2 is a graph which shows the reduced rate of evaporation of geraniol from a composition comprised of the geraniol, high density polyethylene, and the SA-15 PWD molecular sieve material, relative to the evaporation of geraniol from a repellent material containing geraniol and polyethylene and no molecular sieve material.
 More particularly, five blocks of repellent material were made, each half in thick, two inches long and one inch wide.
 Blocks 1, 2, and 3 were made out of high density polyethylene loaded with 20% by weight geraniol and weighed 16.7 grams.
 Block 4 was made out of high density polyethyelene with 10% by weight SA-15 PWD molecular sieve material and 25% by weight geraniol.
 Block 5 was made out of high density polyethyelene with 15% by weight SA-15 PWD molecular sieve material and 30% by weight geraniol.
 All five blocks were placed in a 125� F.
 oven and tested regularly to see the percent evaporation of the geraniol over time (by removing the blocks and weighing them).
  1, before day 20, 90% of the geraniol in blocks 1, 2, and 3 had already evaporated, and by day 25, 95% of the geraniol in all three blocks had evaporated.
 Thus, by day 25, the repellent material of blocks 1, 2, and 3 contained only approximately 5% of its original geraniol, which constituted about 1% of the block by weight.
 In contrast, by day 20, block 4 retained about 50% of its geraniol and block 5 retained about 45% of its geraniol.
 Thus, at day 20, the geraniol in block 4 constituted about 12.5% (50% of 25%) of the block by weight, and the geraniol in block 5 constituted about 13.5% (45% of 30%) of that block by weight.
 At day 60, block 4 retained about 34% of its geraniol, and block 5 retained about 32% of its geraniol.
 Thus at day 60, the geraniol in block 4 constituted about 8.5% of the block by weight, and the geraniol in block 5 constituted about 9.6% of the block by weight.
 Starting at about day 60 (and certainly at day 90 or day 120), it is seen that each of blocks 4 and 5 lost about 0.04% of their original geraniol per day (about 4% over 100 days).
 Thus, it is believed that had tests continued for another 190 days past the 175 days shown, each block (at 365 days or 1 year) would have retained about 25% of its original geraniol (which in the case of block 4 would be about 7% of the block by weight, and in the case of block 5 would be about 7.5% of the block by weight).
 Similarly, at 2 years, each block would have retained about 10% of its original geraniol, which in the case of block 4 would be about 2.5% of the block by weight, and in the case of block 5 would be about 3% of the block by weight.
 In addition, it is believed that the 0.04% daily geraniol loss is associated almost exclusively with geraniol escaping from the molecular sieve material, as the geraniol contained in the high density polyethylene and not trapped by the molecular sieve would have almost entirely evaporated by day 20 as shown by the data for blocks 1, 2, and 3.
 Therefore, provided a sufficient mass of material is utilized, the continuing 0.04% daily (of original content) geraniol loss will be sufficient to repel insects in limited areas.
 Based on the above, according to a method of the present invention, a repellent block of material containing preferably 25%-30% geraniol, 10%-15% molecular sieve material, and 65%-55% high density polyethylene, and preferably formed by co-extruding in a high pressure environment, is taken (unwrapped when appropriate) and placed in an electrical box which is subject to outdoor conditions and which regularly reaches temperatures exceeding 120� F.
 The repellent block of material is left in the box for at least 180 days, and preferably up to one year, and possibly up to two years or more, and then replaced with another repellent block of material.
 When the repellent block is placed in the box, the geraniol in the repellent block initially quickly, and then slowly evaporates and provides insect repellent vapors in sufficient quantities to repel target insects and prevent the insects from feeding on electrical wires, building nests, and damaging electronic equipment in the box.
 Preferably, the block of material comprises less than one cubic foot of material.
 In certain standard electrical boxes, it has believed that a block (mass) of between 2 and 3 cubic inches of material is sufficient to drive the RIFA out of the box and keep the box clean from RIFA damage over a period of one year.
 While the presently preferred embodiment of the invention in comprises high density polyethylene, a molecular sieve material sold as SA-15 PWD, and geraniol, other embodiments of the invention provide different carrier materials, different molecular sieve materials, and different repellent, antifeedant or pesticide materials.
 More particularly, other polymers such as low density polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, ABS, silicone, polyurethane, and polyvinylchloride could be used instead of high density polyethylene.
 Also, while less preferred, instead of a polymer, other carriers such as cotton or a clay binder could be utilized.
 Similarly, different and/or additional molecular sieves may be used instead of the SA-15 PWD.
 Likewise, other insect repellents, antifeedants, and pesticides may be used instead of or in addition to the geraniol.
 These additional insect repellents, antifeedants and pesticides include (by way of example only) D-limonene, permethrin or permethrin variations, oil of citronella, pyrethrum (from chrysanthemum flowers) or pyrethroids, neem oil, DEET, registered pesticides, and Federal Insecticide Fungicide, Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) EPA 25b registration exempt materials.
 Where an insect repellent, antifeedant or pesticide other than or in addition to geraniol is used, according to one aspect of the invention, the molecular sieve is preferably chosen to match that insect repellent, antifeedant or pesticide.
 More particularly, molecular sieves have specific pore sizes, and different insect repellents, antifeedants and pesticides have different molecule compound sizes.
 It is believed that it is important to match the pore size of the molecular sieve to the molecule size of the insect repellent, antifeedant or pesticide so that at least the active portion of the insect repellent, antifeedant, or pesticide can be adsorbed by the molecular sieve.
 Thus, if a combination is used of insect repellents, antifeedants and/or pesticides having different molecular sizes, more than one molecular sieve material should be used to match respective molecular sizes if the slow release aspect of each of the utilized ingredients is to be maintained.
 If desired, however, it is possible to provide one or more insect repellents, antifeedants, and/or pesticides in the carrier, while maintaining a different insect repellent, antifeedant, and/or pesticide in the molecular sieve.
 It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that while a particular co-extrusion process and a particular batch process were described, there are other manners of combining the molecular sieve and carrier.
 For example, a sieve powder can be mixed with a binder such as clay or alumina.
 The resultant mixture can then formed into a desired shape and heat-treated to obtain structural integrity.
 The repellent can then added to the cooled product and adsorbed by the molecular sieve.
 There have been described and illustrated herein several embodiments of an insect repellent material and a method of making and using the same.
 While particular embodiments of the invention have been described, it is not intended that the invention be limited thereto, as it is intended that the invention be as broad in scope as the art will allow and that the specification be read likewise.
 Thus, while particular carriers, molecular sieves, and insect repellents, antifeedants and pesticides have been disclosed, it will be appreciated that others could be used as well.
 Also, while certain preferred weight percentages for the molecular sieve and the insect repellent were described, it will be appreciated that other percentages could be used.
 With respect to the insect repellent, those percentages preferably, but not necessarily, exceed the maximum percentages that can be infused in the carrier without the molecular sieve.
 Further, while the insect repellent material was described as being formed in pellets, ropes, strips, pucks, or blocks or certain sizes, it will be appreciated that other shapes may be formed and different size units may be manufactured, and that the term �mass� as used herein is intended to encompass the material formed into any shape and size.
 Additionally, while the insect repellent material was described as directed to repelling the RIFA Solenopsis invicta Buren, it will be understood that the insect repellent material could be used to repel or kill other insects.
 Furthermore, while the insect repellent material was described as being placed in electrical boxes which are subject to outdoor conditions and which regularly reach temperatures exceeding 120� F., it will be appreciated that the insect repellent material can be placed in other locations and in boxes where the temperature reaches only 100� F., or only 80� F.
 or does not reach so high, or reaches temperatures higher than 120� F.
  Likewise, while the polyethylene was described as retaining the repellent for twenty days, other polymers could be chosen which might retain repellency for shorter or longer periods of time.
 It will therefore be appreciated by those skilled in the art that yet other modifications could be made to the provided invention without deviating from its spirit and scope as claimed.
 An insecticide is a pesticide used against insects.
 They include ovicides and larvicides used against the eggs and larvae of insects respectively.
 Insecticides are used in agriculture, medicine, industry and the household.
 The use of insecticides is believed to be one of the major factors behind the increase in agricultural productivity in the 20th century. Nearly all insecticides have the potential to significantly alter ecosystems; many are toxic to humans; and others are concentrated in the food chain. needed]
 The classification of insecticides is done in several different ways: needed]
 Systemic insecticides are incorporated by treated plants.
 Insects ingest the insecticide while feeding on the plants.
 Contact insecticides are toxic to insects brought into direct contact.
 Efficacy is often related to the quality of pesticide application, with small droplets (such as aerosols) often improving performance.[2] performance.[2]
 Natural insecticides, such as nicotine, pyrethrum and neem extracts are made by plants as defenses against insects.
 Nicotine based insecticides are still being widely used in the US and Canada though they are barred in the EU.[3] EU.[3]
 Plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs) are insecticidal substances produced by plants after genetic modification.[4] For instance, a gene that codes for a specific Baccilus thuringiensis biocidal protein is introduced into a crop plant's genetic material.
 Then, the plant manufactures the protein.
 Since the biocide is incorporated into the plant, additional applications at least of the same compound, are not required.
 Inorganic insecticides are manufactured with metals and include arsenates, copper compounds and fluorine compounds, which are now seldom used, and sulfur, which is commonly used.
 Organic insecticides are synthetic chemicals which comprise the largest numbers of pesticides available for use today.
 Mode of action�how the pesticide kills or inactivates a pest�is another way of classifying insecticides.
 Mode of action is important in predicting whether an insecticide will be toxic to unrelated species, such as fish, birds and mammals.
  OrganochloridesThe insecticidal properties of the best known representative of this class of insecticides, DDT, was made by the Swiss Scientist Paul M�ller.
 For this discovery, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1948.[5] DDT was introduced on the market in 1944.
 With the rise of the modern chemical industry, it was possible to make chlorinated hydrocarbons.
 DDT works by opening the sodium channels in the nerve cells of the insect.
  OrganophosphatesThe next large class developed was the organophosphates, which bind to acetylcholinesterase and other cholinesterases.
 This results in disruption of nerve impulses, killing the insect or interfering with its ability to carry on normal functions.
 Organophosphate insecticides and chemical warfare nerve agents (such as sarin, tabun, soman and VX) work in the same way.
 Organophosphates have an accumulative toxic effect to wildlife, so multiple exposures to the chemicals amplifies the toxicity.[6] toxicity.[6]
  CarbamatesCarbamate insecticides have similar toxic mechanisms to organophosphates, but have a much shorter duration of action and are thus somewhat less toxic. needed]
  PyrethroidsTo mimic the insecticidal activity of the natural compound pyrethrum another class of pesticides, pyrethroid pesticides, has been developed.
 These are nonpersistent sodium channel modulators, and are much less acutely toxic than organophosphates and carbamates.
 Compounds in this group are often applied against household pests. needed]
  NeonicotinoidsNeonicotinoids are synthetic analogues of the natural insecticide nicotine (with a much lower acute mammalian toxicity and greater field persistence).
 These chemicals are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists.
 Broad-spectrum�systemic insecticides, they have a rapid action (minutes-hours).
 They are applied as sprays, drenches, seed and soil treatments�often as substitutes for organophosphates and carbamates.
 Treated insects exhibit leg tremors, rapid wing motion, stylet withdrawal (aphids), disoriented movement, paralysis and death. needed]
  RyanoidsRyanoids are synthetic chemicals with the same mode of action as ryanodine, a natural insecticide extracted from Ryania speciosa (Flacourtiaceae).
 They bind to calcium channels in cardiac and skeletal muscle, blocking nervous transmission.
 Apparently only one such insecticide is currently registered, Rynaxypyr, generic name chlorantraniliprole [7].
  Insect Growth RegulatorsInsect growth regulators is a term coined to include insect hormone mimics and an earlier class of chemicals, the benzoylphenyl ureas, which inhibit chitin (exoskeleton) biosynthesis in insects.
 Diflubenzuron is a member of the latter class,used primarily to control caterpillars which are pests.
 The most successful insecticides in this class are the juvenoids (juvenile hormone analogues).
 Of these, methoprene is most widely used.
 It has no observable acute toxicity in rats, and is approved by WHO for use in drinking water cisterns to combat malaria.
 Most of its uses are to combat insects where the adult is the pest, including mosquitoes, several fly species, and fleas.
 Two very similar products, hydroprene and kinoprene are used for controlling species such as cockroaches and white flies.
 Methoprene has been registered with the EPA since 1975, and there are virtually no reports of resistance.
 A more recent type of IGR is the ecdysone agonist tebufenozide (MIMIC), which is used in forestry and other applications for control of caterpillars, which are far more sensitive to its hormonal effects than other insect orders.
  Biological insecticidesRecent efforts to reduce broad spectrum toxins added to the environment have brought biological insecticides back into vogue.
 An example is the development and increase in use of Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterial disease of Lepidopterans and some other insects.
 Toxins produced by different strains of this bacterium are used as a larvicide against caterpillars, beetles, and mosquitoes.
 Toxins from Saccharopolyspora spinosa are isolated from fermentations and sold as Spinosad.
 Because these toxins little effect on other organisms, they are considered more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides.
 The toxin from B. thuringiensis (Bt toxin) has been incorporated directly into plants through the use of genetic engineering.
 Other biological insecticides include products based on entomopathogenic fungi (e.g.
 Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae), nematodes (e.g. Steinernema feltiae) and viruses (e.g. Cydia pomonella granulovirus). needed]
  AntifeedantsMany plants have evolved substances, like polygodial, which prevent insects from eating, but do not kill them directly.
 The insect often remains nearby, where it dies of starvation.
 Since antifeedants are nontoxic, they would be ideal as insecticides in agriculture.
 Much agrochemical research is devoted to make them cheap enough for commercial use. needed]
  Environmental effects Effects on nontarget speciesSome insecticides kill or harm other creatures in addition to those they are intended to kill.
 For example, birds may be poisoned when they eat food that was recently sprayed with insecticides or when they mistake insecticide granules on the ground for food and eat it.[6] it.[6]
 Sprayed insecticides may drift from the area to which it is applied and into wildlife areas, especially when it is sprayed aerially.[6] aerially.[6]
  One of the bigger drivers in the development of new insecticides has been the desire to replace toxic and irksome insecticides.
 DDT was introduced as a safer alternative to the lead and arsenic compounds. needed]
 Some insecticides have been banned due to the fact that they are persistent toxins which have adverse effects on animals and/or humans.
 An oft-quoted case is that of DDT, an example of a widely used (and maybe misused) pesticide, which was brought to public attention by Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring.
 One of the better known impacts of DDT is to reduce the thickness of the egg shells on predatory birds.
 The shells sometimes become too thin to be viable, causing reductions in bird populations.
 This occurs with DDT and a number of related compounds due to the process of bioaccumulation, wherein the chemical, due to its stability and fat solubility, accumulates in organisms' fatty tissues.
 Also, DDT may biomagnify, which causes progressively higher concentrations in the body fat of animals farther up the food chain.
 The near-worldwide ban on agricultural use of DDT and related chemicals has allowed some of these birds, such as the peregrine falcon, to recover in recent years.
 A number of the organochlorine pesticides have been banned from most uses worldwide, and globally they are controlled via the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants.
 These include: aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, mirex and toxaphene. needed]
  Pollinator declineInsecticides can kill bees and may be a cause of pollinator decline, the loss of bees that pollinate plants, and colony collapse disorder (CCD),[8] in which worker bees from a beehive or Western honey bee colony abruptly disappear.
 Loss of pollinators will mean a reduction in crop yields.[8] Sublethal doses of insecticides (i.e.
 imidacloprid and other neonicotinoids) affect foraging behavior of bees.[9] However, research into the causes of CCD was inconclusive as of June 2007.[10] 2007.[10]
 Biopesticides have gained prominence as potential plant protecting agents.
 Biological activity of solvent extracts of Catharanthus roseus L (G) Don. were evaluated against larvae of gram pod borer Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).
 Antifeedant and larvicidal activity of methanol crude, petroleum ether, methanol fraction and ethyl acetate fraction of leaf extracts of C. roseus were estimated in the present study.
 Preliminary screening of the extracts was tested at a concentration of 1,000 ppm.
 The larval mortality was observed after 24h of exposure to the extracts.
 All extracts exhibited moderate larvicidal effects.
 However, highest larval mortality was observed in ethyl acetate fraction (4.1, 4.1, 17.4, 42.2, 55.6 and 84.5) of leaf extract of C. roseus, followed by methanol fraction (10.6, 12.7, 26.9, 59.4, 68.3 and 106.7) against the I, II, III, IV, V and VI instar larvae of H. armigera respectively.
 Further, the most active ethyl acetate fraction of C.
 roseus was used to estimate larvicidal activity.
 The results suggest that ethyl acetate fractions of leaf extract of C.
 roseus holds a potential to be used as bio-pesticide for the control of destructive polyphagous agricultural pest - H.
  India is basically an agro-based country; more than 80% of Indian population depends on agriculture.
 Indian economy is largely determined by agricultural productivity.
 Insect-pests are known to cause significant damage to crops and affect agricultural productivity.
 In central and north India, it is the major pest affecting cotton.
 armigera has a long history of resistance to conventional insecticides.
 Variety of chemical insecticides and pesticides are used to control H. armigera.
 However, harmful effects and persistent nature of the chemical pesticides demand for eco-friendly alternatives.
 Economic loss due to this pest in India accounts for 5,000 cores (Manjunath et al., 1985).
 The monetary loss due to feeding by larvae and adult insects alone contributes to billion dollars per annum (Jacobson, 1982).
 Helicoverpa armigera H�bner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a polyphagous pest that infests cotton, tomato, bhendi, chickpea, pigeonpea, chilli, maize, sorghum and many other crops, inflicting substantial crop losses every year (Reed and Pawar, 1982; Manjunath et al., 1989; Sharma, 2001; Talekar et al., 2006).
 However, colonization of new host by H. armigera induces selection of adaptive characters and genetic differentiation in population (Rice, 1987; Diehl and Bush, 1989).
 Larvae of H. armigera feed on the leaves initially and later bore into the pods and seeds with its head thrust into, while rest of the body lies outside.
 Hence, a large number of H. armigera larvae in cotton and other vegetables survive to adults that may disperse widely, producing progeny that damage high-value crops (Cabanillas and Raulston, 1995; Michael and Donald, 1996).
 Since, H. armigera can survive on alternate host it is characterized by high mobility and fecundity.
 Further, it has been reported to develop resistance to synthetic insecticides used in its management (Ramasubramaniam and Regupathy, 2004).
 During the last 50 years, worldwide use of synthetic insecticides to control insect pests has led to both insecticide resistance and environmental persistence (Roush and Tabashnik, 1990).
 Alternatively, phytochemicals have been used in the management of agricultural pest (Choudhary et al., 2001).
 Plant derived pesticides are eco-friendly, non-toxic to non target organisms, non persistent in nature, besides they are lees known to promote drug resistance (Liu et al., 2000).
 Application of bio-pesticides has been reported to have positive impacts on bollworm population management (Ge and Ding 1996; Ramya et al., 2008).
 Therefore, researchers world over are engaged in a mission to hunt for novel phytochemicals that could potentially be used in the management of insect-pests.
 Plants are endowed with a potential to produce a wide range of allelochemicals that protect the plants from insect-pests.
 However, production of phytochemicals has been reported to vary from plant to plant (Ahmad, 2007).
 Further, parameters like age of the plant, part of the plant (root, stem, leaf, fruit, flower, seed and bark) have been reported to affect the production of such allelochemicals.
 The phytochemicals produced in response to insect-pest attack, affect feeding and oviposition of insects on the plants (Ramya et al., 2008).
 A number of plants have been shown to have pesticidal and antifeedant activity against H.
 armigera, of which Neem has been subjected to extensive investigation (Koul, 1985; Chopra et al., 1994; Jaglan et al., 1997; Koul et al., 2000).
 Studies have shown that Acorus calamus, Annona squamosa, Vitex negundo are effective in the management of H. armigera (Murugan et al., 1998; Janardhan et al., 1999).
 Sundararajan and Kumuthakalavalli, (2001) evaluated antifeedant activity of aqueous extract of Gnidia glauca and Toddalia asiatica against H. armigera.
 With this background, in the present study the pesticidal effect of leaf extracts of C. roseus has been evaluated against the larvae of H. armigera. C. roseus (Madagascar periwinkle) belongs to the family Apocynaceae.
 Pharmacological studies have revealed that C. roseus contains more than 70 different types of alkaloids (indole alklaloids) and chemotherapeutic agents (Verpoorte, 1998).
 Also, in vitro studies have shown that this plant produces large number of alkaloids upon elicitation (Verpoorte et al., 2002).
 The enormity of work conducted on this medicinal plant is so large that since 1950s more than 2500 publications have come in, ironically, only handful of data is available with regard to its bio-pesticidal potential.
 Selection of plants was made on the basis of absence of damage by the insect-pest.
 Healthy plant materials were collected in poly bags and brought to lab and their botanical identity was established.
 The Flora of Presidency of Madras (Gamble, 1993) and The Flora of Tamil Nadu Carnatic (Matthew, 1983) were used for authentication of the plants.
 Extraction of phytochemicals using different solvents solvents
 Leaves were collected, washed thoroughly in water, air dried in shade and powdered using a pulverizer and stored in plastic containers.
 The powdered material was weighed and extracted in crude methanol (40-60 %) as solvent in the ratio of 1:10 w/v using Soxhlet apparatus at 55?.
 The crude methanol extract was filtered through a funnel using glass filter and evaporated using a rotary evaporator.
 The residue was re-dissolved in methanol and defatted in equal volume of petroleum ether in a separating funnel.
 The fractions were separated, dried in a rotary evaporator.
 The methanol fraction was further dissolved in ethyl acetate and insoluble derbies were removed by filtration.
 Water soluble materials from the ethyl acetate fraction were removed in a separating funnel using double distilled water.
 The fractions were collected separately and dried.
 Yields in relation to the initial weight of the powder of the different fractions were determined.
 One percent stock solutions of all the fractions in methanol were prepared from the residues obtained at each stage of the purification process and the fractions were tested at different concentrations.
 Test organism:
 The larvae used for the study were collected from the host plants in the fields and brought to lab.
 They were reared on artificial diet under laboratory conditions.
 Studies were carried out using I-VI instar larvae of H. armigera against the leaf extract of C. roseus.
 The percentage mortality was calculated after a period of 24 h.
 Bioassay studies studies
 Bioassay studies were carried out with different fractions of C. roseus leaf extracts against the larvae of H. armigera.
 The studies were conducted (24 h) in the laboratory in transparent plastic containers of 4x2.5 cm size capped with perforated plastic lids.
 Fresh leaves of Gossipium esculentum (Cotton) were collected from the field and washed in clean water.
 Excess moisture was removed and the leaves were dipped in one percent test solution, shade dried and served to the larvae of H. armigera.
 Extract free leaves served as the control.
 For each treatment 10 larvae were singly introduced in separate containers after six hour starvation.
 Three replicates each of ten larvae were maintained for each treatment.
 The experiments were conducted at 27�1?, 75% humidity and 14h dark period.
 Twenty four hour larval mortality was observed and the percentage mortalities were corrected using Abbott�s formula (Abbott, 1925).
 Ethyl acetate fraction of C. roseus was tested for LD50 values against the larval stages of H. armigera.
 Mortality was observed after the completion of the larval stages.
 The fraction which showed high rate of mortality in the least LD50 values was selected for further studies.
 The results of bioassay studies against the larvae of H. armigera in the crude extracts, methanol fractions, petroleum ether fractions and ethyl acetate factions of C. roseus revealed that the LD50 values for the individual fractions of plant extracts varied significantly.
 The least LD50 values ranged from 4.14 to 84.54�g/cm2 for I to VI instars larvae in the ethyl acetate extracts of leaves of C. roseus (Table 1).
 The mortality rate was observed in the decreasing order of ethyl acetate fraction > methanol fraction > methanol crude > petroleum ether.
 The ethyl acetate extracts of C. roseus was found to be more active than other fractions tested.
 Therefore, ethyl acetate extracts of C. roseus were used to determine the ED50 values for their effect on the larvae of H. armigera.
 The ED50 values and its corresponding fiducial limits along with slope and intercept are given in Table 2.
 However, it was observed that the LD50 values were significantly different at P<0.05, LSD: 6.334.
 Plants produce a wide spectrum of allelochemicals, however, many of such chemicals have not been explored for their physiological significance (Norduland and Sauls, 1981).
 These phytochemicals specifically inhibit growth, morphogenesis, metamorphosis and reproduction (Ahmad, 2007).
 Currently there is resurgence of interest in plant derived compounds for developing them commercially as ecofriendly insecticides.
 Tropical plants are more promising for the development of new insecticides (Jacobson and Crosby, 1971).
 Despite, the fact that hundreds of tropical plants are reported to possess insecticidal property, only few compounds (Azadirachtin) have been commercialized (Chopra et al., 1994).
 For successful exploitation of natural insecticidal compounds, screening for their behavioral and physiological effects in poly-phagous insects with an understanding of structure activity relationship is essential.
 Unfortunately, many do not provided estimates of critical lethal (LD50) or critical effective dose (ED50) which prevents feeding or emergence as adults.
 Nevertheless, such values evaluate the relative efficacy of the extracts and are required for field application.
 In a study, Simmonds et al (1990) reported high antifeedancy (low ED50) for pure compounds isolated from different plants against the larvae of H. armigera.
 Janarthan et al (1999) showed that 0.2 and 0.5 % petroleum ether extracts of Parthenium histerophorus exhibited 100% feeding difference in H. armigera.
 Similarly, aqueous extracts of Calotropis procera and Datura stromonium have been shown to display about 90% feeding protection against H. armigera (Dodia et al., 1998).
 The bioactivity of tested phytochemical extracts varied significantly with solvents used for the extraction and instar stage of the larvae.
 Reviewing the prospects of antifeedant for the management of pests, Jermy (1990) and Ahmad (2007) reported that plant extracts/compounds �with combined behavioral and toxic effect are more likely to have successful practical application than the compounds/extracts, which evoke only behavioral effect of antifeedant.
 Briefly, considering the information available in literature on antifeedancy of plant extracts, the present study has shown that there is a wide scope for application of ethylaceteate fraction of C. roseus as larvicidal/ antifeedant agent in integrated pest management programs.
 Plant-derived extracts or phytochemicals have long been a subject of research in an effort to develop alternatives to conventional insecticides with reduced negative impact on human health and the environment.
 In this study, the chemical constituents of Detarium microcarpum (Guill&Perr) plant was investigated for a comparison of the biological actions of the chemical composition of its leaves, stem and root barks.
 Extracts from the leaves, stem and root barks were analyzed for feeding deterrent and contact toxicity activities.
 All the solvent-based extracts from the various parts of D. microcarpum (Guill&Perr) showed feeding deterrent and contact toxicity effects against Tribolium casteneum, Hbst. a maize weevil.
 Methanol extracts of the root bark of D. microcarpum (Guill&Perr) gave the best antifeedant index and contact toxicity effect on T. casteneum, Hbst with an LC50 value of 47�g/insect.
 IR and GCMS analyses have identified some saturated carboxylic acids and carbonyl compounds.
  The use of plants and plant-derived products to control pests in the developing world is very common.
 Prior to the discovery of synthetic pesticides, plant or plant-based products were the only pest-managing agents available to farmers around the world.
 Plants were first recorded as being used against biting insects by the ancient Greeks and are still used by many people today as biopesticides(Owen, 2004).
 Biopesticides are important group of naturally occurring, often slow-acting protecting agents that are usually safer to humans with minimal residual effects and the environment than conventional pesticides.
 Biopesticides can be biochemical or antimicrobial in their activities.
 Biochemical pesticides include chemicals that can interfere with the growth, feeding, or reproduction of pests or insect pheromones applied for mating disruption, monitoring or attract-and-kill strategies (Copping and Menn, 2000).
 Insect antifeedants are substances which on being tasted by insects, result in temporary or permanent cessation of feeding activity (Kubo and Nakanishi, 1977).
 Antifeedants that reduce consumption by insects act as behaviour modifiers that deter feeding through a direct action on peripheral sensilla (taste organs) of insects (Isman et al.,1996,).
 The protection of agricultural products from pests is essential in many countries suffering food shortages emanating from inadequate storage facilities and/or climatic conditions that favour the deterioration of food commodities.
 Tissues from various botanical species have been used to improve rural storage of grain.
 For example, the dried fruits of Capsicum spp., the powdered roots of Derris elliptica and the leaves and seeds of the neem tree, Azadirachta indica have been variously used in the protection of stored agricultural products.
 In this study, extracts of the plant parts of Detarium microcarpum were screened for chemical constituents and tested for antifeedant effect on a stored product pest- Tribolium casteneum Hbst.
 The plant, Detarium microcarpum.
 Guill and Perr, also known as the Tallow tree amongst other local names, is widely distributed in the semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal to Cameroon, extending eastwards to the Sudan.
 It is found in high rainfall savannah areas, dry forests and fallow land, on sandy or iron rich hard soils.
 It also occurs in open savannah as a more stunted tree with smaller fruits.
 Its hard dark brown wood provides very good quality timber, which is very durable under water, and is used in carpentry Corresponding Author:
 It is also used as good quality fuel-wood and charcoal.
 The leaves, stem and root barks, as well as the fruits have found tremendous usage in treatment of various ailments e.g.
 tuberculosis, meningitis, itching and diarrhoea.
 The fruit is edible and rich in vitamin C and the leaves and seeds are also used in cooking.
 However, the foliage is avoided by most large mammals (Dalziel, 1955; Keay, 1989).
 From the traditional users in the area of this study (where the plant materials were collected), the water extract of the root bark is coated over bags before grains are put in for storage while the dried leaves are placed inside the sacks before grains are introduced to act as insect repellants.
 Insect pest damage to stored grains and by-products from grains cause significant losses to the food industry yearly.
 Chemical control of insects in storage has been used for a long time, but with serious drawbacks.
 The indiscriminate use of chemical pesticides has given rise to many serious problems, including genetic resistance of pest species, toxic residues, increasing costs of application, environmental pollution, hazards from handling etc.
 For these reasons, this paper was designed to develop a potentially biodegradable pesticide with feeding deterrent activity from Detarium microcarpum plant.
  The Antifeedant Bioassay tests were conducted using the Wheat Wafer Disc Bioassay techniques with some modifications (Paruch et al., 2001; Morimoto et al., 2006) The insects used for the tests were reared under laboratory conditions at 27 + 2oC and 75 + 5% Relative humidity on a diet mixture of wheat meal of 190g of whole meal wheat flour and 10g of brewer�s yeas.
 Test organisms used were starved for 36-48hrs before being introduced into the Petri dishes containing the prepared wafer discs.
 Wheat wafer discs, made of finely ground flour and water and baked at 80oC were used as the test food or substrate.
 The discs (2.5 cm diameters within weights of (0.30-0.35gm, which is 30-35mg) were saturated by dipping into the solvents and the test solutions in varying concentrations of 5.0 and 10.0mg/ml.
 The discs, after the treatments were air-dried over night, weighed and presented to the Tribolium beetles.
 Ten (10) of the flour beetles in each Petri dishes were introduced into the treated and weighed wafer discs and monitored over a period of five (5) days.
 Some blank discs (treated with solvents but not offered to the insects were also prepared).
 The wafer discs were weighed before the experiments and 5days after the test insects had been feeding on them.
 The feeding of the insects were recorded under two conditions:
 - on the discs treated with the solvent medium, this comprising of two untreated discs CC [Control]; on discs treated with the various extracts, this comprising of two treated (TT) discs (No-Choice Test).
 Each treatment was replicated five times.
 After the 5-day feeding period, the discs were reweighed.
 It had been observed that despite the drying, the wheat wafer discs still had observable increase in weight as a result of water absorption from the surrounding humid air provided for the normal growth and development of the insect during the bioassay.
 Therefore, a correction procedure was adopted, the disc weight loss, which was the estimate of the amount of food consumed (FC), was calculated using a formula:
 FC = IWS � [(FWS x IWB)/FWB)] Where FC = Calculated Food Consumed IW = Initial weight of the wafer disc (control or treated), FW = Final Weight of the wafer disc (control or treated), IWB = Initial weight of the blank wafer disc (treated with solvent only but not offered to insects) and FWB is the final weight of the blank wafer disc (treated with only solvents but not offered to insects).
 After the feeding deterrency tests have been completed, to measure the activity of the test compounds, the Antifeedant Index AFI is used.
 The AFI is a measure of the percentage of the weight of the treated wafer discs consumed in comparison with the untreated wafer discs.
 That is:
 AFI = %Weight of Treated Disc Consumed x 100 ))))))))))))))))))))))))))) %Weight of Treated Disc Consumed + %Weight of Control Disc Consumed 3239 Aust. J.
  To measure the activity of the test compounds, the Antifeedant Index [AFI] values were converted to the Feeding Inhibition rate [FI] (%).
 A FI value lower than 30% [FI <30], at the 5mg/ml treatment was taken as inactive in this study.
 Tests for contact toxicity by topical application on test insects were conducted according to a standard method (Talukder and Howse, 1995).
 Stock solutions were prepared by dissolving 100mg of the various extracts in 1ml of the appropriate solvent (n-Hexane, Chloroform and Methanol).
 Lower concentrations (60, 40, 20 and 10mg/ml) were obtained by dilution of the stock solution with the appropriate solvents.
 Insects were chilled for a period of 10minutes and then the immobilized insects were picked up individually (using a small suction tube).
 1�l of solution (100, 60, 40, 20 or 10 �g/insect) was applied to the dorsal surface of the thorax of the insect using a capillary tube.
 Fifty insects in the five replicates of 10 insects each were treated at each dose.
 In addition, the same numbers were treated with solvent only as control.
 After treatment, insects were transferred into 9cm diameter Petri dishes (10insects/Petri dish) containing food (mixture of 95% whole meal wheat flour and 5% brewer�s yeast).
 Insect mortalities were recorded at 24, 48 and 72hrs after treatment; the data was analyzed using the STATPLUS 2008 Software.
 Concentration-mortality lines were calculated using probit analysis for the 72hr data with a Log10 transformation of concentrations of the extracts.
 Results were expressed as micrograms per insect.
 Two LD 50 values were considered to be significantly different (P< 0.05) if their 95% fiducial limits did not overlap; slopes were similarly considered to be significantly different if their standard errors did not overlap.
 2.3 Purification of Extracts by Chromatographic Techniques:
 Root bark Analyses:
 Chromatographic analyses of the root bark extract involved extraction using methanol as solvent (after defatting with n-hexane solvent), the concentrated fraction was partitioned in ethyl acetate and then n-butanol.
 From results obtained from the Thin-Layer Chromatography [TLC] plates, the ethyl acetate fraction on concentration was chromatographed in a column using n-hexane:
 ethyl acetate (2:1) and a gradient elution using chloroform:
 ethyl acetate (1:1) was used for further purification and separation.
 Antifeedant Test:
 For the antifeedant tests, the results obtained are tabulated on Table I showing the increased effect of the concentrations on the antifeedant indices with the greatest effect observed on the 10mg/ml treatment of the stem and root bark extracts.
 Tests for contact toxicity by topical application on test insects were conducted according to a standard method9.
 Results obtained are tabulated on Table II and represented on the graphical plot in fig.
 All the solvent based extracts of the leaves, stem and root barks of D.
 microcarpum resulted in appreciable insect mortality ranging between 6.0% and 62.0%.
 Of the five concentrations (10, 20, 40, 60,100�g/insect) used, mortality increased in a dose dependent fashion, with the highest mortality at 100�g/insect for all the extracts.
 The methanol extract consistently gave the lowest LC50 values indicating its superior potency amongst the solvent derived extracts.
 A Graph showing the Result of Increased Concentration-Probit Mortallity of the various parts of the D.
 Four fractions with Rf values 0.26, 0.31, 0.86 and 0.98 were obtained.
 Fractions DMSF (Rf 0.31) was quantitative enough for a preliminary antifeedant test screening and the Antifeedant Index [AFI] values converted to the Feeding Inhibition rate FI (%) had a value of 38.54 for 1.0%w/w concentration.
 [From previous results, an FI value lower than 30% [FI >30], when treated at 5mg/ml was indicated as inactive in this study].
 This was further purified by preparative Thin-Layer Chromatography [TLC] technique and spectroscopic analyses carried out.
  3238-3243, 2010 From the IR spectrum, the band at 1728cm-1 indicates the presence of a carbonyl group [C=O],absorption at 2926cm-1 indicates the presence of hydrogen attached to sp2 carbons belonging to a benzene ring which is highlighted on the spectrum with band at 1458cm-1.
 A broad band observed between 3571 and 3691 indicates a strong O-H (Alcohol) band signal and the signal at 1179cm-1 is the C-O stretch for a carboxylic acid (Bruice, 2007).
 The GC/MS spectrum of DMSF indicated it to be a mixture of two compounds.
 The result of the GC/MS Spectrum is presented in Table III.

 These results indicate that the root bark extract of the D.
 microcarpum plant contained compounds with the carboxylic acid functional group.
 From the previous work done on the phytochemical screening of D.
 microcarpum plant (Hassan et al., 2004) and the antifeedant tests conducted, it has been observed that all parts of the plant have insect deterrent activity in the order root bark>stem bark>leaves.
 The antifeedant effect is more pronounced in the extracts of the root and stem barks compared to the leaf extract.
 The present study has given scientific backing to the traditional application of D.
 microcarpum plant in crop protection practices in grain storage at the village level.
 Given the hindsight of this study, the root bark of the plant will be most active against Tribolium pests.
 Considering the destructive nature of using roots of a plant for pest control and the non sustainability of this option, there is a need to identify the active constituents with the aim of developing a synthetic template for large scale or commercial use.
 With the identification of some carboxylic compounds in the root bark of the methanol extract of this plant which are known to have identified commercial synthetic analogues in the market already, effort at developing potential deterrent formulation might be a possibility.
 In the course of screening for novel naturally occurring insecticides from plants, the activity of the fruit extract of the Argentinian Melia azedarach L.
 (Meliaceae) and its recently described limonoid meliartenin were investigated.
 The antifeedant activity of the fruit extract was tested on a variety of herbivore and granivorous insects through choice tests.
 Sixteen of 17 species belonging to three orders consume significantly less food when treated with the extract.
 The bioactivity of the isolated active compound meliartenin and its interchangeable isomer 12-hydroxiamoorastatin (1) was further studied.
 In choice tests, compound 1 inhibited feeding of Epilachna paenulata Germ.
 (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) larvae, with an ED50 value of 0.80 �g/cm2, comparable to that of azadirachtin (2) and lower than that of toosendanin (3) (0.72 and 3.69 �g/cm2, respectively), both compounds used for comparison purposes.
 In no-choice tests, E. paenulata larvae reared on food treated with 1 or 2 ate less, gained less weight, and suffered greater mortality rates than control larvae.
 The activity of compound 1 was comparable to that of 2, with LD50 values of 0.76 and 1.24 �g/cm2, respectively, at 96 h.
 Shorter LT50 values were recorded for 1 at 4 and 1 �g/cm2 in comparison with 2.
 Thus, M. azedarach fruit extract and its active principle have interesting potential for use in pest control programs.
  To give a brief background, chemical investigations of neem were undertaken by Indian pharmaceutical chemists in 1919, whereby they isolated acidic principle in neem oil, which they named as �margosic acid�.
 However, real chemical research originated in 1942 with isolation of three active constituents, viz, nimbin, nimbidin and nimbinene.
 In 1963 an Indian scientist extensively examined the chemistry of the active principles of neem.
 Following the discovery of neem kernel as a locust feeding deterrent, its chemistry has grown considerably.
 Several compounds have been isolated and characterized.
 The main feature is that most of them are chemically similar and biogenetically derivable from a tetracyclicterpenes.
 These are also called liminoids (azadirachtin, meliantrol, salanin etc.) bitter principles and occur in other botanical species as well (Rutaceae and Simaroubaceae).
 The unraveling of high complex structural features and biogenetic interrelationship represent classic piece of work on natural product chemistry.
 From the practical side these compounds also exhibit a wide variety of biological activity, for example, pesticides, antifeedants, and cytotoxic properties.
 Leaves maily yield quercetin (flavonoid) and nimbosterol (�- sitosterol) as well as number of liminoids (nimbin and its derivatives).
 Quercetin (a polyphenolic flavonoid) is known to have antibacterial and antifungal properties.
 This may perhaps account for the curative properties of leaves for sores and scabies.
 Limonoids like nimocinolide and isonimocinolide affect fecundity in house flies (Musca domestica) at a dose ranging between 100 and 500 ppm.
 They also show mutagenic properties in mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) producing intermediates.
 Fresh matured leaves yield an odorous viscous essential oil, which exhibits antifungal activity against fungi (Trichophyton mentagrophytes) in vitro.
 White crystalline flakes obtained from petroleum ether extract of leaves consisting of a mixture of C 14, C 24, C 31 alkanes were found to exceed or equal the lavicidal activity of pyrethrum extract.
 The principal constituents of neem leaves include protein (7.1%), carbohydrates (22.9%), minerals, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin C, carotene etc.
 But they also contain glutamic acid, tyrosine, aspartic acid, alanine, praline, glutamine and cystine like amino acids, and several fatty acids (dodecanoic, tetradecanoic, elcosanic, etc.).
 Besides, the essential oil consisting of sesquiterpene derivatives, the flowers contain nimbosterol and flavonoids like kaempferol, melicitrin etc.
 Flowers also yield a waxy material consisting of several fatty acids, viz., behenic (0.7%), arachidic (0.7%), stearic (8.2%), palmitic (13.6%), oleic (6.5%) and linoleic (8.0%).
 The pollen of neem contains several amino acids like glumatic acid, tyrosine, arginine, methionion, phenylalanine, histidine, arminocaprylic acid and isoleucine.
 The trunk bark contains nimbn (0.04%), nimbinin (0.001%), nimbidin (0.4%), nimbosterol (0.03%), essential oil (0.02%), tannins (6.0%), a bitter principle margosine and 6-desacetyl nimbinene.
 The stem bark contains tannins (12-16%) and non-tannin (8-11%).
 The bark contains anti-inflammatory polysaccharide consisting of glucose, arabinose and fructose at a molar ratio 1:1:1 with molecular weight of 8,400.
 The bark also yields an antitumor polysaccharide.
 Besides polysaccharides, several diterpenoids, viz., nimbinone, nimbolicin, margocin, nimbidiol, nimbione, etc.
 have been isolated from stem bark and root bark.
 Besides �- sitosterol, 24-methylenelophenol and nimatone, the heartwood contains, calcium, potassium and iron salts.
 The heartwood on destructive distillation gives charcoal (30%) and pyroligeneous acid (38.4%).
 Neem wood contains, cellulose, hemicellulose (14.00%) and lignin (14.63%), while wood oil contains �-sitosterol, cycloeucalenol and 24- methylenecyceloartenol.
 The tree exudes a gum, which on hydrolysis yields, L-arabinose, L-fucose, D-galactose and D-glucoronic acid.
 The older tree exudes a sap containing free sugars (glucose, fructose, mannose and xylose), amino acids (alanine, aminobutyric acid, arginine, asparagines, aspartic acid, glycine, norvaline, praline, etc) and organic acids (citric, malonic, succinic and fumaric).
 The sap is reported to be useful in the treatment of general weakness and skin diseases.
 Seed is very important both because of its high lipid content as well as the occurrence of a large number of bitter principles (azadirachtin, azadiradione, fraxinellone, nimbin, salannin, salannol, vepinin, vilasinin, etc.) in considerable quantities.
 Azadirachtin has proven effectiveness as a pesticide against about 200 insect species and is reported as non-toxic to humans.
 Neem kernel lipids are similar to the normal glycerides from other oilseeds and contains oleic acid (50-60%), palmitic acid (13-15%), stearic acid (14-19%), linoleic acid (8-16%) and arachidic acid (1-3%).
 It is brownish yellow, non-drying oil with an acrid taste and unpleasant odour.
 The quality of the oil differs with the method of processing.
 The composition of neem cake after the extraction of oil varies widely depending on the raw material used for expelling, for example, whole dried fruits, seeds or kernels.
 The range of the proximate composition in percentage are:
 crude protein 13-35, carbohydrates 26-50, crude fibre 8-26, fat 2-13, ash 5-18, acid insoluble ash 1-7.
 The bitter cake has no value as animal or poultry feed.
 Extraction of cake with 70% alcohol followed by hexane yields a meal free from bitterness and odour, which will be satisfactory as feed.
 The neem cake is rich in most of the amino acids.
 It is a potential source of organic manure and contains many plant nutrients, viz., nitrogen 2-3%, phosphorus 1% and potassium 1.4%.
 It also contains 1.0-1.5% tannic acid and has the highest sulphur content of 1.07 � 1.36% among the oil cakes.
 The neem cake contains a large number of triterpenoids, more of which are being discovered.
 A methylene chloride extract of the spice, cinnamon, Cinnamomum aromaticum Nees, was shown to be insecticidal to Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) and Sitophilus zeamais Motsch.
 The contact, fumigant and antifeedant effects of cinnamaldehyde were tested against T.
 castaneum adults and larvae and S. zeamais adults.
 T. castaneum and S. zeamais adults showed similar susceptibility to the contact toxicity of cinnamaldehyde, both having an LC50 of 0.7 mg cm-2 and an LC95 of 0.9 mg cm-2.
 However, cinnamaldehyde had a higher level of fumigant toxicity to T. castaneum than to S. zeamais, with LC50 values of 0.28 and 0.54 mg cm-2, respectively, and LC95 values of 0.32 and 1.78 mg cm-2, respectively.
 T. castaneum adults were more susceptible than larvae to the contact and fumigant actions of cinnamaldehyde.
 The larvae became less susceptible to both contact and fumigant toxicity of cinnamaldehyde with age.
 A flour disk bioassay using no-choice tests was employed to study the antifeedant activity of cinnamaldehyde against the insects and effects on consumption and utilisation of food by the insects.
 Cinnamaldehyde had no significant (P> 0.05) effects on diet consumption and growth of T.
 castaneum adults and had no antifeedant action against them at concentrations of up to 13.6 mg g-1 food.
 However, this compound significantly (P < 0.05) reduced food consumption, growth and dietary utilisation in T.
 castaneum larvae, and had obvious antifeedant action against the larvae at concentrations of 27.2 and 54.4 mg g-1 food.
 For S. zeamais adults, it only significantly (P < 0.05) reduced food consumption at a concentration range of 6.8 to 13.6 mg g-1 food, but had no significant (P> 0.05) effects on the insects' growth and food utilisation.
 Antifeedant action was observed to increase with increasing cinnamaldehyde concentrations.
 The combined contact, fumigant and antifeedant properties of cinnamaldehyde make it a potentially useful grain protectant.

 My research focuses on the structure and functioning of insect chemosensory systems and on chemically mediated behavior, especially the feeding behavior of caterpillars.
 I am seeking to understand the sensory messages that cause a caterpillar to initiate feeding as well as those that prevent feeding, even in the presence of an acceptable host plant.
 The key stimuli that caterpillars detect and respond to during the early phases of induced plant defenses are also being investigated.
 A second area of interest is in the basic sensory transduction machinery that insect chemosensory cells use to operate.
 We are using pharmacological agents, genetic mutants, and combined electrophysiological and ultra-rapid freezing techniques to investigate the mechanisms of transduction in chemosensory cells.
 Details of the operating mechanisms of these cells are being used to understand plant induced defenses, design new antifeedant chemicals, and for the development of new detectors for use in Precision Agriculture.
 Azadirachta indica, the so-called Neem or Nim, is well-known for its biological activities in many countries.
 The present study aimed at investigating the antifeedant properties of the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from the leaves of Neem on Zabrotes fasciatus (Coleoptera:
 Bruchidae), an insect pest that commonly feeds on common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) during seed storage.
 We observed that the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from Neem leaves displayed significant antifeedant activity when it was added to the insect diet via Phaseolus vulgaris seeds.
 Additionally, the inhibitory effects of this extract on Phaseolus vulgaris germination and growth were also evaluated, indicating that both seed germination and radicle growth were affected in a concentration-dependent manner.

 A esp�cie vegetal Azadirachta indica, popularmente chamada de Nim, � conhecida em muitos pa�ses devido a suas in�meras propriedades biol�gicas.
 O presente estudo teve como objetivo investigar a propriedade antialimentar do extrato hidroalco�lico das folhas de Nim sobre Zabrotes fasciatus (Coleoptera:
 Bruchidae), um inseto conhecido como carucho-do-feij�o e que atua como praga durante o processo de estocagem do feij�o comum (Phaseolus vulgaris).
 Este inseto provoca danos tais como perda de peso, redu��o do valor nutritivo e do grau de higiene do feij�o.
 Quando adicionado a sua dieta, usando sementes de Phaseolus vulgaris, o extrato hidroalco�lico das folhas de Nim demonstrou efeito antialimentar, ocasionando assim, uma significativa redu��o nos danos.
 Os efeitos inibit�rios deste extrato sobre a germina��o e o crescimento de Phaseolus vulgaris tamb�m foram avaliados.
 O extrato de Nim afetou a germina��o das sementes e o crescimento das rad�culas de Phaseolus vulgaris de uma maneira dose-dependente.

 In many tropical and subtropical countries there are notable post-harvest losses of common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L.
 (Fabaceae), due to bruchid pests, especially Zabrotes subsfasciatus (Coleoptera, Bruchidae) (Goossens et al., 2000).
 These insects are responsible for considerable weight reduction, decreased nutritional quality, and reduced seed germination power, not to mention the commercial depreciation of the beans because of the presence of adult or immature insects, fragments, or excrements in the seeds (Sari et al., 2003).
 The indiscriminate use of synthetic pesticides for controlling Z.
 subsfasciatus has eventually led to an increase in the level of toxic residues in foodstuffs, as well as considerable environmental contamination.
 Thus, two great areas of interest have emerged, one dealing with bean genotype resistance to this insect (Schroeder et al., 1995; Goossens et al., 2000), and another one emphasizing the use of plant extracts to repel insect attack (Rembold, 1989; Viegas Jr, 2003).
 Allelopatic compounds are chemical agents produced by a certain organism, to affect the health, growth, behavior, or population biology of organisms of other species (Engel; Pawlik, 2000).
 Recent studies have demonstrated that vegetable extracts and their constituents can affect the life cycle of some insects, and these same extracts can also interfere with the seed germination of some mono- and dicotyledoneous (Liu et al., 2002; Tawaha; Turk, 2003; Koul, 2004; Nasir et al., 2005; Dias et al., 2005; Fritz et al., 2007).
 Azadirachta indica is an arboreal species originated from India, where it is known as " Neem" .
 This plant is considered to be the " drugstore of the village" by the Indian population because of the large number of medicinal formulations that can be prepared from its active principles (Isman, 2000; Puri, 1999).
indica seeds were introduced in Brazil in the 1970s, where it has been used as a phytochemical biopesticide (Martinez, 2002).
 Neem extracts and their biologically active constituents have been extensively studied because of their efficacy against a broad spectrum of pests, minimal toxicity, and rapid disappearance from the environment (Isman, 2000).
 In this paper, the antifeedant activity of a hydroalcoholic extract obtained from Neem leaves on Z.
 subsfaciatus was evaluated.
 The effects of this extract on Phaseolus vulgaris seed germination and radicle growth were also investigated.
 indica leaves were obtained from species cultivated under field conditions along three years.
 Seeds were kindly furnished by IAC (Instituto Agron�mico de Campinas-SP, Brazil) and cultivated near Piumhi-MG.
 indica leaves were air-dried at 40 �C and ground.
 The powdered material (1.0 kg) was exhaustively extracted by maceration with ethanol/water 4:1 (v/v) for three weeks, at room temperature.
 Ethanol was removed by distillation under reduced pressure, and the remaining solution was lyophilized and stored under light protection, yielding 120 g of the crude hydroalcoholic lyophilized extract.
 Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) seeds were treated with a 5% (w/v) solution of the lyophilized extract obtained from A.
 indica (Neem) leaves in acetone.
 Twenty P. vulgaris seeds treated with the Neem extract were transferred to a Petri dish, which was then closed with a gauze and cork.
 After being treated with the extract, the seeds were stored in a glove box at room temperature until solvent evaporation.
 A Petri dish containing twenty P. vulgaris seeds treated with acetone only was used as negative control.
 After the evaporation of the solvent, twenty insects (Zabrotes subfasciatus) were added to each dish.
 The number of damaged seeds was counted on day thirty, to obtain the protection level.
 P. vulgaris seeds (n = 20) were placed on filter paper (germitest �) in Petri dishes (85 mm diameter).
 In three replicated experiments, the paper was wetted with either deionized water (negative control) or the extract test solution.
 The treatments were undertaken using increasing extract concentrations (25 mg mL-1, 50 mg mL-1 and 100 mg mL-1), with deionized water as solvent.
 An aqueous solution (4 mg mL-1) of the herbicide glyphosate (Roundup �) was used as positive control.
 The dishes were wrapped in Parafilm foil and incubated at 25 �C, in the dark, for five days.
 Three replications were carried out for each germination assay.
 Control dishes contained the same number of seeds and the same solution volume.
 The number of germinated seeds was determined according to the criteria of 1 mm radicle extrusion.
 Radicle lengths were measured for all the germinated seeds.
 Data were statistically analyzed by variance analysis (ANOVA), with the significance level set at P < 0.05.
 Critical differences between means were evaluated by the Student?s " t" test.
 vulgaris seeds affected by Zabrotes subfasciatus, for both the seeds treated with the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from A.
 indica leaves and those treated with acetone only (negative control).
 The counting was accomplished on day thirty, after Z.
 subfasciatus had completed its life cycle.
 Compared to the negative control, the number of affected seeds was significantly reduced when the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from A.
 indica leaves was incorporated into the medium.
 vulgaris phytogrowth bioassays obtained after seed treatment with the Neem extract, as well as data acquired under negative (water) and positive (Roundup�) conditions are shown in Table 2.
 Compared to the control, treating the seeds with the extract at a concentration of 25 mg mL-1 led to a percentage of seed germination equal to 88.33%, similar to the value obtained under negative control conditions (91.67%).
 However, the mean radicle length was significantly reduced when the extract was incorporated into the growth medium at different concentrations.
 The effects of the Neem extract on both the number of germinated seeds and the mean radicle length increased with increasing extract concentration, in a concentration-dependent manner.
 The results obtained from the antifeedant assays clearly demonstrate that the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from A.
 indica leaves exerts antifeedant effects on Z. subfasciatus.
 The fact that the insect life cycle is not affected suggests that the extract causes an inhibition of the insect?s ingestion ability, probably by making the beans unpalatable to them.
 A similar effect regarding appetite suppression was previously reported for Meliaceae plants (Koul, 2000; El-Aswad et al., 2004).
 The crude hydroalcoholic extract obtained from A.  indica leaves also exhibit inhibitory effects on P. vulgaris seed germination and radicle growth.
 These effects increase with extract concentration (w/v), in a concentration-dependent manner.
 Inhibition of seed germination is similar to that obtained with the negative control (water) when an extract solution at a concentration of 25 mg mL-1 is used.
 However, inhibition of radicle growth at 100 mg mL-1 is similar to that achieved with the positive control (Roundup�).
 These data suggest that the Neem extract not only inhibits seed germination, but it also interferes with post-emergence by influencing plantule growth and reducing radicle length.
 The Neem crude hydroalcoholic extract completely dissolves in acetone (for the antifeedant assays) and water (for the phytogrowth assays), with no precipitated residues.
 This is strong evidence that chemical constituents of this extract are present in all the tested solutions and, therefore, they are the ones responsible for the deterrent effect on Z.
 subfasciatus as well as for the seed germination and radicle growth inhibitory activities on P. vulgaris.
 Limonoids, including azadiractin, have been isolated from different parts of Azadirachta sp (Isman, 2000).
 In fact, the ability of limonoids obtained from Cedrela ciliolata (Meliaceae) to affect the germination and post-emergent growth of mono- and dicotyledoneous has been previously reported (C�spedes et al., 1999).
 Thus, the antifeedant as well as the seeding germination and radicle growth inhibitory activities of the crude hydroalcoholic extract of A.
 indica leaves may be partially attributed to limonoids, but these activities can also be partly due to other compounds present in the leaves, which can be interacting synergistically or additively.
 Thus, our findings suggest that this extract could play a crucial role in protecting P. vulgaris against Z. subsfasciatus and in preventing precocious seed germinaton under storage conditions.
 The Neem extract might not only be used as an alternative for the suppression of Z.
 subsfasciatus populations, but it can also be employed to induce postemergent herbicidal effects, taking advantage of the fact that it displays minimal mammalian toxicity (Isman, 1997).
 The Neem Tree, Azadirachta indica is native of South East Asia and grows in many countries throughout the world.
 All biologically active Neem compounds are derived from one parent compound, the tetracyclic triterpenoid tirucallol.
 All other products formed are considered successive rearrangement and oxidation products of tirucallol.
 It is generally accepted that the tetratriterpiniod compound azadirachtin is responsible for majority of biological effects observed in organisms exposed to neem.
 Neem products can be used as antifeedant, repellent, bio-pesticide and growth disruptor.
 We extract Neem seed kernel using Super Critical Carbondioxide under controlled conditions.
 Tailor made extracts were analyzed by HPLC.
 Extracts were also examined for biological activity-antifeedant activity and growth regulating activity.
 A stabilized composition rich in high antifeedent activity was observed even at 400 times dilution.
 We can supply stabilized compositions of oil as well as neem seed kernel extract for evaluation.
 Test results of Antifeedant activity of Super critical Fractions of Neem Seed Kernels against Spodoptera Iltura Larvae are also available on request.
 Super critical extraction of neem :
 This process utilises carbon dioxide at critical temperatures and pressures to extract the active ingredients of the neem leaf without the usual high temperatures or harmful chemicals.
 This result in a far more concentrated extract, which resembles the herb more closely.
 Our neem products are extracted shortly after harvesting to capture all the healing phytochemicals (the plant's natural ingredients) with superior potency and purity.
 Many conventional extract use heat, alcohol or other chemical solvents such as butylene or propylene glycols, acetone and other petroleum derivatives.
 Super Critical Extracts are superior for many reasons.
 Beneficial phytochemicals are easily damaged by heat and there is a growing desire for alcohol and solvent free natural extracts.
 Additionally, many phytochemicals are not soluble in water and alcohol or oil.
 The supercritical extraction process enables delivery of a broad spectrum of phytochemicals, including both the lipophobic (water soluble) and lipophilic (oil soluble) isolates.
 Conventional water and alcohol extracts contain only the lipophobic components.
 However, it is often the lipophilic components that are the most beneficial.
 The Super Critical Extraction process results in an herbal extract that is very potent (often more than 100 times stronger than conventional extracts), very pure and broad spectrum, closely resembling the herb in its whole form.
 In addition, this extraction process uses only carbon dioxide as a solvent, which once the pressure is let off evaporates completely from the extract - leaving it totally pure and free of any solvent residues.
 The 'Super Critical Point' is the exact temperature and pressure at which a gas becomes a liquid.
 In the case of carbon dioxide, this is a relatively low 31deg. Centigrade.
 Compressed CO2 at this point has the density of a liquid, but the properties of a gas.
 As such this aids in faster diffusion of the phytochemicals (almost twice that of other liquids), whilst the liquid-like state helps in better solubility of the phytochemicals.
 Once the extraction is complete, the pressure is released and the CO2 is harmlessly released.
 In reality, the raw botanical is placed into the extractor vessel.
 Liquid CO2 is heated to its' supercritical state, and pumped into the extractor.
 The SCO2 mixes with the botanical, and carries the desired extract into a separator tank, where pressure and temperature are controlled.
 The extract is precipitated in the separator, and CO2 is recycled into the extractor via a condenser.
 Overview of Neem as an effective botanical insecticide, miticide and fungicide:
 Neem oil is a broad-spectrum botanical insecticide, miticide and fungicide treatment derived from the seeds of the neem tree (Azadirachta indica).
 The neem tree is a botanical relative of mahogany.
 Neem tree products are associated with many agricultural and medicinal uses.
 It is widely relied on for herbal medicine in its native countries and is used in many cosmetic and pharmaceutical products as well as pest control in homes and crops.
 The neem tree produces a compound called azadirachtin, which protects it from damaging insects.
 Azadirachtin is a tetranortriterpenoid compound, which influences the hormonal system, feeding activity, reproduction and flying ability of insects.
 Azadirachtin has low mammalian toxicity; it degrades rapidly in the environment, and has low side effects on non-target species and beneficial insects.
 Seeds of the neem tree contain the highest concentration of azadirachtin.
 Neem seed oil (NSO) is composed of a complex mixture of biologically active compounds.
 When the natural neem oil is removed from the seeds and treated with alcohol, virtually all of the azadirachtin and related substances separate from the oil itself.
 The remaining oil - without the azadirachtin - is called Clarified Hydrophobic Extract of Neem Oil.
 Commercial products containing this extract, do not contain measurable amounts of azadirachtin and contain an emulsifying agent, so are not pure neem oil and may not be suitable for use on certified organic crops.
 Instead, use supercritically extracted, cold pressed or virgin neem oil.
 More than a hundred terpenoid compounds have been identified from different parts of the neem tree.
 Azadirachtin is the most active of these.
 Several different kinds of azadirachtin have been isolated, the most abundant of which is Azadirachtin-A.
 In most traditional preparations of neem as pesticide or medicine, a mixture of neem chemicals are present and provide the active principles.
 Mode of Action:
 Neem has many main modes of action with the primary role of disrupting an insect's metamorphosis.
 The principle active ingredient, azadirachtin, acts as an insect growth regulator (IGR) preventing exoskeleton development and impeding the molting process.
 It is most effective on younger stages of an insect�s development than when they have reached their adult form.
 Best control is achieved when insect populations are light to moderate.
 There are more than 25 other active compounds found in neem, including meliantriol, vepol, and salannin.
 It has garlic like odor, and an extremely bitter taste.
 Its extremely bitter flavor can make many insects stop feeding on the host plant.
 Neem oil can also suffocate mites, whiteflies, aphids and other types of soft-bodied insects on contact.
 These multiple modes of action make it unlikely that insects and plant pathogens can develop resistance to neem compounds.
 Neem has both contact and systemic action in many plants.
 When it is applied to soil as a drench, some plant species absorb it through their roots and will translocate it through the plant tissue.
 As a fungicide neem is mainly used as a preventative and when disease is just starting to show.
 It coats the leaf surface, which in turn prevents the germination of the fungal spores.
 Neem oil and clarified hydrophobic extracts of neem oil is effective against rots, mildews, rusts, scab, leafspot and blights.
 Application and Use:
 Neem is used in both ornamental and food crops.
 Raw neem seed oil (not extracts of neem oil) can be used mixed with water and an emulsifying agent such as pure castille soap.
 One general-purpose application rate is to use neem oil at a 1% ratio to water with an emulsifying agent or non-ionic spray adjuvant.
 Some commercial products containing clarified hydrophobic extract of neem oil contain a surfactant that accomplishes this emulsifying process.
 Use raw neem seed oil at a ratio of 0.5% to 2.0% depending upon the targeted use.
 Apply it as a foliar spray keeping it agitated during application to keep it well mixed.
 It must be used within 8 hours after mixing with water.
 For other commercially prepared products containing neem oil (usually 70% clarified hydrophobic extract of neem) follow the manufacturers label rates and precautions.
 Neem has been used with success world over for aphids, cutworms, fungus gnats, shore flies, leaf miners, thrips, powdery mildew and many others.
 Various products containing neem oil, clarified hydrophobic extract of neem, azidirachtin, and other neem compounds are registered for use in Alaska.
 Pure neem seed oil containing all of the active liminoid compounds is also readily available, however some of these pure neem compounds are not labeled for pesticide use.
 Products containing extracts of neem oil are registered pesticides, tested and approved by the EPA for use as a pesticide.
 The extracts of neem have had the active compounds found in neem oil removed during the refining process, and these products usually contain alcohol or phenol used in the extraction process.
 These extracts of neem have an emulsifier added to help it mix readily with water.
 Pure or "crude" neem seed oil must be mixed with an emulsifying agent to accomplish this.
 Pure castille soap can be used as an emulsifier when using pure neem seed oil.
 Warm water should be used when using crude neem oil since it becomes solid at low temperatures.
 Neem oil has also been used for insects other than those that feed on plants.
 Spiders, cockroaches, grain weevils, and other pests of homes and stored food are repelled, or killed by neem oil compounds.
 Neem has been used for thousands of years to protect grain in native countries.
 It is often formulated into shampoo, creams, lotions, and even toothpaste.
 It is useful as a natural remedy for head lice, scabies, and as a mosquito and biting fly repellent.
 Ecological effects:
 It is non-toxic to humans, birds, earthworms or animals.
 Being oil it can affect some beneficial insects if it is actually sprayed on them so it is recommended to use it prior to releasing beneficials or to conduct a trial to observe its effects on the organism prior to large-scale use.
 Once the spray has dried it will not hurt most beneficial organisms, including lady beetles, lacewings, orius bugs, and predatory mites.

 This pesticide is an effective antifeedant, based on oxalic salts isolated from botanical sources, incorporated in surfactant media.
 There is no toxic ingredient in the formula and as such it is totally safe to human, pets and the environment.
 The formula pungent smell and unpleasant taste which some may find intolerable.
 Specifications Specifications
 The antifeedant produces an unpleasant tang that remains in the sprayed field for some days.
 And therefore the plants become distasteful for the insects to stay on and feed on.
 They would leave the hosts as immediately possible.

 Some researchers claim that upto 70 percent of the effectiveness of pesticide depends upon the effectiveness of the spray application.
 Adjuvants can minimise or eliminate many spray application problems associated with pesticide stability, solubility, incompatibility, suspension, foaming, drift, evaporation, volatisation, degradation, adherance, penetration, surface tension and coverage.
 Adjuvants are generally designed to perform specific functions including wetting, spreading, sticking, reducing evaporation, reducing volatisation, buffering, dispersing, reducing spray drift, and reduce foaming.
 Adjuvants currently marketed in India are formulated to perform a single specific function.
 This makes it tedious for the farmer to mix different adjuvants to get desired results.
 OXYGEN pesticide adjuvant has been formulated to perform almost all the functions which different adjuvants perform individually.
 OXYGEN bio-based ADJUVANT is a anionic surfactant which works best when used with contact pesticide.
 OXYGEN bio-based ADJUVANTS have a molecular configuration that enhances penetration of pesticides into plants.
 This helps in protecting internal parts such as roots from pests.
 A sticker is an adjuvant that increases the adhesion of solid particles to target surfaces.
 These adjuvants can decrease the amount of pesticide that washes off during irrigation or rain.
 Stickers can also reduce evaporation of pesticide..
 OXYGEN bio-based pesticide adjuvant and carrier is a bio-based alternative for toxic chemicals currently used as pesticide adjuvants.
 An adjuvant is a substance other than water which is not itself a pesticide but enhances or is intended to enhance the effectiveness of pesticides with which it is used.
 Adjuvants for use with pesticide have been categorised as extenders, wetting agents, sticking agents & fogging agents etc.
  These chemicals, also known as wetting agents & spreaders, physically alter surface tension of a spray droplet.
 For a pesticide to perform its function properly, spray droplet must be able to wet the foliage and spread evenly over the leaf, These increases the pesticide coverage area.
 OXYGEN bio-based ADJUVANT has adhesive and non-evaporating properties which helps in making it effective as sticker adjuvant.
  Pesticides are commonly combined with liquid fertilisers or other pesticides.
 However, certain combinations can be physically or chemically incompatible, causing clumps and uneven distribution in the tank.
 Occassionally, the incompatible mixture will plug the pump and distribution lines, resulting in expensive cleanup and repairs.
 OXYGEN bio-based ADJUVANTS has a KB solvency value which makes it a good solvent and compatibility agent.
 FEATURES & USES USES
 - Low VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) content ensures workers/users safety.
 - It is bio-degradable so using this doesnot harm the environment.
 Some pesticie formulations will create foam or frothy head in some spray tanks.
 This is manily because of type of surfactant used in formulation and the agitation system of the spray tank.
 Formation of foam would decrease effectivenss of pesticides.
 So, defoamers need to be used to prevent that avoidable foam formation.
 OXYGEN bio-based ADJUVANT helps in preventing foam formation and thereby increasing pesticide effectiveness.
 - It has a very low evaporation rate.
 This means lower application volumes and increases the effectiveness of the product.
 - Regularly used pesticides adjuvants are toxic petroleum based chemicals.
 OXYGEN's Pesticide Adjuvant & Carrier is non-toxic and thus prevents toxic Petroleum based chemicals from entering the food chain,atmosphere & surface water.

 Drift is a function of droplet size.
 Drops with diameters of 100 microns or less tend to drift away from targeted areas.
 Drift retardants or deposition aids improve on target placement of by increasing average droplet size.
 The drift retardant properties help it effectively treat the platations and prevent wash away of pesticides.
 Thickners are used to increase the viscocity of spray mixtures.
 These adjuvants are used to control drift or slow evaporation after spray have been deposited on the target area.
 Slowing evaporation is important when using pesticide because they penetrate plant cuticle only as long as they remain in a solution.
 A pesticide adjuvant would be any substance added with, but separate from the pesticide formulation, which will improve the pesticide�s desired effect.
 The adjuvant can either affect the diluent, the mixture, the pesticide, or the target by its improvements of the pesticide�s performance.
 An adjuvant can be used to adhere the pesticide on the area where the pesticide is functional.
 An adjuvant can change the epidermal layer of the leaf surface permitting pesticide entry.
 An adjuvant can attract the target pest to the pesticide as when used as a food for the pest in baits.
 The pesticide carrier or diluent is not usually considered to be an adjuvant.
 A diluent is used to dilute the pesticide concentration.
 The label usually states the amount of diluent to use.
 Diluents can include water, dry and liquid fertilizer, clay and even recycled paper.
 A diluent is also called the carrier.
 Oil is used as a carrier and enhances the pesticide penetration of the leaf.
 It then becomes a diluent and an adjuvant.
 Some baits use food materials as the diluent and in this case the bait becomes a diluent and an attractant adjuvant.
 Since the very beginning of pesticide use adjuvants can be used by pesticides.
 This made pesticides more effective and reduced the handling problem.
 When pesticides were first used applicators had many problems to deal with.
 Many pesticides wouldn�t disperse well in water.
 They plugged up nozzles, settled to the bottom of the spray tank, and rain washed them off of the target.
 One of the first pesticides, lead arsenate, had animal proteins added with it to improve its spray capabilities.
 Animal bone ingredients were used as sticking agents.
 University researchers during this early period of pesticide usage spent a great deal of their time on adjuvants and formulations of pesticides trying to get the greatest amount of effectiveness out of the few pesticides that were available.
 During the Second World War and right after the war the increase in the number of reliable adjuvants and available pesticide formulations decreased the need for university adjuvant and pesticide formulation research.
 Without these university extension recommendations, the use and types of adjuvants for pesticide applications has become confusing.
 Studying the label of the pesticide requirements for adjuvants is a method of determining what and how to use adjuvants.
 Application is vital to the desired results of pesticides.
 Researchers have claimed that up to 70% of the effect of a pesticide is dependent on its application.
 Even today with the advancement of modern pesticide formulations and application techniques, adjuvants will reduce several of the spray application problems.
 Problems encountered during pesticide application include:
 drift, coverage, adherence, volatilization, penetration, solubility, surface tension, foaming, suspension, evaporation, stability, incompatibility, alkalinity degradation and odor.
 Adjuvants are formulated to reduce these application problems by:
 buffering, sticking, reducing foam, spreading, reducing evaporation, emulsifying, reducing drift, reducing volatilization, reducing odor problems, highlighting where spray has been applied, increasing compatibility, dispersing, and wetting.
 Other adjuvants include those used in vertebrate pest control for taste and stomach adsorption.
 Food and sex attractants are also used in insect control as adjuvants.
 Pesticides like Pursuit?
 specify that an adjuvant should be added.
 There are so many adjutants on the market today that the user has a problem trying to choose the right one for any particular task.
 One publication by George Kapusta of Southern Illinois University contains 411 entries from 37 companies.
 This is a list of categories of some agricultural adjuvants as listed on labels:
  Most of the adjuvants on the market contain surfactants.
 The surfactant is the principal active ingredient of many adjuvants.
 Surfactants can be nonionic, anionic or cationic.
 You will often see a statement on the label of a pesticide to use a non-ionic surfactant.
 Ionic is an adjective meaning containing or involving ions.
 Ions are metal atoms that have either lost or gained one or more electrons.
 The structure of elements is made up of several particles.
 One group of these particles of the atom is called electrons.
 Some of the elements, sodium for example, holds the electron very weakly and can lose the electron to other elements.
 Chlorine is one of the elements that can gain electrons.
 There are elements like calcium that can lose more than one electron and groups of elements, sulfate for example, that can gain more than one electron.
 These elements, sodium and chlorine are ionic.
 They lose or gain ions.
 The atom losing an electron becomes electrically charged with a positive (+) charge.
 The atom that gains an electron becomes electrically charged with a negative (-) charge.
 They become two ions that attract one another.
 They are held together electrostaticly.
 When they are held together in this way they are solids.
 Table salt, sodium chloride, is a solid.
 Another example of this is gypsum or calcium sulfate.
 This electrical bonding or sticking together can be very weak or very strong depending on the elements involved.
 When the solid material is placed in water the electric bonding is broken and the solid dissolves in the water.
 The two charged atoms or groups of charged atoms, one charged as negative and one charged as positive, become free to wander about independently in the solution.
 These are called ions from the Greek word, ion, meaning "to wander".
 In an electrolytic cell or battery with two charged poles called electrodes, the positive charged ions will go to the negative CAthode pole and are called CAtions.
 The negative charged ions will go to the positive ANode pole and are called ANions.
 Sugar is made up of molecules that contain atoms of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
 The carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms unlike the sodium and chloride ions do not separate from one another.
 They stay together as a molecule.
 They do not give an electron to one another and they do not become ions.
 Sugar is non-ionic.
 It is not a salt.
 Dissolved salt and dissolved sugar in water are both clear solutions.
 Sugar is similar to the nonionic surfactants with carbon, hydrogen and oxygen held tightly together as molecules in the solution.
 These nonionic surfactant molecules are free to move about in the solution and aid in the activity of the pesticides.
 Ionic elements in solution with their electric charges can become joined with other charged particles to form solids that can interfere with the activity of the pesticides.
 Most of the surfactants that are formulated with pesticides are nonionic or anionic.
 The exceptions to this are Round Up Up
 USE OF PESTICIDE ADJUVANTS PAGE 3 3
 Ultra???
 which uses a cationic surfactant as its primary surfactant in its formulation.
 Round Up Ultra's??label doesn't state the need for any surfactant.
 The Gromoxone?
 label states the need for a non-ionic surfactant to be added for application with water.
 Pesticides formulated as emulsifiable concentrates, flowables and wettable powders are formulated with 2 to 3 surfactants.
 These are usually both anionic and nonionic.
 The spray droplet must be able to spread out on the leaf surface.
 The more leaf surface the pesticide is able to contact the more effective the pesticide.
 Wetter-spreader surfactants added to the water, reduces the surface tension of the water on the surface of the drop.
 At the same time the surfactant reduces the interfacial tension between the drop of applied spray and the surface of the leaf.
 The surfactants added in the pesticide formulation or concentrate may not be adequate for reducing both the drop and the leaf surface tensions.
 When the spray droplet doesn�t spread out as needed on the leaf surface, other surfactants are added to the spray mix as adjuvants to increase the leaf surface coverage.
 Two segments make up the surfactant.
 One segment is water soluble.
 It is hydrophilic.
 The other segment of the surfactant is oil soluble.
 It is lipophillic.
 The lipophilic segment is made up of a long alkyl chain.
 These two segments together allow the surfactant molecule to mix with liquids that have the two different solubility�s (water and oil}.
 Silicone surfactants have the carbon-based lipophilic chain modified with silicone.
 This changes the characteristics of the surfactant.
 The silicone surfactants greatly reduce the surface tension of water.
 In some cases this increase in spreading is beneficial, but it can be so great that the pesticide runs off the leaf surface reducing the pesticide effect.
 Silicone surfactants can be very effective in entering the leaf by causing flooding into the leaf�s open stomates.
 Leaf stomates are small slits or openings in the epidermis of the leaf through which gases and water pass.
 Most of the stomates are located on the underside of the leaf.
 Surfactants are often measured by the hydrophilic/lipophilic balance.
 This is referred to as the HLB.
 Water-soluble compounds would associate better with high HLB numbered surfactants because they contain more of the water-soluble segment of the surfactant.
 A low HLB surfactant would associate better with oil soluble compounds.
 Oils Oils
 Oils will help some specific pesticides penetrate the waxy coating of the cuticle of the leaf surface.
 Crop Oil Concentrates are materials designed for crop applications.
 These can include petroleum and vegetable oils.
 The petroleum oils used as crop oil concentrates are phytobland.
 This simply means that they are not irritating to plants.
 The vegetable oils include soybean, sunflower, canola and cotton and are not irritating to plants.
 Both vegetable and phytobland petroleum oils are treated with surfactants that emulsify the oils so that they can be used in water diluents or carriers.
 Activator adjuvants are light oils combined with surfactants that emulsify the oil.
 These activators increase pesticide penetrations of specific pesticides on the surface of specific plants.
 These adjuvants are called Plant Penetrants or Translocators.
 With increased penetration the systemic insecticides will give better results.
 This is true for the weed killers that need to penetrate the plant like auxins (2-4 D) and fungicides that require translocation to the inside of the growing plants where the fungi infestation is located.
 Compatibility Agents Agents
Compatibility agents can be added to pesticides to to avoid negative application problems.
 Some pesticide formulations have compatibility problems.
 They break down when added to to
 diluents like liquid fertilizer.
 This can also happen when two incompatible pesticides are added together in a mix.
 The result is a creaming or settling out of the pesticide mix.
 The result can be clogging of the application equipment lines.
 This can cause uneven application and other negative application problems.
 There are compatibility agents that can be added to the mixed solution to prevent these problems.
 The label will usually state that sample amounts should be mixed before making large batches.
 This will give an indication of the amount of compatibility agent needed and whether the compatibility agent will do the job.
 The drift of pesticides to other crops not on the pesticide label is a problem that can be reduced by the use of adjuvants called drift retardants.
 Drift retardants usually increase the droplet size by increasing the tensile strength and viscosity of the water.
 The goal is to limit the amount of very small droplets that are carried by the air to non-target locations.
 In most cases a combination of the use of low drift spray nozzles and avoidance of winds or air inversions that carry the material are combined with the use of drift retardants.
 The need for increased agitation in mixing these drifts retardants with the pesticides requires extra supervision of the people doing the preparation.
 Because drift retardants make the applied material thicker, it becomes difficult to handle.
 Without this extra supervision the drift retardant may never be used because of the added time and effort required when using drift retardants.
 Agitation and the use of surfactants will cause some foam to form, taking up useable space in the spray tank.
 Foam is an emulsion of air in water.
 When the surfactants added to the water increase the tensile strength of the air to water interface, then the foam increases to undesirable levels for application.
 Foam retardants are surfactants that will destabilize the air in water emulsions breaking up the foam.
 There are several surfactants that will break up this foam.
 A silicone/carbon polymer (Dimethylpolysiloxane) is either sold in the wetter spreader formulation of the pesticide or can be added separately.
 It is applied directly to the foam from a container that squirts the material into the foam on the top of the mix in the spray tank.
 Many of the pesticides are susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis degradation.
 When these pesticides are added to the water used as a diluent or carrier and have a high pH, buffers that lower the pH can be added to the mix water to decrease the degradation of the pesticide.
 Phosphoric acid or a salt of phosphoric acid is used as the main ingredient of buffers in pest control.
 Phosphoric acid, a weak acid, acidifies or lowers the pH of the mix water, and keeps it stabilized at the lower level needed to prevent alkaline hydrolysis degradation of the pesticide.
 Strong acids like sulfuric acid will lower the pH of the mix water too rapidly to buffer the solution at the desired pH level for the required activity of the pesticide.
 When the pH is high, the amount of phosphoric acid is increased.
 Some labels have in their directions the amount of phosphoric acid needed to buffer.
 However, many labels do not have this information.
 Testing for pH in the mix water may be required when applying buffers.
  of buffering agents is so inexpensive many applicators add buffers to any water with a pH over 7.5.
 There are buffers on the market that contain enough surfactant to act as a spreader, wetter and buffer.
 Many of the foliar nutrient materials contain phosphoric acid salts that can act as buffers.
 Insecticides like carbamates and some of the organophosphates are susceptible to a high pH in the mix water.
 But, not all pesticides are affected by the pH levels of the mix water.
 Ammonium sulfate, when added to the mix water, reduces the loss of Round Up?
 that crystallizes with magnesium and calcium in hard water.
 Some high pH water or hard water, contain high amounts of ionized calcium and magnesium that will combine with glyphosate or Round Up?
 to form calcium-glyphosate and magnesium-glyphosate crystals.
 This crystallization puts glyphosate out of the weed killing action that is desired by applicators.
 Inverting agents are emulsifiers that are used as adjuvants to invert oil/water emulsions to water/oil emulsions.
 The mix becomes very viscous.
 These inverting agents are primarily used as drift retardants.
 Adjuvants that add color to the mix and are used to indicate to the applicator where the spray material was applied are called stains, markers or dyes.
 Odorizers are materials that add a pleasant odor or reduce the odor of the pesticide.
 These adjuvants when used with pesticides mask or reduce unpleasant odors that can associate with pesticides.
 Pesticides like sulfurs and other solids have a tendency to settle to the bottom of the mix tank.
 When treated with suspending agents the particles of theses pesticides remain suspended in the water.

 Read and follow directions on the manufacturer's label.
 What is Adjuvant?
 An adjuvant is broadly defined as any substance added to the spray tank, (separate from the pesticide formulation) that will improve the performance of the pesticides, herbicides, feeding stimulants etc.
 The water molecule has a high surface tension and this leads to formation of water droplets when sprayed on a waxy surface.
 This results in pesticides not being able to spread evenly, leaving an irregular coverage resulting in higher use of pesticides.
 A spray drop must be able to wet the foliage and spread out or cover an area of the leaf for the pesticide to perform its pest control function.
 In some situations, (very waxy or hairy leaves or insufficient surfactant in the pesticide concentrate formulation), additional adjuvant is needed for good coverage.
 Too much surfactant may permit runoff or loss of deposit rather than increasing coverage.
 The surfactant acts here by reducing the surface tension of the water on the surface of the spray drop and by reducing the interfacial tension between the spray drop and surface of the leaf.
 This requires a surfactant that will preferentially aggregate at these surfaces.
 This may not be done effectively by the surfactants that form and stabilize the oil/water emulsion from the concentrate formulation.
 Why PURE SPRAY TM ?
 PURE SPRAY TM is an adjuvant which increases the performance of pesticides by making water wetter, thus increasing the effectiveness.
 PURE SPRAY TM decreases the surface tension of water resulting in:
 Better and even coverage of Pesticides, Herbicides, Fungicides etc.
 Quicker Soil Penetration.
 Helps keep Pesticides, Herbicides etc in suspension.
 Helps in keeping equipment clean.
 It is non corrosive and biodegradable.
 Specifications Specifications
 (Specifications subject to change.
 Application method and other information are given without obligation.) obligation.)
 Many times pesticides are mixed with other pesticides or fertilizers; this may result in an incompatible mixture causing lumps or uneven distribution.
 A jar test is recommended to determine the compatibility of the mixture.
 Procedure for using PURE SPRAY TM :
 1) For Pesticides (Insecticides or Fungicides) - -
 � Add 5 ml of PURE SPRAY for 15 lit of spray solution and mix thoroughly.
 � Add Pesticide according to the manufacturers' instructions.
 2) For Herbicide - -
 � Add 20 ml of PURE SPRAY for 15 lit of spray solution and mix thoroughly.
 � Add Herbicide according to manufactures' instructions.
 3) For Irrigation - -
 � Take 160 ml of PURE SPRAY in 80 lit of water per acre and then wet the ground with it prior to irrigation.
 � For spray irrigation PURE SPRAY may be injected into the spray equipment.
 PURE SPRAY TM can be used effectively on crops like Rice, Wheat, Corn, Soya beans etc, and on fruits like Grapes, Apples, Pears, Mangoes, Melons, Pineapples, Tomatoes etc.
 In agriculture, an adjuvant is broadly defined as any substance added to the spray tank, (separate from the pesticide formulation) that will improve the performance of the pesticides, herbicides, feeding stimulants etc.
 The water molecule has a high surface tension and this leads to formation of water droplets when sprayed on a waxy surface.
 This results in pesticides not being able to spread evenly, leaving an irregular coverage resulting in higher use of pesticides.
 A spray drop must be able to wet the foliage and spread out or cover an area of the leaf for the pesticide to perform its pest control function.
 The adjuvant acts here by reducing the surface tension of the water on the surface of the spray drop and by reducing the interfacial tension between the spray drop and surface of the leaf.
 This requires an adjuvant that will preferentially aggregate at these surfaces.
 This may not be done effectively by the surfactants that form and stabilize the oil/water emulsion from the concentrate formulation.
 The Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) defines an adjuvant as a substance other than water which is not in itself a pesticide but which enhances or is intended to enhance the effectiveness of the pesticide with which it is used.
 Adjuvants for use with agricultural pesticides have been categorised as extenders, wetting agents, sticking agents and fogging agents.
 The American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) provides definitions for most commonly used agricultural spray adjuvant terms.
 These definitions can be found in their Standard E-1519, and are developed and maintained by ASTM subcommitee E35.
 The Chemical Producers and Distributors Association offers participating companies the ability to self-certify their spray adjuvant products in the USA.

 A pesticide adjuvant is broadly defined as any substance added to the spray tank, separate from the pesticide formulation, that will improve the performance of the pesticide.
 This can include everything from wetter-spreaders to feeding stimulants.
 This is the range of functions covered by regulations in states that require registration of agricultural adjuvants.
 Washington and Idaho do require registration of adjuvants.
 Oregon does not.
 Oregon does require registration of agricultural amendments (sometimes called soil amendments, or substances that modify soil to promote plant growth).
 Sometimes adjuvants are more narrowly defined as a substance added to a pesticide mixture to improve its physical qualities and hence its effectiveness.
 This still includes wetter-spreaders, stickers, penetrants, compatibility agents, and so on.
 Adjuvants have been used as long as pesticides have been used.
 In the early part of this century, animal proteins (calcium caseinate) were used as dispersants for lead arsenate.
 Animal bone glues were used as stickers.
 At that time, the pesticides that were available were not nearly so effective as now, they were difficult to formulate and disperse adequately, and only a few natural colloids and surfactants were available as aids or adjuvants.
 At that time, many of the university scientists in pest control research studied formulation aids as a means of squeezing every bit of effectiveness from the few pesticides available.
 In the 1940's and 1950's, with the production of thousands of surfactants and the discovery of hundreds of pesticides, most of which were oil soluble, it became sufficiently easy to produce a pesticide formulation that was effective (the activity of the pesticide rather than the formulation became the limiting factor in effectivness).
 Consequently, university pest control researchers all but abandoned study of formulation and adjuvants.
 The result is that when you are confronted with a bewildering array of choices for the purchase of an adjuvant and ask which is the best or which shall I buy, we do not have much test data and cannot give a specific answer.
 We can tell you what adjuvants are, how they work, or how to glean as much information as possible from the label, and this may help you to make a choice.
 The adjuvants registered for use in the Pacific Northwest can be categorized according to the principal use on their label:
 To the extent that one of the commonest questions about adjuvants is to simply identify what products are available and which are wetter-spreaders, stickers, and so on, it is possible to tabulate the products on the market according to their principal use.
 There are 155 agricultural spray adjuvants registered in the Pacific Northwest (WA, ID).
 Nearly half of these are either Wetter-Spreaders or Stickers.
 Emulsifiable Oils, Foliar Nutrients, and Compatibility agents account for another third of the registrations.
 Thus, even though there are 17 categories of adjuvants, 80 percent of the array of products available are in only five categories.
 Seven of the categories comprise trivial uses of minor purpose adjuvants.
 Of the major uses, all but foliar Nutrients, Buffers, Drift Retardants, and possibly Oils usually depend on surfactants to perform their major function.
 It is, therefore, of some value to understand the role of the surfactant chemical or principal active ingredients in performing the functions expected of an adjuvant and to be able to read the active ingredient statement on the label when comparing adjuvants and selecting the one right for your situation.
 A surfactant is a "surface active agent" and is the active ingredient in most adjuvants.
 Surfactants are nonionic (do not ionize, but will have a slight electrostatic charge due to the polarity of dissimilar atoms in the molecule), anionic (ionized, have a strong negative charge), or cationic (ionized, have a strong positive charge).
 Pesticide Emulsifiable Concentrates, Wettable Powders, and Flowables will contain 2 or 3 surfactants, usually nonionic and anionic.
 It is rare to encounter cationic surfactants in pesticide formulations.
 Adjuvants will usually contain one or two surfactants, most often nonionics but occasionally including anionics.
 There are sometimes other chemicals included, depending on the purpose.
 In Wetter-Spreaders the most common principal active ingredient is an Alkyl-Aryl-Poly-Oxy-Ethylenate (one-half the products) or an Alcohol-Poly-Oxy-Ethylenate.
 About ten percent of the Wetter-Spreaders contain an anionic surfactant, usually a fatty acid (FA) or a linear alkyl sulfonate (LAS).
 Stickers, or spreader-stickers, also most often contain an AAPOE surfactant as the principal ingredient but also contain fatty acids and LAS surfactants.
 Some stickers contain resin acids, menthene polymers, polyethylene plastic, or latex.
 It is reasonable to assume that products that contain similar surfactants will perform in a similar manner and in proportion to the amount of active ingredient they contain.
 This assumption is held in spite of the fact that the molecular species of a surfactant will not be identical even though they carry the same "type" name.
 Two products may both contain an FA, but one may contain a 12-carbon fatty acid and the other an 18-carbon fatty acid, or an AAPOE may also have different numbers of carbon atoms in the hydrophobic tail and different numbers of ethylene oxide units in the hydrophilic head.
 These differences can affect how the surfactant acts but are not likely to affect efficiency within a "type" of surfactant when used for the same function within an adjuvant category.
 The following brief descriptions of some of the categories of adjuvants may be helpful in clarifying the many functions adjuvants can perform.
 A spray drop must be able to wet the foliage and spread out or cover an area of the leaf for the pesticide to perform its pest control function.
 In some situations, (very waxy or hairy leaves or insufficient surfactant in the pesticide concentrate formulation), additional adjuvant is needed for good coverage.
 Too much surfactant may permit runoff or loss of deposit rather than increasing coverage.
 The surfactant acts here by reducing the surface tension of the water on the surface of the spray drop and by reducing the interfacial tension between the spray drop and surface of the leaf.
 This requires a surfactant that will preferentially aggregate at these surfaces.
 This may not be done effectively by the surfactants that form and stabilize the oil/water emulsion from the concentrate formulation.
  A sticker can perform three types of functions.
 It can increase the adhesion or "stickiness" of solid particles that otherwise might be easily dislodged from a leaf surface, sort of glue them on as it were.
 It can also reduce evaporation of the pesticide.
 If the dried residue from a spray drop consists of one-half pesticide and one-half of some other chemical (on a molar basis), the partial molal vapor pressure of the pesticide will be reduced by one-half and the evaporation rate will be accordingly diminished.
 The third function can be to provide a waterproof coating.
 If a pesticide is fairly water soluble, it may be washed off the leaf during heavy rainfalls that follow deposition.
 If the sticker is not water soluble, it can provide a degree of protection from this form of loss.
 Many of the stickers contain surfactants (AAPOE) as their principal functioning agent and are sold as spreader-stickers, which give both a sticker action and a wetter-spreader action.
 These will perform the first two functions quite well.
some organic pesticides are preventative agents designed to repel certain insects
 But since the surfactants that provide wetter-spreader action must be somewhat water soluble, they may not provide good protection from rain.
 This will be provided by products that contain latex (rubber), polyethylene (plastic), resins (rosin), polymenthenes (rosin-like), or other waterproofing agents.
Petroleum oils will enhance the penetration of some pesticides through the waxy layer of cuticle on a leaf surface and thus increase the rate of penetration.
 This is why brush is sometimes sprayed with a herbicide in diesel oil as a carrier or diluent, instead of water.
 The same effect can be gained in part with the addition of small amounts of a petroleum oil like a summer spray oil.
 Most herbicide activators are emulsifiable light oils containing variable amounts of surfactants to emulsify the oil.
 Surfactants will also enhance penetration of some pesticides into plants, and for this reason one often finds the statement on the label of wetter-spreaders that they will increase plant penetration or activate pesticides and are also sometimes called Plant Penetrants or Translocators.
 This action by a surfactant is not related to its ability to reduce the surface tension of water as is its wetter-spreader action, but is a function of its specific molecular configuration.
 For this reason, a surfactant may increase penetration for a pesticide on one species of plant but not another, or for one pesticide but not another.
 It is best to consider specific data on each surfactant/pesticide/plant combination in drawing conclusions about a product's efficacy as a penetrant.
 Systemic insecticides, auxin herbicides and some other types, and translocatable fungicides can have their activity increased as a result of increased penetration.
 However, too much increase may result in loss of specificity between the weed and the crop from the action of herbicides.
 These products may contain plant nutrients such as N,P,K, minor nutrients such as Sulfur and Zinc, and a variety of trace elements.
 They also contain a relatively small amount of surfactant.
 It is beyond the scope of a handbook on pest control to consider the relative effectiveness of foliar plant nutrients.
 The surfactant concentration is usually near 2%.
 Since this is one-tenth to one forty-fifth of the surfactant concentrations in wetter-spreaders, it is clear that these adjuvants will not be nearly as effective as wetter-spreaders in enhancing coverage by pesticides.
 Pesticides can sometimes be combined with liquid fertilizers for application.
 The advantage is saving a trip through the field.
 The disadvantages are that there may be unequal distribution of the pesticide and that the pesticide formulation may break under the influence of the strong salt solutions in liquid fertilizers.
 There is a special class of emulsifiers known as Compatability Agents or Pesticide-Liquid Fertilizer Emulsification Adjuvants that are designed to prevent formulations from breaking when combined with liquid fertilizers.
 Unless the pesticide concentrate formulation specifically states that it is compatible with liquid fertilizers, it will probably be necessary to add a compatibility agent to ensure that the pesticide will not either cream or sink and thus leave a high treatment rate and a low treatment rate in opposite parts of the run.
 If you have not had prior experience with the mixture of pesticide/liquid fertilizer/compatibility agent in question, smallscale tests should be conducted in quart jars to determine stability prior to mixing in a spray tank .
 Drift is a function of drop size.
 Drops with diameters of 100 microns (0.1 mm) or less contribute the bulk of the drift off site from the treated fields.
 Chemicals that increase the viscosity and the "tensile" strength of water will decrease the proportion of these smaller drops in a spray system.
 They will also increase the average drop size, or Mass Median Diameter.
 This will result in fewer drops per square inch of leaf surface, but it will still be the same rate of deposit of pesticide in pounds per acre.
 This may or may not affect the level of pest control and resulting crop yield.
 The need to reduce drift, particularly near sensitive sites, may very well take precedence over small reductions in efficacy.
 An increase in spray drop mass median diameter does not necessarily mean that the proportion of "fines" or small drops will be reduced with an accompanying reduction in drift, but this is often the case.
 To ascertain performance with regard to drift reduction, data on downwind deposit rather than target crop deposit must be examined.
 Some formulations will create foam or a nice head, in some spray tanks.
 This is usually a result of both the surfactants used in the concentrate formulation and the type of spray tank agitation.
 This foam can be reduced or eliminated by a small amount of foam inhibitor.
 Foam is an emulsion of air in water and forms when the surfactant has a preferential air/water interface and good tensile strength.
 A variety of surfactants will destabilize these air/water emulsions but the most commonly used one is a silicone/carbon polymer known as Dimethylpolysiloxane (Sl).
 This is sometimes included in Wetter-Spreader adjuvant formulations or is available as a separate product which can be squirted directly into the foam on the top of the liquid in the spray tank.
 Some water used for diluting pesticide formulations is alkaline (high pH).
 If the pH is sufficiently high and the pesticide is subject to degradation by alkaline hydrolysis, it may be necessary to lower the pH of the mix water.
 If the pesticide is alkaline labile but poorly water soluble, the formulation colloids will provide some protection from hydrolysis in the spray.
 However, to the extent that hydrolysis occurs from the dried salts in the residues on the leaf, the formulation will not provide protection.
 Buffers contain phosphoric acid or a salt of phosphoric acid, which will lower the pH or acidity of the water and tend to stabilize the pH at an acceptable value.
 The efficacy of any buffer product depends on its concentration of phosphoric acid and the degree of alkalinity or "hardness" of the mixing water that is being neutralized.
 The more alkaline the water, the greater the amount of buffer that will be required.
 Some products give directions indicating the amounts of buffering agent to be used with water of different alkalinity, but not all do.
 Some buffers have sufficient surfactant present to also perform as wetter-spreaders.
 The concentration of surfactant and phosphoric acid are usually lumped together and it is not possible to determine the concentration of either and thus predict their efficacy.
 It appears that for some buffers the surfactant concentration is 50% or more, though some do not contain surfactants, and that the phosphoric acid concentration ranges from about 2 to 10%.
 Some foliar nutrients that contain phosphorous are also labeled as buffers because the phosphorous nutrient is present as phosphoric acid or a salt and thus can also act as a buffering agent.
 Buffers that acidify alkaline spray waters increase the effectiveness of a number of insecticides including Dylox, Phosdrin, Azodrin and Furadan.
 Some specific data from experiments in the Pacific Northwest are available.
 Since many organophosphorus and some carbamate materials are susceptible to breakdown in alkaline water and the cost of acidifying is minimal, many persons simply buffer all sprays with a pH of 7.5 or higher.
 When used at the recommended rate of 1-2 pints per 100 gallons, buffers do not increase the hazard of Dylox to pollinating bees or beneficial predators.
 All acidifiers tested (Sorba-Spray MG, Nutra Wet, Nu-Trex, Leaf Life, Nutra-Aid, WEX and TRI-fol) reduce pH values of about 8 down to 5.5 or 6 when used at 1-2 pints per 100 gallons.
 Buffers increase the residual life of trichlorfon about two-fold and can result in reducing the number of spray applications per season.
 Muriatic acid, Buffer-X or vinegar are not effective for this purpose.
 If a grower chooses to use a Sorba-Spray formulation as an acidifier for Dylox, Sorba-Spray Mg should be used rather than other Sorba-Spray formulations that are incompatible or less effective.
 Do not apply these materials at nutrient-spray strength in mixtures with insecticides on crops pollinated by bees.
 Both the timing and dosage will be wrong and killing of bees may result.
 Reduced effect on lygus bugs may also occur.
 Do not mix nutrient spray powders with Dylox because they may cause a problem with plugging of sprayer equipment.
 Various other spray additives may increase the effectiveness of insecticides, but these have not been tested under Northwest conditions.
 These are special emulsifiers that can invert an oil/water emulsion (the usual type in pesticide formulations) to a water/oil emulsion, or invert emulsion that is very viscous or "mayonnaise-like".
 This requires special application equipment and is effective in reducing drift.
 A number of adjuvants for various special purposes exist for which there are only a few products available in each category.
 For some of these types, there is disagreement among researchers as to their effectiveness, circumstances under which they will be effective, and the concentrations that may be needed to be effective.
 If you have any questions about the uses or effectiveness of minor purpose adjuvants, it would be best to contact the manufcturer and request the data that supports their claims and make your own decision as to which to use.
 A non-ionic spreader sticker, when added to spray solution helps to improve the efficacy of the plant protection product.
 It reduces the surface tension of the spray resulting in improved coverage and also increases the adherence of the plant protection product.
 Classified under Adjuvants/ Colourant Pesticide Adjuvant Adjuvant
 Breakthru belongs to the group of trisiloxane surfactants which are capable of reducing the surface tension of water to about 22 mN/m.
 Such a low surface tension allows the rapid coverage and penetration of cuticular waxes and generates a phenomenon known as stomatal flooding.
 This is the almost immediate entrance of the liquid into the naturally occurring openings in all plant surfaces.
 This rapid penetration translates into rainfastness since delivery of the pesticide into the plant has been insured and a later rainfall cannot dislodge the residue.
 Spray coverage is so enhanced as compared to water alone that spray volumes can actually be reduced by up to 30 %.
 Significant economies can be achieved as less water is required per area thereby either reducing energy cost or extending the area treated by a single spray tank.
 This chapter provides an overview of the federal laws that govern EPA�s oversight of pesticide use in the United States.
 Laws and Regulations Pertaining to Pesticide Registration Registration
 The primary federal law that governs how EPA oversees pesticide use in the United States is the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (PDF), originally enacted in 1947.
 This law has been significantly amended several times, notably in the recent past by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA) and by the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA), which was reauthorized to 2012 by the Pesticide Registration Improvement Renewal Act of 2007.
 FQPA significantly strengthened the safety criteria in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) under which EPA evaluates pesticide uses on food crops.
 PRIA established pesticide registration fees for some registration actions, under which applicants are required to pay a fee and, in exchange, EPA is obligated to perform certain registration functions within defined timeframes.
 EPA also derives its authority to regulate pesticide residues on food items from provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA).
 FIFRA and FFDCA require EPA to carefully evaluate any pesticide intended for use on food or animal feed crops before making a registration decision.
 If EPA determines that use of the product would result in residues of the chemical(s) in or on food/feed items, the Agency may not register the product under FIFRA unless EPA can determine that the residues are "safe" under the FFDCA.
 The FFDCA defines "safe" to mean that there is "a reasonable certainty of no harm" from the exposure to the residue in food and from other non-occupational sources.
 After making a determination as to safety, the Agency may establish a "tolerance," i.e., a maximum permissible pesticide residue on a particular food/feed commodity.
 Alternatively, EPA may establish an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance, which would allow any amount of a pesticide residue to remain in or on food or feed, if EPA determines that granting the exemption would meet the FFDCA safety standard.
 There is a more detailed discussion of the FFDCA requirements and pesticide tolerances later in the "Pesticides Intended for Use on Food or Feed� section of this chapter.
 Further legal and technical authority regarding how EPA regulates pesticides in the United States is found in FIFRA�s implementing regulations at Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR) Parts 150-189.
 These sections of 40 CFR govern the sale, distribution and use of pesticides.
 Persons or companies subject to the law are responsible for understanding and complying with FIFRA, FFDCA, and the relevant sections of 40 CFR.
 Identifying Which Products Require Registration Registration.
 Pesticides are agents to repel certain insects.
 For a company to know if EPA must register its pesticide product(s), it is necessary to know what the law defines as a pesticide.
 Anyone who plans to sell or distribute a product in the United States that is intended to control a pest or regulate plant growth should become familiar with the definition of pesticide in the law and regulations.
 The term pesticide, as defined in FIFRA section 2(u) (PDF) (109 pp, 288k), means:
 any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest; pest;
 any substance or mixture of substances intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant; and and
 any nitrogen stabilizer.
 EPA has listed in 40 CFR 152.6 substances that are excluded from regulation by FIFRA.
 Provided they meet the conditions or criteria specified in 40 CFR 152.6, such substances include liquid chemical sterilants, nitrogen stabilzers, human drugs, animal drugs, animal feeds vitamin hormone products, and products intended to aid the growth of desirable plants.
 Further, EPA has listed, in 40 CFR 152.8, fertilizer products that don�t contain pesticide and products intended to force bees from hives for the collection of honey as products that are not pesticides because they are not for use against pests.
 When other products are not pesticides because they are not intended for a pesticidal purpose is explained in 40 CFR 152.10.
 The use of the terms substance and mixtures of substances in the definition of pesticide provides the key to separating pesticides from devices (discussed below).
 If the product contains a substance that is intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate a pest or constitutes a plant regulator, defoliant, desiccant, or nitrogen stabilizer, then the product is considered to be a pesticide and, in general, will require registration (exceptions to registration also discussed below).
 If the pest is controlled by physical or mechanical action (as opposed to a substance), then the product is considered a device and registration by EPA is not required.
 However, devices are subject to other provisions of the law, which are more thoroughly explained in Chapter 13.
 As set forth at 40 CFR section 152.15, a substance is considered to be intended for a pesticidal purpose, thus requiring EPA registration, if:
 The person who distributes or sells the substance claims, states, or implies (by labeling or otherwise):
 that the substance (either by itself or in combination with any other substance) can or should be used as a pesticide; or or
 that the substance consists of or contains an active ingredient and that it can be used to manufacture a pesticide; or or
 the substance consists of or contains one or more active ingredients and has no significant commercially valuable use as distributed or sold other than (1) use for pesticidal purpose (by itself or in combination with any other substance), (2) use for manufacture of a pesticide; or or
 the person who distributes or sells the substance has actual or constructive knowledge that the substance will be used, or is intended to be used, for pesticidal purpose.
 Toxicity to Humans and Nontarget Organisms Organisms
 Pesticides are substances that prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate a pest.
 A product�s relative toxicity to humans or other nontarget organisms does not make it a pesticide.
 However, the product�s toxicity to humans and other organisms is carefully evaluated during EPA�s registration evaluation process.
 When EPA determines that a pesticide product can be registered for use, the Agency has concluded that the use of the pesticide product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects to humans or the environment when applied according to the label directions and restrictions.
 It is important to become familiar with the other definitions in the law and regulations.
 The definitions for devices, active and inert ingredients, and pests are terms that will be vital for fully understanding the definition of a pesticide.
 Active ingredient (A.I.) � �Any substance (or group of structurally similar substances if specified by the Agency) that will prevent, destroy, repel or mitigate any pest, or that functions as a plant regulator, desiccant, or defoliant within the meaning of FIFRA sec.
 Inert ingredient � �Any substance (or group of structurally similar substances if designated by the Agency), other than an active ingredient, which is intentionally included in a pesticide product, except as provided by [40 CFR ] � 174.3.� 40 CFR 152.3.
 Device � Devices are described in a following section in this chapter, FIFRA section 2(h) (PDF) and in detail in Chapter 13.
 Pests � This term means �(1) any insect, rodent, nematode, fungus, weed, or (2) any other form of terrestrial or aquatic plant or animal life or virus, bacteria, or other micro-organism (except viruses, bacteria, or other micro-organisms on or in living man or other living animals) which the [Agency] declares to be a pest under [FIFRA section 25(c)(1).]� FIFRA 2(t).
 For assistance in determining whether a product is a pesticide or device under FIFRA, you may contact the Registration Division, the Antimicrobials Division, or the Biopesticides and Pollution Prevention Division Ombudsmen in the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP).
 The contact should be made in writing and should include detailed information about the intended uses and composition of the product.
 Submission of a proposed label for the product would also be helpful.
 The addresses and/or FAX numbers for the Regulatory Division Ombudsmen are found in Chapter 21.
 Please do not send any confidential information via FAX or e-mail.
 Products or Substances that Are Regulated but Not Registered as Pesticides Pesticides
 For pesticide regulation, adjuvants are chemicals added to a pesticide by users to improve the pesticide's efficacy.
 Agricultural chemical adjuvants are grouped according to their intended purpose in a tank mix.
  Such agents are often included in pesticide formulations as "other ingredients," in which case the ingredient is reviewed during registration and any necessary tolerances or exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance are established.
  Items that depend more upon the performance of a person than on the performance of the device itself (e.g., flyswatters) are considered devices but are not subject to regulation.
 As already stated, registration is not required for devices although devices are subject to other provisions of the law.
 Please refer to Chapter 13 for further information.
 A nontechnical fact sheet on devices is also available.
 Pesticide Intermediates Intermediates
 Pesticide �intermediates� are substances that may not themselves be pesticides, but are used in the synthesis of the active ingredient or the manufacture of the pesticide product.
 Examples of intermediates are the starting materials used to synthesize by chemical reactions or purify a technical grade of the active ingredient.
 A pesticide intermediate may be produced at the same site as the final pesticide product or obtained from other sources.
 Some pesticide intermediates are also pesticides because they are intended for a pesticidal purpose.
 See 40 CFR section 152.15 for examples of what EPA considers a substance intended for a pesticidal purpose.
 Pesticide intermediates that are not also pesticides are not subject to registration under FIFRA but are subject to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).
 Pesticides and Pest Control Organisms Exempt from Registration Requirements Requirements
 The following pesticides, pest control organisms, and treated articles are exempt from the registration requirements of FIFRA under 40 CFR Part 152, Subpart B:
 Exemptions for pesticides regulated by another Federal Agency (40 CFR 152.20) 152.20)
 Certain biological control agents are exempt (except for eucaryotic microorganisms, including protozoa, algae, and fungi; procaryotic microorganisms, including bacteria; and viruses).
 All living plants intended for use as biological control agents are exempt from the requirements of FIFRA.
 However, plant-incorporated protectants are not exempt pursuant to this section.
 Regulations, including exemptions, for plant-incorporated protectants are addressed in 40 CFR Part 174.
 A nonliquid chemical sterilant, except ethylene oxide, that meets the criteria of 152.6(a)(2) with respect to its claims and 152.6(a)(3) with respect to its use sites is exempted from regulation under FIFRA.
 Exemptions for pesticides of a character not requiring FIFRA regulation (40 CFR 152.25)) 152.25))
 Treated articles or substances that meet the specific criteria of 40 CFR 152.25(a), pheromones and pheromone traps, preservatives for biological specimens, foods, natural cedar, and certain minimum risk pesticides listed in 40 CFR 152.25(f)(1) and on the OPP Pesticide Tolerances Website are exempt.

 Pesticides Intended for Use on Food or Feed Feed
 EPA establishes maximum residue levels (tolerances) for pesticides in food, including animal feed, under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) .
 In the absence of a tolerance covering pesticide residues in a food, that food is considered adulterated and subject to seizure.
 For this reason, EPA regulations require that all needed tolerances be in place before a FIFRA registration will be granted.
  If the appropriate tolerances or exemptions are not in place, the application must be accompanied by a petition for establishment of appropriate tolerances or exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance in accordance with 40 CFR Part 180 (40 CFR 152.50(i)).
 Please refer to Chapter 11 for more detailed information on filing petitions for a tolerance.
 FIFRA section 17 (PDF) (109 pp, 288k) contains import and export requirements for pesticides.
 Except for certain exemptions from the requirements of FIFRA listed under 40 CFR Part 152, Subpart B, FIFRA requires that a registration be obtained from EPA before any person in any state or foreign country can sell or distribute any pesticide in the United States.
 Pesticides produced by foreign manufacturers and imported for sale or distribution in the United States must comply with all requirements applicable to domestic producers.
 This includes registering the pesticide product (follow the guidance in Chapter 2) and obtaining an EPA Pesticide-Producing Establishment number before starting production (follow the guidance in Chapter 14).
 In addition, regulations require an importer to submit to EPA a Notice of Arrival of Pesticides and Devices (EPA Form 3540-1) (2 pp, 83k, Word format) for review and determination as to whether the shipment should be sampled and/or permitted entry into the United States.
 Technical materials may be imported without registration in sufficient quantities to formulate a pesticide for which an Experimental Use Permit has been granted if the EUP application cites the planned import (40 CFR 172.7).
 The unregistered product must be labeled in accordance with 40 CFR Part 156.
  The purchaser must transmit a copy of that statement to an appropriate official of the government of the importing country.
 Refer to 40 CFR Part 168, Subpart D, for more information.

 Types of Pesticide Registration Registration
 Any company wishing to sell its own pesticide product must either:
 obtain a federal registration for its own product; or or
 become a supplemental registrant (often termed a supplemental distributor or sub-registrant) for a product that is already federally registered.
 These types of registrations, together with amendments to a registration, are described in more detail below.
 Before submitting a registration request to EPA, the company must obtain a company number.
 Obtaining a Registration for a Pesticide Product Product
 An applicant who wishes to obtain a registration for its own pesticide product is responsible for submitting or citing all of the information and data that are required to support the registration.
 The information required includes: proposed product labeling, labeling, technical and scientific data that meet the data requirements related to the specific product the applicant intends to produce, and and
 statement of how the applicant will comply with any data compensation requirements.
 Chapter 2 contains detailed instructions on how to submit an application for pesticide registration.
 Obtaining a Supplemental Registration to Distribute a Product Registered by Someone Else Else
 An applicant who does not wish to register and produce its own unique product may become a supplemental registrant for another company that has already registered a product.
 This supplemental registration allows the new registrant to market the product under its own company and brand name.
 To use the supplemental registration process, both parties (the original registrant and the supplemental distributor) must:
 enter into an agreement with one another, another, complete and file a Notice of Supplemental Distribution of a Registered Pesticide Product (EPA Form 8570-5) (PDF)(2 pp, 506k) with EPA, and and
 ensure that the supplemental product bears the identical label language apart from the exceptions listed at 40 CFR 152.132(d).
 Two of the exceptions include the supplemental label utilizing a different product name and the supplemental distributor�s name and address instead of the registrant�s.
 Refer to Chapter 9 for detailed instructions on how to submit an application for supplemental distribution of a pesticide product.
 Amending the Registration of a Product Already Registered with EPA EPA
 If a registrant has a product previously registered with EPA and wishes to make a change to the registration such as change the formulation or labeling text (i.e., add, delete, or change formulation components or label precautionary statements, or add or change uses), it must file an application to amend its registered product.
 Refer to Chapter 6 for detailed instructions on how to submit an application for amended registration of a pesticide product.
 There are certain changes that registrants may make that do not require an amendment application, but simply require that registrants notify the Agency of the change, and other changes that require no notification at all.
 Notifications are discussed in Chapter 7 and in PR Notice 98-10 (PDF) (23 pp, 243k).
 Unconditional/Conditional Registration Registration
 EPA has discretion to make pesticide registration decisions under either the unconditional registration criteria of FIFRA section 3(c)(5) (PDF) (109 pp, 288k) or the conditional registration criteria of FIFRA section 3(c)(7).
 These are described below.
 Unconditional Registration Registration
 An application will be approved under the unconditional registration criteria only if EPA has (as listed in 40 CFR 152.112):
 determined that the application was complete and was accompanied by all materials required by FIFRA, including but not limited to, evidence that the applicant had complied with the data compensation requirements; requirements;
 reviewed all relevant data in its possession; possession;
 determined that no additional data were necessary to make the determinations required under FIFRA section 3(c)(5) with respect to the subject product; product;
 determined that the composition of the product is such as to warrant the proposed efficacy claims for it, if efficacy data were required; required;
 determined that the product will perform its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, and that when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, the product will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; environment;
 determined that the product was not misbranded as defined by FIFRA section 2(q) and 40 CFR Part 156; 156;
  been notified by the FDA that the product complies with any requirements imposed by FDA if the product, in addition to being a pesticide, is a drug within the meaning of FFDCA section 201(q).
 Unconditional registrations can be granted for a variety of applications � such as identical/substantially similar (me-toos) (described below), new uses, or new active ingredients � so long as all criteria above are met.
 Conditional Registration under FIFRA 3(c)(7) 3(c)(7)
 EPA may conditionally approve an application for registration or amended registration of a pesticide product.
 This may occur if EPA determines that, while a registration decision can be made, further data, studies, or action by the registrant are required by EPA.
 This section further details how EPA grants a conditional registration depending on whether it is a new active ingredient, a new use, or an Identical/Substantially Similar (formerly �Me Too�) product.
 Identical/Substantially Similar (Formerly Me-Too) Products:
 EPA may conditionally approve an application for registration or amended registration of a pesticide product under FIFRA section 3(c)(7)(A) if the Agency determines that:
 it possesses all data necessary to make the determinations required by FIFRA section 3(c)(7)(A) with respect to the pesticide product that is the subject of the application (including, at a minimum, data needed to characterize any incremental risk that would result from approval of the application); application);
 the pesticide and proposed uses are identical or substantially similar to any currently registered pesticide and its uses, or differ only in ways that would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on the environment (See 40 CFR 152.113(b)); and and
 approving the registration or amendment in the manner proposed would not significantly increase the risk of any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment (40 CFR 152.113(a)(2)).
 Each registration issued under 3(c)(7)(A) must submit or cite the same data that would be required for unconditional registration of a similar product under FIFRA section 3(c)(5).
 These data must be submitted or cited no later than the time that the data are required to be submitted for similar pesticide product(s) already registered.
 If a notice requiring these data has been issued under FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B) before the application has been approved, the applicant must submit or cite those data at the time specified in the notice.
 EPA may conditionally amend the registration of a pesticide to permit additional uses, even if the data concerning the pesticide may be insufficient to support the unconditional registration, if the Agency determines under FIFRA section 3(c)(7)(B) that:
 the applicant has submitted satisfactory data pertaining to the proposed additional use, amending the registration would not significantly increase the risk of any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, and and
 Each registration issued under 3(c)(7)(B) must submit or cite the same data that would be required for unconditional registration of a similar product under FIFRA section 3(c)(5).
 EPA may conditionally register a pesticide containing an active ingredient not in any currently registered product for a period reasonably sufficient for the generation and submission of data necessary for registration under FIFRA section 3(c)(7)(C)(PDF) (109 pp, 288k), if the Agency determines that:
 insufficient time has elapsed since the imposition of the data requirement for those data to be developed, on the condition that when the Agency receives such data that they do not meet or exceed risk criteria stated in the regulations issued under FIFRA and other conditions issued by the Agency; Agency;
 the use of the pesticide during such period will not cause any unreasonable risk to the environment; and and
 the use of the pesticide is in the public interest.
 Additional requirements for conditional registration of new active ingredients are found in 40 CFR 152.114(b) and (c).
 Pesticides that Do Not Qualify for Conditional Registration:
 EPA will not approve the conditional registration of a pesticide product for a new use if (40 CFR 152.113(c)):
 the pesticide is the subject of a Special Review, based on a use of the product that results in human dietary exposure; and and
 the proposed new use is for a major food or feed crop, or involves use on a minor food or feed crop for which there is an effective alternative registered pesticide that does not meet the risk criteria associated with human dietary exposure.
  Registrants are entirely responsible for their pesticide and pesticide labeling and are required by FIFRA and EPA regulations (40 CFR Part 152 and 169) to:
 ensure that each production facility is registered and has an establishment number (and ensure that any contractor facility they use is registered) (40 CFR 167.20); 167.20);
  notify EPA if the authorized agent changes (40 CFR 152.122(b)); 152.122(b));
 provide information on any adverse effects of a pesticide that have not been previously submitted to the Agency in accordance with FIFRA section 6(a)(2) (40 CFR 152.125); 152.125);
 ensure that their product labeling is in compliance with FIFRA (FIFRA 2(q) and 40 CFR Part 156); 156);
 ensure that supplemental distributor products and their distributor product labeling are in compliance with FIFRA (40 CFR Part 152.132); 152.132);
 obtain permission to transfer registration of a product and/or data to another person (40 CFR 152.135); and and
 pay the annual pesticide registration maintenance fees.
 If a registrant owns the production facility, the registrant must:
 register the establishment number(s) for each production facility (40 CFR 167.20); 167.20);
 maintain product data records (40 CFR 169.2); and and
 report annual production volume (40 CFR 169.2(a)).
 Refer to 40 CFR Part 152, Subpart G, and 40 CFR Part 169.
 The registration and use of pesticides are not only regulated by federal laws, but also by state laws and regulations, which differ from state to state.
 It is advisable to consult with each state and U.S.
 territory for information on their registration requirements.
 The National Pesticide Information Center provides the telephone numbers and addresses for the primary pesticide regulatory agency in each state and U.S. territory.
  EPA's regulatory oversight of pesticides manufactured in, imported to, and/or used in the United States includes not only the science-based review and decision-making process performed by the Agency's Office of Pesticide Programs but also oversight to ensure compliance with federal laws and regulations related to pesticides.
 These efforts are conducted by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA).

 Abstract Abstract
 Previous studies demonstrated that chronic dermal exposure to the pesticide adjuvant (surfactant), Toximul (Tox), has significant detrimental effects on hepatic lipid metabolism.
 This study demonstrated that young mice dermally exposed to Tox for 12 days have significant increases in expression of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (mRNA and protein), bifunctional enzyme (mRNA) and thiolase (mRNA), as well as the P450 oxidizing enzymes Cyp4A10 and Cyp4A14 (mRNA and protein).
 Tox produced a similar pattern of increases in wild type adult female mice but did not induce these responses in PPARalpha-null mice.
 These data support the hypothesis that Tox, a heterogeneous blend of nonionic and anionic surfactants, modulates hepatic metabolism at least in part through activation of PPARalpha.
 Notably, all three groups of Tox-treated mice had increased relative liver weights due to significant accumulation of lipid.
 This could be endogenous in nature and/or a component(s) of Tox or a metabolite thereof.
 The ability of Tox and other hydrocarbon pollutants to induce fatty liver despite being PPARalpha agonists indicates a novel consequence of exposure to this class of chemicals, and may provide a new understanding of fatty liver in populations with industrial exposure.
 Guangzhou China, June 27, 2011 � CCM will release a report China Pesticide Adjuvant Survey this July, indicating that R&D determines the rapid growth of Chinese pesticide adjuvant.
 The report will help decision makers figure out the current status and characteristics of Chinese adjuvant industry, and forecast its development trend on the basic of current status and trends of influencing factors.
 As the second largest pesticide supplier in the world, China demands a considerable quantity of pesticide adjuvant totaling 400,000~500,000 tonnes.
 However, there are many constraints in Chinese adjuvant industry, resulting in few domestic high-performance formulations and rare pesticide brands in overseas markets.
 The reason why the development of Chinese pesticide adjuvant industry lags behind is that local governments and domestic producers pay little attention to basic research of adjuvant and hardly invest in this field, which leads to low R&D level and small output of excellent adjuvant.
 Therefore, the competitiveness of domestic pesticide formulations in global market is rather poor.
 The development of adjuvant R&D is a prerequisite for the rapid growth of Chinese pesticide adjuvant industry, which is to achieve in the coming few years and will greatly impact the global supply structure of ready-to-use pesticides.
 The following highlights will be covered in this report:
 - Key players (producers or research institutes) of pesticide adjuvant in China China
 - R&D of Chinese pesticide adjuvant adjuvant
 - Supply and consumption of main pesticide adjuvant in China China
 - Formula of some key pesticide formulations in China China
 - Influencing factors for pesticide adjuvant development, including factors� current situation and development trend trend
 - Competitive landscape of Chinese and multinational pesticide adjuvant producers producers
 - Role of Chinese pesticide adjuvant industry in the world�s pesticide supply structure structure
 - Cooperation opportunities and market threat to overseas/foreign pesticide adjuvant producer, business opportunities to related industries or companies companies

 Surfactants are frequently added to pesticide and herbicide formulations as adjuvants to improve handling, delivery and effectiveness.
 From a regulatory perspective such additives are generally considered to be inert, and their influence on co-contaminant fate and transport processes has been largely ignored.
 The objective of this chapter is to illustrate the potential effects of representative surfactant adjuvants on the phase distribution and availability of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs), soil water retention and water flow in unsaturated soils.
 Although the addition of surfactants at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is shown to enhance the total aqueous-phase concentration of HOCs, the free (non-micellar) aqueous phase HOC concentration decreases with increasing surfactant concentration.
 Results of pressure-saturation studies and one-dimensional column experiments demonstrate that surfactants can substantially reduce soil water retention and alter unsaturated water flow.
 The purpose of this Regulatory Directive is to inform registrants, other interested parties and agencies about registration requirements for adjuvant products.
 This Regulatory Directive replaces Trade Memorandum T-1-225 dated February 14, 1980.
 Under the authority of Section 2(a) of the Pest Control Products Act, a control product includes "any compound or substance that enhances or modifies or is intended to enhance or modify the physical or chemical characteristics of a control product to which it is added".
 Therefore, non-active ingredients which are (a) components of end-use formulations, or (b) adjuvants which are sold and used separately for in-tank mixing by the end-user, are subject to regulation.
 The former are considered in the evaluation process for registration of the end-use formulation.
 For adjuvants which are sold separately, the requirement for registration will depend on the intended use or label claim.
 Adjuvants of the "activator or spray modifier" type which are intended to directly improve efficacy or to enhance biological performance of the control product by modifying or enhancing physical or chemical characteristics will be subject to registration provisions of the PCP Regulations.
 "Utility modifier" adjuvants which do not directly improve efficacy, but widen the conditions under which a control product is useful or maintain integrity of the spray diluent, will not be subject to registration.
 Examples of utility modifier adjuvants are buffering agents, antifoam agents, and pesticide/liquid fertilizer compatibility agents.
 However, such products with label claims for improved biological performance may require registration.
 In addition to the standard labelling requirements for format, precautionary symbols, etc., as outlined in the guidelines for registration, the label must indicate the following:
 the pesticide product(s)* with which the adjuvant can be mixed; mixed;
 the type of formulation of those products; products;
 the crop, area, or animal on which the pesticide/adjuvant combination is to be applied; and and
 any special equipment requirements or restrictions.
 * Claims for the use of adjuvants with broad categories of pesticides (e.g., fungicides, herbicides) are not acceptable.
 The information requirements listed below should not be considered final.
 If further concerns regarding a product arise, or if the information provided is inadequate for full evaluation, a request may be made to the registrant to provide more information in any of the listed areas.
 For active ingredient(s) of adjuvants not presently found in any registered adjuvant, provide the method of manufacture, composition, specifications and chemical names (see Regulatory Directive Dir93-02).
 If the active is not a single identifiable chemical, give a detailed description of all the components.
 This information should be submitted with the Product Chemistry and also entered on the Product Specification Form.
 For end-use products, provide information as outlined in Regulatory Directive Dir93-04.
 The applicant must provide a complete Control Product Specification Form identifying each component, its supplier and percent by weight in the formulation, specific gravity, etc.
 Formulators and distributors who do not have access to this information may request the basic manufacturers to supply it directly to the Plant Industry Directorate, where it will be regarded as confidential information.
 Unlike the traditional pesticides, the technical active ingredient(s) present in an adjuvant product is (are) not required to be registered.
 The end-use product is registered solely on information available on the product.
 Acute toxicology studies of the end-use formulations should be submitted (refer to Trade Memorandum T-1-245).
 For products with a claim for use on livestock, there may be a requirement for data on safety to the animal.
There is some possibility that the addition of an adjuvant to a pesticide spray mixture could result in greater residues of the pesticide on the crop or animal product than are allowable under the Food and Drugs Act.
 Determination of pesticide residues must be carried out on milk, meat, eggs or other representative tissue of any livestock treated with a pesticide/adjuvant mixture.
 Determination of pesticide residues in representative samples of crops treated with a pesticide/adjuvant mixture must be carried out if an MRL has been established for the pesticide on the crop.
 Studies should compare residues from crop treated with pesticide/adjuvant with residues from crop treated with pesticide alone.
 Studies should be done using maximum rates of both pesticide and adjuvant.
 Pesticide residue determinations may not be necessary if the pesticide is registered for use on a crop on a negligible residue basis.
 Residue data is not required for pesticide/adjuvant mixtures for use in non-crop areas, such as industrial sites, or on ornamentals.
 Information on environmental impact potential may be required under certain conditions of use, e.g., applications in environmentally sensitive areas.
 Efficacy testing should be conducted using the recommended label rate and preferably also a rate that is higher and one that is lower.
 If a range of adjuvant rates is recommended, the maximum and minimum rates should be evaluated.
 Use recommended label rate.
 If a range is given on the label, the low-to-medium rates should be tested.
 Rates approaching the maximum should be used only for the most severe infestations.
 Duration, Location, and Number of Trials Trials
 Herbicides - For a new adjuvant/pesticide combination, a minimum of five sites per year for two years in representative major commercial use areas.
 Fungicides, Insecticides, Acaricides - three to five sites per year for two years in representative geographic locations.
 Trials should compare results from the use of the pesticide plus adjuvant against results from the use of: pesticide alone; alone;
 untreated control or a control with adjuvant alone; and and
 a positive control using the pesticide with a registered adjuvant, if available.
 Follow the instructions on the pesticide label for the timing of application unless the time of application is to be changed with the use of the adjuvant.
 Experimental design should provide sufficient replication of treatment and check plots to provide sound statistical analyses of results.
 Volume of spray carrier and water conditions (e.g., pH, hardness) should be reported.
 A record of weather conditions surrounding all applications should be provided.
 improved efficacy determined by standard methods, e.g., weed counts, weed weights, defined visual rating scale and crop yield; yield;
 increased spectrum of activity; and and better reliability.
 Insecticide/Adjuvant and Acaricide/Adjuvant Acaricide/Adjuvant
 improved efficacy determined by standard methods, e.g., insect counts, percentage of crop damaged, crop yield, decrease in number of required repeat applications; applications;
 increased spectrum of activity; and and better reliability.
 improved efficacy determined by standard methods, e.g., disease ratings, percentage of crop damaged, crop yield, decrease in number of required repeat applications; applications;
 increased spectrum of activity; and and better reliability.
 Observations should be made for crop injury resulting from addition of the adjuvant to the pesticide.
 Data on crop tolerance is more critical when an adjuvant and a graminicide are used on a cereal crop or an adjuvant and broadleaf weed type of herbicide are used on a broadleaf crop.
 For all pesticide/adjuvant combinations, observations should be made on the following:
 foaming: does the adjuvant cause excessive foaming and, if so, can use of label directions control the problem; problem;
 compatibility: does the addition of adjuvant cause sludging, etc.; and and
 mixture stability: when tank mixed in the field, can the mixture be allowed to stand, and are special re-mixing instructions required.
 Please direct any inquiries regarding this Regulatory Directive to The Information Service at 1-800-267- 6315.
 Pesticide Chemistry and Adjuvants Adjuvants
  Droplet size is often considered to be the most important variable in spray application for control of pests, weeds and diseases, and delivery of fertilizers and other agricultural products.
 Extensive research around the world over the last few decades has shown that the main control over droplet size can be achieved through selection of the best nozzle or atomizer, and its setup and use on the sprayer (liquid/air pressure, angle, sprayer speed, etc).
 The tank mix can also have an important effect on droplet size, through determining the liquid physical properties of surface tension, shear and extensional viscosity.
 Some emulsion-based adjuvants can produce narrower droplet size spectra (e.g.
 fewer driftable smaller droplets under some conditions) than solution-based adjuvants of similar surface tension and viscosity characteristics.
 The effective application of pesticides and other chemicals in agriculture, forestry and vector control requires delivery of the tank mix in an appropriate droplet size spectrum for maximizing deposition on the target area and minimizing off-target losses such as runoff and drift.
 Retention of droplets on surfaces is also important to allow exposure of the target to the active ingredient in an effective form for sufficient time for desired levels of control.
 The importance of application conditions in determining droplet size, velocity and transport conditions cannot be understated.
 However, a surprisingly large number of studies and data sets on nozzle and atomizer performance do not sufficiently describe performance for real tank mixes, where water or water with a surfactant may not accurately represent the majority of actual sprays.
 The present paper examines the effects of tank mix physical properties on spray performance, with particular emphasis on the formation, evaporation, transport and deposition of droplets under field conditions.
 Application conditions and tank mix physical properties have the greatest effect on droplet size at the timeframe of atomization through a nozzle, which typically occurs in 5 to 50 milliseconds.
 Meteorological conditions of wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity affect droplet size through affecting evaporation rates while the spray is traveling from the sprayer to its point of deposition.
 Droplet size is also an important variable in this process (Teske et al, 1997).
 Application Conditions Conditions
 In general, sprays become finer with the following application factors:
 � Smaller discharge orifice orifice
 � Wider spray plume angle angle
 � Higher liquid pressure (however, with solid stream and narrow angle/ plume nozzles, lower pressures usually cause finer sprays) sprays)
 � Higher air shear, e.g.
 greater flight speed, greater nozzle angle, or higher fan speed in airblast applications.
 Furthermore, some types of atomizer produce finer sprays than other types, due to the specific mode of atomization and/ or energy input.
 Liquid Physical Properties Properties
 Tank mix liquid physical properties have an important effect on the formation, and therefore droplet size, of sprays.
 This has been confirmed in studies such as those of the Spray Drift Task Force where atomization of liquids with a near-maximum range of values from tank mix types was tested through a wide range of nozzle types (Hewitt et al, 1997), and in studies involving adjuvants (e.g.
 Although the effects of tank mix are usually lower than those of application conditions, tank mix physical properties can nonetheless change the droplet size spectrum sufficiently to move a spray one or two ASAE (1999) droplet size classification categories.
 Forces from surface tension and viscosity tend to resist the breakup of liquid sheets and ligaments into droplets, thereby increasing the average droplet size (Hewitt and Hermansky, 1997).
 Conversely, if surface tension or viscosity are reduced, the liquid sheet can more easily expand and initiate the development of wavy perforations leading to breakup with smaller droplets.
 Breakup length from sheets and ligaments can be reduced by adding materials such as non-ionic surfactants that lower the surface tension.
  Therefore, many surface acting agents (or surfactants) are added to tank mixes for their spreading, wetting and sticking characteristics.
 However, as explained above, there is often a less desirable effect from the production of smaller droplets at atomization, which may increase the drift potential of the spray under unfavorable conditions.
 Recent research has shown that solution adjuvants such as non-ionic surfactants, tend to cause the production of greater proportions of small droplets per average droplet size for a given dynamic surface tension than do many emulsion adjvants.
 Figure 1 shows an example of this trend for a wind tunnel atomization study with the application of herbicides as extremely coarse sprays through narrow plume nozzles under helicopter application conditions.
 When emulsion adjuvants (e.g. modified seed oils) were used to obtain specific dynamic surface tension values, there were fewer very small droplets per volume median diameter value than when solution adjuvants (e.g.
 non-ionic surfactants) were used (Figure 1, and Hewitt, 2003).
 Similar reductions in the proportion of small droplets have also been observed for some invert emulsion/ suspension and lecithin-based adjuvants (Hewitt et al, 2001).
 Viscosity affects droplet formation through resistance to flow, which can include elongational flow if a polymer or other extensional viscosity modifying adjuvant is present in the tank mix.
 An increase in shear viscosity tends to cause an increase in droplet size.
 On the other hand, an increase in extensional viscosity can cause an increase in the average droplet size (e.g.
 volume median diameter or Dv0.5) as well as in some cases an increase in the proportion of smaller droplets with diameter below ~200�m.
 Such an increase in the range of droplet sizes within a spray (relative span, or Dv0.9-Dv0.1/Dv0.5) is usually not desirable, so it is important to determine the effect of a particular adjuvant on the entire droplet size spectrum, not just the Dv0.5, when selecting it for a specific effect such as drift management.
 Also, some adjuvants cause a change in one pattern with one nozzle type, but a completely different trend with a different nozzle type (Figures 2 and 3 for addition of a polymer to tank mix applied through flat fan and disc-core nozzles).
 The same can apply to tank mix partners, with some organic solvents possibly affecting some adjuvants differently than others.
 Some polymers Invited Presentation Articles 134 Figure 1.

 (especially some polyacrylamides) break down when pumped through typical agricultural spraying equipment.
 In view of these complex trends, actual testing of adjuvants with real active ingredient pesticides (or at least blanks representing the composition of such pesticides without the active ingredient components) through several different types of nozzle and pumping regimes is important in assessing behavior under real-world conditions.
 The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) is finalizing standards for such testing.
 Factors Affecting Droplet Transport and Deposition Deposition
 Following release though a nozzle or atomizer, droplets will tend to be carried in the air until collecting on surfaces by impaction (onto vertical and horizontal surfaces) and sedimentation deposition (onto horizontal surfaces).
 The size of the droplets, as well as the release height and meteorological conditions affect such transport and deposition patterns.
 These phenomena are well understood through equations of motion and particle transport and diffusion, and can be studied with models such as AGDISP and AgDRIFT (Teske et al, 2002).
 The physical properties of the tank mix affect this process through influence on the emission droplet size spectra, as well as evaporation rates and density which can affect fall rates.
 Again, once the relevant physical properties are known, such movements and deposition can be studied using appropriate models such as AGDISP.
 Factors Affecting Droplet Retention Retention
 Many adjuvants have value in improving the retention of droplets on leaves and target surfaces, through sticking and rainfastness, as well as assistance in penetration and uptake, which reduces the time available for the active ingredient to be lost through a rain event, or by lift-off in evaporation.
 Some researchers have proposed theories of co-distillation of active ingredient with water lost from leaves, which has been theorized as a possible factor contributing to secondary movements of pesticide hours or even days after application.
 However, such losses have not been definitively proven or measured, and in any case would only apply to relatively volatile products that are not incorporated or uptaken into the soil or plant.
 It is possible that some adjuvants, such as polymers may reduce the possibility of such secondary movements of pesticide; however, significant research has not yet been conducted in this area.
 Although it is well known that judicious use of adjuvants can increase the performance of foliage-applied sprays of many agrochemicals, little information is available in the public domain about their ultimate effects on pesticide residues in treated crops.
 In the present work, the influence of Agral (polyoxyethylene nonylphenols), Toil (methyl esters of rapeseed fatty acids) and Bond (styrene-butadiene copolymers) on surface and crop residues of diclofop-methyl/diclofop and propiconazole in wheat and field beans was investigated using a model system simulating field practice.
 Pesticides were applied as commercial formulations, diclofop-methyl 378 g litre(-1) EC (Hoegrass) and propiconazole 250 g litre(-1) EC (Tilt), at their maximum approved rates, 1135 g AI ha(-1) and 125 g AI ha(-1), respectively, both in the presence or absence of the maximum rate recommended for each candidate adjuvant.
 No detectable residues of diclofop-methyl or propiconazole were found in wheat 35 days after any of the four applications.
 However, residues of diclofop were present in this crop, and those from applications containing Agral (0.07 mg kg(-1) fresh weight (FW)) or Bond (0.08 mg kg(-1) FW) were significantly lower than those with no adjuvant (0.14 mg kg(-1) FW) or Toil (0.16 mg kg(-1) FW).
 Unlike wheat, residues of both diclofop and propiconazole were detected in field beans after harvest.
 Significantly higher residues of the former were recorded from the applications with Agral or Bond (ca 0.32 mg kg(-1) FW) than with those with no adjuvant or Toil (ca 0.15mg kg(-1) FW).
 All the propiconazole applications containing adjuvants showed a similar significant increase in residues (0.10-0.16 mg AI kg(-1) FW) over the no-adjuvant treatment (0.05 mg kg(-1) FW) in this crop.
 There appeared to be little agreement between the apparent amounts of uptake, as indicated by the rates of decline of surface residues up to 5 days after application, and final residues in either target species.
 On wheat, surface residues of diclofop-methyl decreased from initially ca 20 to as little as 0.02 mg kg(-1) FW using adjuvants; the corresponding values for propiconazole were ca 2 to ca 0.03 mg kg(-1) FW.
 Recoveries of diclofop-methyl from the surfaces of field beans were much higher than those from wheat, declining from ca 30 to only ca 6 mg kg(-1) FW during the course of 5 days; the corresponding residues for propiconazole were ca 2 mg to 0.15 mg kg(-1) FW.
 These findings are discussed in relation to uptake results obtained with radiolabelled pesticides and adjuvants in the laboratory, and to the mandatory requirements for pesticide residue data for the authorised use of adjuvants in the UK.
 In our modern agricultural industry pesticides prevent weeds, harmful insects and plant diseases from damaging or destroying profitable crops.
 However, even the best pesticide is not effective in prevention if it is not mixed and applied correctly.
 Spray Adjuvants help protect the dollars spent on pesticides.
 Spray adjuvants can be used by pesticides to enhance their performance and to correct mixing and application problems before they occur.
 Willowood USA recognizes the important role that spray adjuvants play in today�s agricultural practices.
 Through extensive research and testing, Willowood USA has developed a broad line of spray adjuvants formulated to prevent specific application problems and improve the effectiveness of most pesticides.
 This brochure is designed to provide a simple straightforward explanation of whatspray adjuvants are and how they work as cost saving materials in crop production.
 Spray adjuvants are a small investment that can be a highly effective means of protecting the performance of pesticides.
 An Ounce of Prevention...
 Simply Stated:
 A Spray Adjuvant is either...
 #1 - An Additive that Corrects Mixing or Application Problems.
 These spray adjuvants are designed to prevent and control very specific problems that may occur by combing and applying pesticides and fertilizers.
 Some of these spray adjuvants prevent foam, reduce drift, correct pH levels and/or prevent solutions from separating when mixed.
 #2 - An Additive that Improves the Performance of a Pesticide.
 Spray adjuvants that work to improve the performance of pesticides do so by enhancing the reaction of the pesticide solution when it comes into contact with the leaf surface.
 Spray adjuvants, sometimes call surfactants (surf-surface, act-active, ants-agents) help reduce surface tension to allow a pesticide to cover, penetrate and/or adhere to the leaf�s surface depending on whether they have an anionic, nonionic or cationic charge.
 Anionic, Nonionic and Cationic Charges are Chemical Bonds, which affect the Relationship between Spray Spray
 Solutions and Leaf Surfaces.
 Like-poles of magnets will repel each other and unlike-poles attract.
 Spray adjuvants have properties similar to magnets.
 Most leaf surfaces are negatively charged and spray adjuvants may be negatively, neutrally or positively charged.
 When a negatively charged solution comes in contact with a negatively charged leaf surface the solution will be repelled or caused to spread over the leaf.
 When a neutrally charged solution comes in contact with a negatively charged leaf surface the solution will penetrate and spreadon the leaf.
 When a positively charged solution comes in contact with a negatively charged leaf surface the solution will be attracted or caused to stick on the leaf.
 Many spray adjuvants are formulated to perform more than one of these functions.
 *Amphoterics are naturally occurring substances that exhibit the combined properties of anionic, nonionic and cationic.
 Most EPA pesticide labels will make specific recommendations to use a spray adjuvant that contains either an anionic, nonionic or cationic surfactant.
 It is important to remember that the total percent of �active ingredient� in a spray adjuvant is a combination of more that one ingredient, including but not exclusively surfactant.
 The Fundamentals Fundamentals
 With over 500 pesticides currently on the market, the use of spray adjuvants is continually increasing.
 Most EPA registered pesticides have very specific recommendations for use of one or more spray adjuvants.
 Each spray adjuvant manufactured is designed to perform a very specific function under unique circumstances.
 Spray adjuvants may perform and of the following functions:
 � Spreading � Sticking � Penetrating Penetrating
 � Preventing Foam � Buffering � Wetting Wetting
 � Dispersing � Controlling Drift � Marking Marking
 � Preventing UV Breakdown � Emulsifying � Attracting Attracting
 � Enhancing Biological Activity � Mixing � Extending Extending
 Willowood USA spray adjuvants are divided into seven different categories.
 Within each category, several different spray adjuvants exist.
 The differences between certain spray adjuvants may seem subtle on the label, but may have dramatic effects on the spray mix.
 For this reason it is important to always read the pesticide label and spray adjuvant label carefully before mixing or applying any solution.

 The Functions Functions
 Most pesticides are designed to be applied using water as the carrier.
 Unfortunately some water sources have very high pH.
 Many pesticides work most effectively on the slightly acidic side, somewhere in the pH 4.5 to 6 range.
 Many water sources test pH 7.5 and higher � far over on the alkaline side of the scale.
 High pH (alkaline) water can and does cause come pesticide material to undergo a chemical breakdown or degradation call �alkaline hydrolysis.� Alkaline water increases the decomposition rate of many pesticides, often resulting in a much poorer pesticide performance than expected.
 The pesticide losses due to alkaline hydrolysis are permanent, irreversible and costly.
 Buffers are spray adjuvants that lower the pH of water and hold it at the lower pH as pesticides and nutrients are added.
 Mixing an herbicide, an insecticide, a fungicide and a nutrient together in one tank is an accepted spraying method.
 The combination of products saves time.
 One application across the field can increase the number of pests controlled.
 However, these products are not necessarily compatible and may not mix uniformly.
 So, the time-saving method could become a costly waste of several products that are unable to perform because they are incompatible with each other.
 Compatibility agents are spray adjuvants that correct mixing problems.
 Certain compatibility agents allow pesticides to mix with water and others allow pesticides to mix with fertilizers.
 Willowood USA always recommends that a simple jar test for compatibility be conducted before actually mixing an entire spray tank.
 Avoid pesticide breakdown by buffering spray water before mixing.
 Buffers adjust alkaline waters to a pH that is slightly acidic, which is ideal for many pesticides.
 A compatibility agent allows solutions to mix uniformly, which assures even field applications.
 Compatibility Agents Agents
 Buffers Buffers
 Most pesticides are applied to crops by means of some type of spray rig or aircraft.
 The nozzle size, angle and pressure with which the pesticides are applied can be controlled.
 However, many of the pesticides spray droplets may not reach their intended target.
 In fact, most small droplets drift away from the target, especially in windy conditions.
 This can be a very costly pesticide application problem, because droplets that are not on the intended target are either on a neighbor�s crop or are wasted in the air.
 Drift control agents are spray adjuvants that reduce spray mist by increasing the size of the droplets.
 Drift control agents unite tiny particles that make up the spray pattern.
 Drift Control Agents The addition of a drift control agent enlarges water droplets (above), reducing the fine mist (right).
 Anti-Foam agents are added to a tank before other solutions to prevent the formation of foam.
 Many pesticides and spray adjuvants can produce large amounts of foam in tank mixes.
 Foam can cause the tank mix to overflow, causing possible contamination of soil and human exposure.
 Although foam is something that can be reduced it should be prevented.
 Anti-Foaming agents are spray adjuvants that prevent foaming in emulsions, wettable powders and water based systems.
 Anti-Foaming agents help minimize entrapped air caused by mechanical agitation in spray tanks.
 Anti-Foam Agents Agents
 Many pesticides must be able to penetrate into a plant�s cuticle in order to perform effectively.
 This is not easy for pesticides to do because most leaves have a hairy, waxy surface that acts as a barrier to the cuticle.
 Penetrants are spray adjuvants that cause the wax particles on a leaf�s surface to stand upright, which opens up passage to the leaf�s cuticle.
 This encourages rapid penetration of the pesticide which allows it to act quicker.
 Penetrants, because they allow rapid penetration, also make pesticides less vulnerable to breakdown by ultraviolet light.
 In order for many pesticides to perform to their full capacity, they must thoroughly coat all parts of the target plants.
 An even coating is extremely important for contact pesticides.
 However, because most pesticides are applied using water as the carrier, surface tension causes spray solution droplets to slide off of plant surfaces, leaving areas uncovered.
 Spreaders are spray adjuvants that reduce the surface tension of spray solution droplets to the point that they can spread and blend together to uniformly coat plant surfaces, avoiding costly runoff of spray material.
 Once a pesticide has been applied to a plant�s surface, it must stay there long enough to perform its function.
 Rainstorms, fog, irrigation water and other environmental circumstances can cause pesticides to wash off before they have had a chance to work to their full potential.
 Stickers are spray adjuvants that help pesticide spray solution droplets cover and adhere firmly to plant surfaces and resist being washed off.
 Stickers are designed to keep the pesticides in place during their intended use period.
  Wine grape growing is under increasing pressure to reduce pesticide use.
 A project was undertaken to develop new adjuvant prescriptions to reduce spray volumes required throughout full-season pesticide programmes in vineyards and to improve spray coverage and retention on foliage and grape bunches.
 A pre-harvest field trial confirmed improved targeting of Chardonnay foliage and bunches with markedly lowered spray application volumes when a novel organosilicone adjuvant, Du-Wett, was included in the spray mix.
 Application volumes of �200 litres/ha maximised retention and distribution of pesticide sprays containing the organosilicone.
 The optimal Du-Wett rate required in sprays targeting foliage was lower (0.2-0.4 litres/ha) than that in sprays directed at grape bunches (0.2-0.8 litres/ha).
 The results suggest spray application volumes on grapes could be greatly reduced with use of appropriate adjuvants, without compromising pesticide efficacy.
  Wine grape growing is pesticide intensive and, like other horticultural operations, is coming under increasing pressure to reduce pesticide use, avoid spray drift and minimise soil and water contamination.
 Traditional spray programmes in New Zealand vineyards involve high volume application of agrochemicals to wet canopies to the point of run-off.
 Such high volumes are inefficient in terms of spray losses through drift and runoff, droplet sizes that limit canopy penetration and coverage, low work rates and high use of water resources.
 The products available to grape growers to control pests and diseases are limited and the industry represents too small a market to warrant the development of major agrochemical products specifically for its use.
 Thus, growers increasingly need to modify formulations and application systems to improve the efficacy of their spray programmes.
 Spray adjuvants are at the forefront of a global trend to customise pesticides for specific applications and to reduce environmental contamination by maximising pesticide efficacy (Underwood et al.
 In New Zealand, recent studies with organosilicone adjuvants have demonstrated their ability to improve the effectiveness of growers� spray programmes in kiwifruit (Gaskin et al.
  The objective of this study was to determine the potential of novel organosilicone adjuvant blends to reduce agrochemical spray volumes while maintaining, or improving, retention and coverage of sprays on grape bunches and foliage.
 The two organosilicone adjuvant blends investigated in this study were Du-Wett (Elliott Chemicals Ltd) and Bond Xtra (Loveland Industries, USA), a superspreader and stickerspreader, respectively.
 These adjuvants, and their properties, have been described previously (Gaskin et al.
 Citowett (alkylaryl polyglycol ether; BASF), a commonly-used horticultural adjuvant, was included for comparison at the rate recommended on the label 2002 New Zealand Plant Protection Society (Inc.) www.nzpps.org Refer to http://www.nzpps.org/terms_of_use.html Application Technology 155 (25 ml/100 litres).
 Spreading measurements, as described by Gaskin et al. (2000b), were made in the laboratory on freshly detached leaves from outdoor-reared grape plants (cv. Chardonnay) and on red table grapes (ex-USA) sourced from a local supermarket.
 Spreading of more than 30 combinations of active ingredients regularly applied as mixtures in vineyard spray programmes (S. Bradley, Delegats, pers. comm.), was determined with the addition of up to seven adjuvant rates, on both leaves and berries.
 Retention studies were conducted in the field on a mature, well leaf-plucked VSP Chardonnay canopy, located in the HortResearch vineyard in Hawke�s Bay, immediately prior to harvest (April).
 Treatments were applied with a Cropliner 820 mm diameter axial fan airblast sprayer under warm, still conditions using the low fan speed (ca 30,000 m3/h air output).
 Applications were made at 5.4 km/h, with different combinations of Spraying Systems hollow cone TX nozzles and operating pressures used to deliver the different application volumes required.
 Four nozzles were used to target the canopy in each case, with outputs divided so that the lower two nozzles delivered 55-60% of the spray plume into the bunch zone (a ca 400 mm vertical swath), with the output from the upper two nozzles directed to the remainder of the canopy (a ca 900 mm vertical swath).
 All treatments contained pyrimethanil (800 g ai/ha; Scala, BASF) and tartrazine dye (10 g/litre).
 Bunches (5 bunches/replicate; 5 replicates/treatment) and foliage (6 leaves/replicate; 5 replicates/ treatment) were collected immediately after spraying and stored in sealed plastic bags in the dark in a cool store prior to analysis.
 Leaves were sampled from outer and inner positions at three canopy heights:
 bunch line, mid-canopy and upper-canopy positions.
 Samples were washed in known aliquots of distilled water and dye absorbance determined as described previously (Murray et al. 1998).
 Leaf areas were determined with a Licor LI- 3100 Leaf Area Meter and bunches were weighed fresh.
 Retention results were normalised at 1 kg/ha dye application to enable comparison of treatments.
 Analysis of variance and least significant difference (LSD) tests at P<0.05 were used to compare treatment means.
  A selection of spreading results are presented in Table 1 to illustrate the main effects of the adjuvants and their interactions with formulations and plant surfaces.
 As expected of a superwetter, Du-Wett enhanced spreading of all formulations; coverage increased with increasing concentration and often the response was linear.
 Bond Xtra spray solutions overall spread much less than Du-Wett, but when used at high rates, Bond Xtra also exhibited superspreading activity due to its organosilicone component.
 Waxy grapes were more difficult to wet than foliage and formulations required higher adjuvant rates to achieve good spreading on fruit.
 � 2002 New Zealand Plant Protection Society (Inc.) www.nzpps.org Refer to http://www.nzpps.org/terms_of_use.html http://www.nzpps.org/terms_of_use.html
 Agrochemical formulations can have varying and often unpredictable effects on the spreading properties of organosilicone adjuvants (Gaskin et al. 2000b) and this was ighlighted in this study.
 Conventional adjuvants such as Citowett are affected little by �in-can� formulants of active ingredients because these adjuvants promote comparatively little droplet spread.
 In contrast, the superspreading of organosilicones may be reduced or enhanced by different formulations (Table 1).
 If organosilicone use is to be optimised this must be taken into account when prescribing treatments.
 For example, Du-Wett addition to mancozeb+sulphur provided excellent foliage coverage at 0.2%.
 When captan was combined with sulphur, spreading of the spray solution was effectively doubled, increasing the likelihood of run-off and hence, reduced efficacy.
 In contrast, when chlorpyrifos was included in tank mix with captan, some antagonism of organosilicone spreading properties may have resulted in less than expected spray coverage of foliage, compared to captan+sulphur.
 A similar pattern is seen with Bond Xtra at 0.4%, the highest rate.
 When the spray target was fruit, which is more difficult to wet, such differences were not so apparent and the relativity between treatments was changed completely.
 Our results confirm that interactions between adjuvant formulations and plant surfaces are not always easy to predict.
 Spray retention and distribution on field vines The systematic retention study confirmed the potential of Du-Wett to markedly reduce spray volumes on grapevines, but highlighted the importance of matching organosilicone adjuvant concentration with application volume to achieve improved spray retention and distribution (Tables 2 & 3).
 Traditionally, spray tank adjuvant recommendations are given in terms of percentage volume of adjuvant in the spray (% v/v), but recent studies with organosilicones have suggested that recommendations based on volume per area (litres/ha) may be a better way of prescribing these adjuvants (Humble & Burga 2001; Gaskin et al 2000a, 2001b).
 Results from this study endorse that recommendation.

 Generally, on easy-to-wet foliage, sprays were retained better at lower spray volumes, especially on the exposed bunch-line (Table 2).
 Greatest retention was with 0.4 litres/ha of Du-Wett, applied in 200 litres/ha spray volume, which was significantly better than with high volumes of Citowett spray (P<0.05).
 When the Du-Wett rate was >0.4 litres/ha or the spray volume >200 litres/ha, then retention was reduced.
 The increased risk of spray run-off when using a superwetter in high volume sprays is illustrated, with Citowett generally providing better retention than Du-Wett when applied in �400 litres/ha.
 The leaf position (inner vs outer) had no significant effect on spray distribution in this open- � 2002 New Zealand Plant Protection Society (Inc.) www.nzpps.org Refer to http://www.nzpps.org/terms_of_use.html Application Technology 157 leaf canopy (P>0.05).
 Spray was targeted at mature fruit in the bunch line and as expected, the height position of leaves on the canopy was highly significant (P<0.0001).
 More spray was retained on foliage at the low bunch line position than at the mid-canopy, which in turn captured more spray than the upper canopy.
 This may also be a function of recapturing run-off from foliage above.
 The low-volume/low-rate Du-Wett sprays (200 litres/0.2 litres/ha) were retained more by leaves at all heights in the canopy than were conventional high-volume Citowett sprays.
 On waxy grape bunches, the expected trend for better retention with higher volume of Citowett sprays was confirmed (Table 3).
 In contrast, Du-Wett spray was best retained at 200 litres/ha, using an adjuvant rate of 0.4 litres/ha.
 In general, decreasing spray volume increased the retention of Du-Wett sprays on bunches and greater or equal amounts of active ingredient were captured, at four times less the application volume, compared to Citowett sprays.
 The retention data on both foliage and bunches suggests that spray application volumes on wine grapes could be markedly reduced using organosilicone adjuvants without compromising pesticide efficacy.
 Application volumes should be �200 litres/ha to maximise spray retention and distribution.
 Du-Wett rates should be lower in sprays targeting foliage than for those directed at grape bunches.
 Higher rates of Du-Wett may be beneficial as canopy density or bunch size and complexity increase, but spray volumes should be minimised to prevent losses to runoff.

  The preliminary trial work on grapes described in this paper highlights both the potential and some of the problems that are likely to be encountered in the use of adjuvants.
 The application rates required for organosilicone adjuvants are a relatively complex function of agrochemical mixes and rates, spray application volumes, canopy type and the target canopy tissues (leaves, wood or bunches of fruit).
 Extensive vineyard trials to determine the field performances of Du-Wett and Bond Xtra on a variety of grape canopies are currently underway.
 The results of these will be used to develop prescriptions for adjuvant use that will allow growers to maximise the pest and disease control potential of their agrochemicals, while improving the cost-effectiveness of their spray applications.
 Adjuvants and surfactants are spray solution additives, and are considered to be any product added to a pesticide solution to improve the performance of the spray mixture.
 Adjuvants are not under the same registration guidelines as are pesticides.
 The Environmental Protection Agency does not register or approve the labeling of spray adjuvants.
 Surfactants (surface active agents) are a type of adjuvant designed to enhance the absorbing, emulsifying, dispersing, spreading, sticking, wetting, or penetrating properties of pesticides.
 Surfactants are most often used with herbicides to help a pesticide spread over a leaf surface and penetrate the waxy cuticle of a leaf or to penetrate through the small hairs present on a leaf surface.
 Surfactant Class Definitions Definitions
 � Non-ionic surfactants are composed of alcohols and/or fatty acids and are compatible with most pesticides.
 This class of surfactant reduces surface tension and improves spreading, sticking, and pesticide uptake.
 � Crop oil concentrates are composed of paraffinbased petroleum oil and surfactants.
 Crop oil concentrates reduce surface tension and improve herbicide uptake and leaf surface spreading.
 � Nitrogen-surfactant blends consist of premix combinations of various forms of nitrogen and surfactants.
 They generally are used with herbicides recommending the addition of ammonium sulfate or or

 28% nitrogen.
 These surfactants reduce surface tension and improve leaf surface spreading.
 � Esterified seed oils are produced by reacting fatty acids from seed oils with an alcohol to form esters.
 The methyl or ethyl esters produced by this reaction are combined with surfactants/ emulsifiers to form an esterified seed oil.
 These surfactants reduce surface tension and improve herbicide uptake by improving herbicide distribution on the leaf surface.
 � Organo-silicones are usually silicone/surfactant blends of silicone to non-ionic or other surfactants:
 a few within this classification are composed entirely of silicone.
 These surfactants provide a tremendous reduction in surface tension and spread more than conventional surfactants.
 In addition, this class of surfactants provide improved effectiveness through maximum rainfastness.
 Overcoming pesticide water solubility issues was a monumental task in the 1950s and 60s.
 Most pesticides were not formulated to use water as their carrier.
 Today, however, the majority of pesticides are formulated to use water.
 The waxy surfaces of many insects, fungi, and plants make it difficult for most water-based spray solutions to penetrate their target.
 To overcome this barrier, adjuvants have been developed.
 Adjuvants can determine how well a pesticide works but, when used inappropriately, they can cause crop damage.
 Adjuvant is a broad term describing any additive to a spray tank that enhances pesticide activity.
 Examples of adjuvants are surfactants, spreader stickers, crop oils, anti-foaming materials, buffering agents, and compatibility agents.
 Surfactants are adjuvants that facilitate and accentuate the emulsifying, dispersing, spreading, wetting, or other surface modifying properties of liquids.
 Many pesticides require the addition of an adjuvant, and some do not.
 When applying fungicides, insecticides or herbicides without a recommended adjuvant, 30 percent to 50 percent reduction in pest control can be expected.
 Adjuvants may cause damage to a plant if the wrong adjuvant is used or if it is used at too high a concentration.
 Using the correct adjuvant on a greenhouse crop is a critical decision.
 This bulletin is intended to describe how adjuvants differ and what adjuvants are best to use.
 How Do Adjuvants Work?
 To understand how adjuvants work, it helps to understand how water works.
 Each water molecule is bipolar, meaning it has a negative and a positive charge, very much like a magnet.
 If you put several water molecules together, the positive and negative forces attract each other (Figure 1) .
 The interacting charges of water molecules (oxygen represented in blue - negatively charged and hydrogen represented in red - positively charged).
 Components of a surfactant molecule.
 The molecules on the surface of a water droplet are held together with more force than those of the interior water molecules.
 This causes surface tension, which can prevent many things from going into solution and getting wet.
 Surfactants overcome surface tension.
 Most surfactants have a water-loving polar head (hydrophilic head) and water-hating non-polar tail (hydrophobic tail) (Figure 2).
 These components of a surfactant molecule help break water surface tension, allowing the pesticide to be more evenly dispersed on a surface and to reach its target.
 When water molecules come into contact with unlike substances, several things may happen.
 If the substances have a similar charge, the two forces repel each others.
 If they have different charges, the two forces will attract each other.
 If there are no charges, there will be no reaction.
 Water, when placed on most hydrophobic surfaces, will bead.
 This beading is caused by surface tension, and this surface tension can be reduced by the addition of surfactants (Figure 3).
 Water beads and how they are affected by surfactants.
 Horticultural oil / dishwashing liquid damage to pansies.
 The lower the surface tension in a pesticide solution, the better the pesticide coverage, allowing more pesticide to reach its target.
 It�s important to know which adjuvant is best.
 For instance, one day we received a panicked call from a grower who indicated that his pansy crop was in trouble.
 Earlier that day he discovered his crop had a serious aphid infestation.
 He sprayed thoroughly, but he soon found that his efforts were futile, as the spray droplets ran off the foliage.
 Rather than investigate or consult, the grower decided to use horticultural oil with the insecticide and spray again.
 It was late in the afternoon, hot and sunny.
 the leaves of the pansies started wilting.
 Panicked, he decided to apply a commonly used household dishwashing liquid solution to the pansies to rinse off the oil, knowing soaps dissolve oils.
 By the time he called for assistance, 1,300 flats of pansies were already dissolving into small blobs of dark, black-green slime (Figure 4).
 Horticultural oil damage to pansy flower and foliage.Had the grower read the label, the horticultural oil he used clearly indicated it was a penetrating type oil to be used only on fruit crops, ornamental trees and shrubs when they are dormant (not on actively growing foliage).
 In hot weather oils can be very damaging to plants (Figure 5).
 This unfortunate incident could have been prevented if the person applying the pesticide had taken time to read the label.
 When explosive thrips and viral epidemics occur or insect resistance to pesticides increases, many growers are desperate and easily tempted to use any handy surfactant wetting agent.
 The science of adjuvant technology has increased the effectiveness of our pesticides, but only when used properly.
 The following is a general review of the types of adjuvants on the market, including how they work and what damage may occur when they are not used properly.
 For specific information on greenhouse-labeled products, please contact your county extension agent or manufacturer and read the labels carefully before using them.
 Today, there are close to 400 adjuvant related products including surfactants, wetting agents, and other adjuvant related products on the market, and only a small percentage of these are suitable or labeled for greenhouse use.
 Adjuvants versus Surfactants Surfactants
 Surfactants are adjuvants that reduce surface tension within the external surface layers of water.
 There are four different types of surfactants:
 Anionic Surfactants are negatively charged, and enhance foaming and other spreading properties.
 For example, shampoo for hair contains sodium or ammonium laureth sulfate, which is the preferred anionic surfactant for hair.
 Using an anionic surfactant in the greenhouse can cause problems with sprayers that have an agitator, or any system where the foam could disrupt water flow or pump suction.
 Cationic Surfactants are positively charged, and are often very toxic to plants as they can disrupt membrane ion balance.
 Cationic surfactants are not widely used for pest control, but they are more commonly used in heavy-duty cleaning compounds.
 Don�t grab a bottle of engine wash surfactant used to clean the tractor and add it to your pesticides when spraying Easter lilies.
 The results can be devastating.
 Amphoteric Surfactants are unusual in that they will form either a positive or negative charge in water, depending upon the pH of the solution.
 Their use in horticulture crop protection is rare.
 These products are used very specifically to match the properties of specific pesticide formulations to carrier components or other materials, and are generally not available for use in the greenhouse as a stand-alone product.
 Nonionic Surfactants do not have a charge in solution and are the most commonly used surfactants for the horticulture industry.
 When used properly, they as a class do not harm plants, remain stable, and do a good job of breaking water surface tension.
 However, application rate is critical.
 When applied at too high a rate plant injury may result (Figure 6).
 Nonionic surfactant damage to pansy (Viola spp.), Note regrowth.
 The effect of excess soil wetting agent on pansy (Viola spp.) foliage.
 Nonionic surfactants are now being researched in relation to controlling fungal infection, especially in hydroponic systems.
 When a fungal zoospore is coated with a nonionic surfactant, it does not function well.
 Dr. Ann Chase (pathologist at the University of Florida) and others are currently reviewing the effect of these products on fungi.
 Wetting Agents are commonly mixed in growing media.
 They allow the media, such as peat moss, which is often hydrophobic (water-hating) when dry, to accept water into its collective structure.
 Wetting agents work much like surfactants, breaking the surface tension of water and helping the water transfer from particle to particle.
 However, their chemistry is different from most surfactants.
 Many are made up of polyoxyethylene esters, ethoxy sulfates, or derivations of these components mixed with nonionic surfactants.
 When applied at too high a rate, a wetting agent can cause membrane permeability problems and cause toxicities that kill roots and leaves (Figure 7).
 Occasionally, media from commercial companies contain too much wetting agent.
 This can cause disfigured, off-color, slow growing plants.
 Temperature and weather can affect how the plant will react to the presence of a large amount of wetting agent in bark or peat soils.
 Penetrants dissolve or penetrate waxy layers on leaves and allow other chemicals to interface with plant cells or insect epidermal tissue and enter the spaces between the epidermal cells, sometimes called �cell free space.� Penetrants can contain petroleum by-products, crop oils, complex alcohols, and other hydrocarbon-based materials.
 They work well under very specific conditions and with very specific crops grown outdoors.
 In the greenhouse, stand-alone products are rare.
 Greenhouse walls made of various films, especially in poly houses with poor ventilation, have condensate problems and drip in the most inopportune places.
 Anti-condensates act like surfactants, making it easier for water to spread throughout the surface of the film instead of collecting as droplets on the plastic and dripping on plants.
 By creating a film, the water can be carried off as a thin sheet along the pipe or plastic film.
 They work great, but should never, ever be used on plants or on soil.
 Thickeners are used to reduce drift of sprays sprays
 They may contain polyacrylamide, polyethylene polymers, polysaccharides (long-chain sugars), or vegetable oils.
 These products not only help volatile pesticides become less volatile, they also cause the carrier solution to become more viscous and heavier.
 This is beneficial when spraying an outdoor production area near a housing subdivision.
 It reduces drift, odor, and waste.
 However, when thickeners are applied at too high a dosage, they can cause surface deposits on foliage, excessive exposure to the pesticide, or clog spray nozzles.
 Use these adjuvants only in outdoor situations and only after reading the label for information about compatibility and phytotoxicity.
 Emulsifier agents work by coating tiny particles or groups of the liquid molecules and preventing them from coagulating with other like molecules.
 Unlike oil and vinegar, the emulsifiers allow oil and water solutions to mix.
 These products are usually added by the manufacturer and are commonly mixed with petroleum-based pesticides to help them mix more readily with water.
 Spreader and Stickers Stickers
 Spreaders are compounds that cause the surface tension of the pesticide to be reduced in such a way that it easily spreads into a very thin film over a surface.
 Like surfactants, spreaders and stickers increase the efficiency of the pesticide dramatically.
 They may contain fatty acids, latex, aliphatic alcohols, crop oils such as cottonseed, or inorganic oils.
 Each formulation is very different.
 Stickers are very much like thickening agents or oils in that they cause the pesticide solution to adhere to the leaf surface, resisting rain, evaporation and runoff.
 Some products use emulsified polyetheylenes, others use polymerized resins, fatty acids or petroleum distillates.
 Stickers are commonly used in field crops (like corn and soybeans) where residue on leaves is not a problem.
 However, in greenhouses, they can cause a mess, especially on leaves with indentations such as Pileas, or hairy plants such as Dusty Miller.
 Some spreader/sticker combinations cause phytoxicity in tender annuals and herbs.
 There are two types of oil:
 crop oils that are derived from soybean and other crops, and inorganic oils that come from petroleum refineries.
 Some are used as suffocates, which cover the insect and cut of its air supply.
 Others are used as penetrants to break apart the chitin layers (such as with scales) and cause the insect to die.
 Still others are used like surfactants, forming film over the leaf, breaking down the cuticle, and allowing the pesticide to enter its target.
 Some oils are blended with surfactants, to take advantage of the properties of both adjuvants.
 Oils are rarely recommended for greenhouse use.
 Alkyl polyglucosides.
 As complex as this term sounds, it simply refers to modified sugars.
 It has been found that some modified sugar molecules have surfactant-like properties and may be used as spreader/stickers.
 Although this class of adjuvant has been around for some time, it is only now becoming popular due to its organic origins, biodegradability, and the fact that it is environmentally friendly.
 There are low foaming and high foaming types, and many are very good wetting agents.
 Originally developed as environmentally safe cleaning agents (car wash cleaners) in England, they have transitioned to being used in laundry detergents and as agronomic adjuvants.
 These products have very low potential for phytotoxicity because they are derived from plant sugars.
 Research on these materials is on-going.
 Current work indicates they work well with glyphosate herbicide.
 Organosilicone surfact damage to pansy (Viola spp.) leaves when applied in hot (>90�F) sunny weather.Organosilicates are not exactly new; they were developed in the 1970s, and have many uses including silicone-based sprays for waterproofing.
 About 10 years ago, their use as spray adjuvants for crop production was discovered.
 Organosilicate surfactants are very good at increasing the �rainfastness� of pesticides.
 They also reduce the surface tension and allow everything from micronutrients to fungicides to enter the leaf stomates.
 These products have phenomenal wetting abilities.
 Depending on the pesticide they are used with and the application rate, results may be good or bad, so be careful when using these products.
 Phytotoxicity can occur if these products are used at too high a rate or used when temperatures are above 90 degrees F.
 Some research suggests that the wetting properties of these surfactants are so good that they can also allow bacteria and fungi to more easily invade plants (via stomata).
 A sanitary facility, careful applications, and rotation with other surfactants is required to realize the benefits with these products.
 Applications of organosilicone surfactants in 90+ degree F weather can cause plant damage (Figure 8).
 There is continuing research on the use of certain inorganic salts as surfactants.
 However, most of this work is related to herbicide applications.
 Many of these products are salts of sodium, potassium and ammonium.
 Others contain calcium, iron, zinc and magnesium salts and are used in industrial cleaning agents and adjuvants.
 They also cause plant problems, particularly on greenhouse crops.
 So Why Not Just Use Common Kitchen Soaps and Detergents?
 There are very few adjuvant �soaps� on the market today.
 Most soaps are in bars and are used for bathing.
 Also, soaps react with cations in soil and fertilizer and can leave a precipitate residue on foliage.
 Most greenhouse workers remember gray precipitate on foliage resulting from soap residue.
 Today, dishwashing liquids contain both anionic and nonionic surfactants.
 In most circumstances, their combined effects are synergistic and very potent.
 None are labeled for use on plants.
 Natural Surfactants Surfactants
 Natural surfactants are biodegradable, wetting agents and oils that are processed differently from �crop oils� and alkylated sugars.
 Materials such as coconut oils, palm oils, castor oils, lanolins, wheat amino acids, and many others have been used in the past, but there is little research to verify these products are effective when used in combination with pesticides or in a greenhouses environment.
 Furthermore, there is evidence that these products may serve as food sources for bacteria and fungi.
 Until research gives us confidence in these products, exercise caution when using them.
 Bottom Line?
 Certain pesticides are recommended to be applied with oils, others with only non-ionic surfactants.
 The pesticide label specifies whether an adjuvant is needed and which class of adjuvants to use.
 These recommendations are strict for a reason.
 Experimenting with surfactants is a risky business.
 If, after reading the label, you are still unclear about which adjuvant to use, ask the company that produces the pesticide.
 They will tell you if a surfactant is present in the pesticide or which surfactant products can safely be used with the pesticide.
 There has been much research conducted with adjuvants and adjuvant / pesticide interaction.
 Most pesticides have specific requirements.
 So after you spend a few hundred dollars for a pint of pesticide, ask yourself, �Do I want this product to work?� Add the recommended adjuvant! adjuvant!
 Below is a list of a few distributors and retailers of adjuvants at the time of this publication release.
 Consult the World Wide Web for additional adjuvant availability.
  Trade and brand names are used only for information.
 The Cooperative Extension Service, University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences does not guarantee nor warrant published standards on any product mentioned; neither does the use of a trade or brand name imply approval of any product to the exclusion of others which may also be suitable.

 The best way to minimize the threat of West Nile virus is to control mosquito populations and prevent exposure to mosquitoes.
 To protect yourself from mosquito bites, wear long sleeved shirts and long pants when in mosquito-infested areas.
 You may also consider using mosquito repellents.
 Mosquito Larvicides Larvicides
 Additional control methods may be needed if mosquito populations rise above acceptable levels.
 Applying a larvicide, such as Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis (Bti), may be the next best way to control mosquitoes.
 Larvicides kill mosquito larvae.
 Killing mosquito larvae before they emerge as adults can reduce or eliminate the need for ground or aerial application of pesticides to kill adult mosquitoes.
 Washington State Department of Agriculture has a list of pesticide products registered in Washington for use on mosquito larvae and adults.
 However, many of these products may require a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit from the state departments of Ecology or Health.
 Further, certain ingredients, such as malathion or temephos, can only be used for larval control when allowed in emergency situations.

 ISAA Conference Presentations and Posters � Highlights Highlights

 Tags:ISAA, pesticide, surfactant, adjuvant, glyphosate,Bayer CropScience CropScience
 A number of papers and posters were devoted to the use of surfactants and other adjuvants to enhance biological activity of pesticides by various modes of action such as:
 * Reducing the dynamic surface tension of spray droplets droplets
 * Reducing the contact angle between spray droplets and leaf surfaces surfaces
 * Increasing the retention and spreading of droplets on leaf surfaces surfaces
 * Increasing translocation and uptake of pesticides into plant leaves leaves
 Many surfactants are available to achieve these effects either alone or in admixture with mineral or vegetable oils.
 Nonionic surfactants (NIS) are often used as adjuvants by adding them to pesticide formulations, or by adding them to spray tank mixtures.
 Nonionic surfactants of the ethyleneoxide condensate type (ethoxylates) are popular because they are available in a wide HLB range from non-polar to very polar with increasing solubility in water.
 Researchers develop the optimum bioenhanced pesticide formulation by testing for product physical properties and biological efficacy.
 In the USA many surfactant and oil based mixtures are made for tank mixing with pesticide formulations.
 This approach gives farmers a greater degree of freedom to select the optimum mixture for their application.
 In the USA tank mix adjuvants do not require EPA approval in the same way as pesticide formulations.
 However, it is necessary to test the adjuvants with pesticide products in order to get a label approval for use application.
 The situation in Europe is that adjuvants are usually built in to formulations so that farmers get an optimised product in a single pack.
 Registration of the whole formulation, including the adjuvant, is necessary in European countries.
 Superspreaders Superspreaders
 Spreading of trisiloxane surfactant solutions on hydrophobic surfaces such as plant leaves has been discussed in scientific literature for more than 20 years and can significantly improve the spreading of pesticide formulations.
 A popular superspreader used as a tank mix additive is Silwet L-77 supplied by a number of adjuvant companies.
 This can result in leaf coverage that is 10-30 times greater than with conventional surfactants.
 Evonik have developed a new product based on a mixture of a trisiloxane superspreader with an acrylate emulsion sticker.
 Surfactants and solvents with low toxicity and environmental impact impact
 Under increasing pressure from registration authorities many companies are now looking for surfactants and solvents with low environmental impact and low toxicity to mammals, especially for skin and eye irritation.
 The aim is to register products with few if any hazard and caution symbols on the product labels, and ultimately to have �Clean Labels�.
 This trend has meant that alcohol ethoxylate surfactants have been developed by many surfactant companies to replace nonylphenol ethoxylate surfactant (NPE�s) in pesticide formulations, especially in Europe.
 NPE�s are still used in the USA but are now being reviewed by the EPA.
 Replacements are also being developed to replace NMP as a co-solvent in many EC formulations.
 Rhodia introduced a new polar co-solvent called Rhodiasolv PolarClean which is suitable for a number of active ingredients.
 The new solvent is non-flammable, has a high boiling point of 280�C and a low freezing point of -60�C.
 It also has no VOC problems.
 Surfactants based on natural sustainable materials materials
 Alkylpolyglucosides (APG) have been developed by many surfactant companies as low toxicity surfactants made from sustainable materials.
 They exhibit low dynamic surface tension and are used as built-in adjuvants for pesticide formulations as well as for tank mixes.
 A range of more hydrophobic (lipophilic) surfactants based on ethoxylated aducts of saccharose has been developed by Cognis.
 Esterification of these materials leads to a new class of label-free non-ionic surfactants which are very effective at enhancing the biological activity of pesticides.
 These new surfactants have good toxicological and ecotoxicological profiles and can be added to the formulation or to the spray tank.
 Adjuvants for glyphosate to replace TAMEO TAMEO
 Tallowamine ethoxylate adjuvants (TAMEO) have been used for many years as the standard surfactant to enhance the biological activity of glyphosate formulations.
 However, TAMEO has become a problem due to its aquatic toxicity and eye irritancy.
 Surfactant companies have now developed a number of safer adjuvants which can replace tallowamine ethoxylate in glyphosate formulations.
 For example, APG�s can be mixed with alcohol ethoxylates to give satisfactory biological activity in glyphosate formulations.
 Monsanto, Syngenta and other companies have done considerable work in this area and have patented their preferred adjuvants and mixtures for glyphosate.
 Standard formulations of glyphosate at 360 g/l of glyphosate acid are based on the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate acid.
 It was not possible to make high strength formulations with the isopropylamine salt, so other salts such as the ammonium salt or the potassium salt of glyphosate acid up to 540 g/l of glyphosate acid have been developed.
 These formulations also require suitable surfactant adjuvants.
 Surfactants for OD formulations formulations
 Most dispersions of pesticide particles are suspended in water to produce suspension concentrates (SC) formulations.
 However, some active ingredients such as sulfonylurea herbicides are not stable in water and need to be dispersed in an oil medium.
 These are known as OD formulations and require special surfactant dispersing agents for a non-aqueous medium.
 Bayer CropScience developed suitable formulations using dioctyl suphosuccinates as dispersing agents.
 Other dispersing systems with oil soluble dispersing agents are possible.
 Evonik have developed an OD formulation of nicosulfuron using dispersing agents based on modified phosphate polyethers or aliphatic fatty acid derivatives.
 Evonik also has a new thickener for OD formulations called Aerosil 380.
 OD formulations are claimed to have enhanced activity due to the spreading effect of the oils in the formulation.

 Abstract Abstract
 Many factors, including adjuvants, pesticide formulations, and nozzle tips, affect spray droplet size.
 It is important to understand these factors as spray droplet size affects both drift and efficacy of pesticides, which is a main concern with pesticide application.
 A laser particle analyzer was used to determine the spray droplet size and distributions of a range of formulations sprayed through several types of nozzle tips.
 Nozzles included were extended range flat fan sizes 11003 and 11005 (Spraying Systems XR), air induction flat fan sizes 11005 and 11004 (AI), air induction extended range flat fan size 11005 (AIXR), preorifice flat fan size 11005 (TT), and a second preorifice flat fan size 2.5 (TF).
 Several deposition/retention adjuvants were studied, including Array, Interlock, In-Place, and Thrust.
 Another study looked at diflufenzopyr + dicamba (Status, BASF) in combination with several adjuvants.
 Also, three fungicides were evaluated at differing spray volumes.
 Results indicated that the droplet size of some nozzle tips is more affected than others by changes in the contents of the spray solution.
 Legislative Controls over Adjuvants Adjuvants
 The legal controls governing adjuvants are set out in paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 of the Control of Pesticides (Amendment) Regulations (COPR) 1997 and The Plant Protection Products Regulations (PPPR) 2005 and are limited to controlling the use of adjuvants with pesticides.
 The Regulations do not control the advertisement, sale, supply, or storage of adjuvant products but other legislation may apply (see below).
 Schedule 3 of COPR permits the use of an adjuvant in conjunction with a pesticide only if that adjuvant has been specified in the 'Official List' (see below) published by Ministers.
 The use of an adjuvant with a pesticide must be in accordance with the conditions of approval of the pesticide and any additional conditions of use of the adjuvant with that pesticide, as specified on the published List.
 Applications for inclusion of an adjuvant on the Official List are considered by CRD (details can be found in The Applicant Guide) with the risk assessment made for any prospective 'List Entry' (see below) limited to the use of the adjuvant with the pesticide.
 There is no evaluation of storage stability, efficacy, or crop safety (an advisory phrase stating that �The adjuvant / pesticide combinations listed have not been assessed by CRD for effectiveness or crop safety' is included in the publication of the Official List.).
 However, it should be noted that where a �positive� recommendation is made on a pesticide label for use of the pesticide/adjuvant mixture, efficacy data are required as part of the application for approval of the pesticide to support the recommendation.
 Further details on pesticide tank-mix recommendations are given in The Applicant Guide.
 General guidance on the controls is set out in the �All Approval Holders Letter� issued on 20 March 1998 (AAHL/7/98), �ADJUVANT LIST AND CONTROLS�.
 The Regulations enable Ministers to :
 a) Set certain data requirements which have to be met in order for an adjuvant to appear on the Official List.
 These data requirements form the basis of the application evaluated by CRD to determine the safe conditions of use of the adjuvant with a pesticide.
 b) Determine the conditions to which the use of the adjuvant with a pesticide are subject i.e.
 specify the conditions of use published on the List Entry for each adjuvant product.
 These may be amended for safety reasons or at the request of the applicant.
 c) Set further requirements which may be amended in the light of available information relating to the use of the adjuvant with approved pesticides.
 This may result from a review of an individual or group of adjuvants.
 There is no option for provisional listing of an adjuvant (as there is for provisional approval of a pesticide).
 A listing cannot be given subject to further confirmatory data requirements being set.
 If an adjuvant fails to pass a review, the product may be removed from the Official List.
 It cannot remain on the Official List while further data are generated.
 d) Remove an adjuvant from the Official List for a variety of reasons:
 if the applicant fails to comply with any data requirements (as part of an application for Official Listing, or review) review)
 if any relevant product literature is not in accordance either with the published conditions of use of the adjuvant, or the approval of the pesticide (relevant literature includes the product labelling, any accompanying leaflet, or any other literature describing the product produced by the Applicant); Applicant);
 for safety reasons; reasons; at the request of the applicant company.
 This guidance does not apply to an adjuvant which is to be supplied and marketed together with the pesticide for mixing before use (e.g. as a �twin-pack�).
 In such cases, it is considered to be part of the approved pesticide product.
 Whether or not that particular adjuvant is on the Official List, the pesticide/adjuvant combination must be considered by CRD for safety and efficacy as part of the application for approval of the pesticide product.
 CRD's Applicant Enquiry Team can be contacted for advice if necessary.
 It should be noted that Council Directive 99/45/EC relating to the classification packaging and labelling of dangerous substances and preparations has been implemented by the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2009 (CHIP 4).
 Adjuvant products come under the definition of general preparations and hence these products should be classified and labelled in accordance with CHIP 4.
 Applicants can also gain further advice on the classification and labelling of adjuvants under CHIP 4 on the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) website.
 Definition of an 'Adjuvant' 'Adjuvant'
 Under Schedule 3, 5(5) of COPR and PPPR an adjuvant is defined as:
 �A substance other than water, without significant pesticidal properties, which enhances or is intended to enhance the effectiveness of a pesticide when it has been added to that pesticide�.
 Products of the following types are considered by CRD to fall within this definition of an adjuvant:
 CRD does not regulate other types of spray additives, such as dyes, markers, carriers, anti-transpirants or anti-foaming agents, as adjuvants.
 The Official List consists of the adjuvant products which may be used with pesticides and the conditions of use to which they are subjected.
 The conditions relating to each product are set out in the List Entry (further details on these conditions are given below).
 The Official List is published in full on the CRD (pesticides) website in www.pesticides.gov.uk, any additions and amendments are updated monthly on the website.
 Copies of individual List Entries are available on request from CRD's Plant Protection Products Information Section in York.
 A copy of the List Entry will be sent to the Applicant upon issue.
 To add a new product to the Official List, or to amend the conditions of an existing List Entry, an application must be submitted with all the necessary data to show that the adjuvant itself is safe to use, and is also safe to use when mixed with the proposed pesticide products.
 All applications will be processed by the Secretariat procedure in a similar way to pesticides.
 For further information on how applications are processed see The Applicant Guide.
  the �identity� of the product (i.e. tradename, ADJ (registration) number, Applicant and formulation details); and, and,
 the conditions of use with which a user must comply when using the adjuvant with a pesticide.
 These are in addition to complying with the conditions of use as specified on the pesticide product label; and, and,
 the expiry date(s) for the conditions of the previous List Entry where a new List Entry has superseded the former or where a product has been withdrawn from the List.
 The List Entry will be sent to the Applicant at the successful conclusion of the evaluation and published as part of the Official List.
  Any change to the tradename requires an application to amend the List Entry.
  The Applicant as specified in the Official Listing, has a different definition to that used for approval of pesticides.
 The role of the Applicant company is described in the Regulations as:
 the party making the application to include an adjuvant on the List List
 the party responsible for meeting any data requirement requirement
 the party responsible for any literature produced directly on their behalf behalf
 the party who may request to have an adjuvant removed from the List List
 Any change of the Applicant requires an application to amend the List Entry.
 It is recognised that some Applicants may choose to make an application via a third party.
 In this case, the Applicant must submit a signed declaration stating that the third party is acting on their behalf (Appendix 2).
 It should be noted that there are no legal controls over companies marketing adjuvants (unless they are also the Applicant company).
 Marketing company details are not included on the List Entry and notification of changes to these companies are not required.
 Formulation Formulation
 The formulation details referenced on the List Entry will refer to the specification of the �effective adjuvant component' and the �recipe� of the formulation (as detailed in Part E of the application form).
 Any changes to the formulation must be the subject of an application to CRD.
 The Applicant must propose which constituent(s) in the formulation should be specified as the �effective adjuvant component(s)�.
 This is defined as the constituent(s) which is/are primarily responsible for giving the product the properties of an extending, wetting, sticking or fogging agent.
 Their identity and quantity will be the only part of the (otherwise confidential) formulation details which will be specified in the published List Entry.
 ADJ Number Number
 This is the unique registration number for the adjuvant and will be allocated upon the first List Entry for that product.
 It will change where there is a change in the product tradename or Applicant, or where the nature of the adjuvant changes.
 List Entry Number Number
 This is the unique number for the specific List Entry issued following evaluation of an application.
 A new List Entry number will be allocated each time a new List Entry is issued.
 Controls on Sale, Supply and Advertisement of Adjuvants Adjuvants
 As described above, there are no legal controls over the marketing and advertisement of adjuvants, and therefore no direct control over the content of product labels, other literature or the containers in which the product is marketed.
 However an adjuvant may be removed from the List if the label or any other relevant literature promotes the use of an adjuvant with a pesticide in a way that would either contravene the conditions of use of the adjuvant as detailed on the List, or the pesticide approval(s).
 We do not approve adjuvant labels, and there is therefore no requirement to submit labels for consideration.
 However, in order to illustrate the proposed recommendations for use of the adjuvant, Applicants may submit labels (or otherwise provide this information in the covering letter or separate document).
 Irrespective of whether labels are submitted, CRD may, in the letter accompanying the List Entry, provide advice on label text referring to the use of the adjuvant.
 We will also notify List Entry holders when general labelling requirements are imposed under other non-pesticide specific legislation.
 Controls on Storage of Adjuvants Adjuvants
 There are no legal controls over the storage of adjuvant products.
 As detailed above, CRD does not control the container in which the product is marketed and therefore also do not consider the effect of packaging on the storage properties of the product.
 However, other legislation may also apply (see below).
 Controls on Use of Adjuvants Adjuvants
 Control over the use of the adjuvant with the pesticide is interpreted as being at the point when the adjuvant is in physical contact with the pesticide.
 The List Entry will include specific conditions of use relating to controls over use as detailed below.
 Any change to these conditions require an application to amend the List Entry.
 �Field of Use� Use�
 This condition is dependent on the:
 'field of use� of the pesticides which are specified in the List Entry (e.g.
 agricultural, horticultural, forestry);.
 and and
 whether the particular adjuvant is an extending agent, wetting agent, sticking agent or fogging agent agent
 It will be stated in a format similar to the following example:
 �FOR USE ONLY AS AN AGRICULTURAL/HORTICULTURAL EXTENDING AGENT� AGENT�
 �Crops/Situations� and �Pesticides� �Pesticides�
 This sets out the crops/situations where an adjuvant may be used and the pesticides with which it may be used.
 These will be dependent on the conclusions of the risk assessment made by consideration of data and other information submitted to support the List Entry.
 The residues data (or cases submitted in lieu of actual data) will be particularly relevant to this (see Residues data requirements).
 �Maximum Number of Treatments� and �Latest Time of Application� Application�
 These are both dependent on the pesticide approval.
 The List Entry states �Follow the statutory conditions of use of the pesticide�.
 �Operator Protection� Protection�
 This condition relates to the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to be worn by the operator when using the adjuvant with a pesticide.
 Every List Entry states that operators must follow all operator protection instructions for the pesticide.
 Where the personal protective equipment specified on the adjuvant label is different to that specified on the pesticide label, the higher level of protective equipment must be worn.
 CRD have no legal controls on the engineering controls or PPE which may be required for the handling of the adjuvant concentrate prior to use with the pesticide.
 Such conditions are therefore not included as a condition in the List Entry.
 It is the responsibility of the applicant to classify and label their product in line with the CHIP 4 regulations.
 If the adjuvant carries a higher level of PPE and/or engineering controls following classification and labelling of the adjuvant under CHIP 4 the higher level of protection must be observed.
 �Other Specific Restrictions� Restrictions�
 Based on the consideration of the data and other information that support the List Entry, other restrictions which do not fall within the criteria listed above may be set to ensure safe use of the adjuvant.
 Other relevant legislation legislation
 The aspects that are not controlled under the Regulations (e.g.
 storage, operator protection prior to use, environmental and toxicological classification) may be controlled by other legislation:
 The Health and Safety at Work Act, 1974;and, 1974;and,
 The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (COSHH) 1999); and, and,
 The Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply Regulations, 2002 (CHIP 4).

 Guidelines on the provision of Pesticide Mixing Services and Sale of Pesticide Twin Packs and Kits Kits
 Pesticides include all materials that are used to prevent, destroy, repel, attract or reduce pest organisms.
 Insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and rodenticides are some of the more well-known pesticides.
 Less well-known pesticides include growth regulators, plant defoliants, surface disinfectants and some swimming pool chemicals.
 Under federal legislation, all pesticides used in Canada must be registered by Health Canada.
 Pesticide Names Names
 Pesticides can be named in three ways:
 by trade or brand name, by common name or active ingredient, and by chemical name.
 For example:
 Roundup = trade name of a herbicide product product
 glyphosate = common name of the active ingredient in Roundup Roundup
 N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine = chemical name of the active ingredient in Roundup Roundup
 More information on pesticide names is located on the Pesticides Names page of this website.

 Types of Pesticides Pesticides
 There are approximately 400 different pesticide active ingredients and approximately 7,600 pesticide products (Trade Names) registered for use in Canada.
 Each pesticide product contains one or more of the registered active ingredients.

 Pesticide Groups/Classifications Groups/Classifications
 Pesticides are grouped or classified according to the pests they control, their chemical structure, how/when they work, or their mode of action (site of action).
 Classification by Target Pest Species Species
 Most pesticides may be classified according to the pests they kill.
 The word ending or suffix -cide means to kill.
 The following types of pesticides are used to kill specific kinds of pests:
 Pesticide Target pest pest
 algicide algae algae
 avicide birds birds
 bactericide bacteria bacteria
 fungicide fungi fungi
 herbicide weeds weeds
 insecticide insects insects
 miticide mites mites
 molluscicide snails, slugs slugs
 nematicide nematodes nematodes
 piscicide fish fish
 rodenticide rodents rodents
 Top Top
 Classification by Chemical Structure Structure
 Pesticides can be grouped according to chemical structure.
 Pesticides with similar structures have similar characteristics and usually have a similar mode of action.
 Most pesticide active ingredients are either inorganic or organic pesticides.
 From a scientific view, inorganic pesticides do not contain carbon and are usually derived from mineral ores extracted from the earth.
 Examples of inorganic pesticides include copper sulphate, ferrous sulphate, copper and sulphur.
 Organic pesticides contain carbon in their chemical structure.
 Most organic compounds are created from various compounds, but a few are extracted from plant material and are called 'botanicals'.
 Examples of organic pesticides include:
 captan, pyrethrin, and glyphosate.
 Organic pesticides with similar structures are grouped into families of chemicals.
 Chemical families of the different active ingredients are listed in the Pesticide Name table or Resistance Management Group Tables.
 Top Top
 Grouped by How or When They Work Work
 Pesticides can also be classified according to how or when they work.
 Some groups that describe how or when pesticides work are:
 Contact pesticides generally control a pest as a result of direct contact.
 Insects are killed when sprayed directly or when they crawl across surfaces treated with a residual contact insecticide.
 Weed foliage is killed when enough surface area is covered with a contact herbicide.
 Systemic pesticides are pesticides which are absorbed by plants or animals and move to untreated tissues.
 Systemic or translocated herbicides move within the plant to untreated areas of leaves, stems or roots.
 They may kill weeds with only partial spray coverage.
 Systemic insecticides or fungicides move throughout treated plants and kill certain insects or fungi.
 Some systemic insecticides are applied to animals and move through the animal to control pests such as warble grubs, lice, or fleas.
 Some pesticides only move in one direction within the plant, either up or down.
 Knowing what direction the pesticide moves will help guide your decisions.
 For example some insecticides only move upwards in plants.
 If applied to the root zone, it will travel throughout the plant, but if applied to the leaves it will not move throughout the plant.
 Some pesticides are considered locally systemic.
 These will only move a short distance in a plant from the point of contact.
 Foliar pesticides are applied to plant leaves, stems and branches.
 Note, they may be either a contact pesticide or a systemic pesticide.
 Soil-applied pesticides are applied to the soil.
 Some are taken up by roots and translocated inside the plant.
 Other soil-applied herbicides kill weed seedlings by contact with young shoots or leaves as they break through the soil.
 Fumigants are chemicals that are applied as toxic gas or as a solid or liquid which forms a toxic gas.
 The gas will penetrate cracks and crevices of structures or soil or the spaces between products stored in containers.
 Preplant herbicides are applied to the soil before seeding or transplanting.
 Premergent herbicides are applied to the soil after planting but before emergence of the crop or weed.
 The pesticide label should indicate if a pesticide is preemergent to the crop or weed.
 Postemergent herbicides are applied after the crop or weed has emerged.
 Translocated herbicides enter the roots or above ground parts of plants and move within the plants.
 They are also called systemic herbicides.
 Eradicant fungicides destroy fungi that have already invaded plants and begun to damage plant tissues.
 They inhibit metabolic processes of growing fungal organisms.
 Protectant fungicides prevent fungal infections.
 They retard fungal growth or prevent the organisms from entering treated plants.
 They must be used before the fungi reach the infection stage.
 Once a plant s infected, the fungicide will normally not kill the fungi inside the plant.
 Selective pesticides will only control certain pests.
 Non-selective pesticides will control a wide range of pests.
 Suffocating insecticides clog the breathing system of insects and may affect eggs.
 Residual pesticides do not break down quickly and may control pests for a long time (i.e.
 several weeks or a year).
 Non-residual pesticides are quickly made inactive after application and do not affect future crops.
 Top Top
 Grouped by Mode of Action (Site of Action) Action)
 Pesticides can be grouped according to their mode of action or the way a pesticide destroys or controls the target pest.
 This is also referred to the primary site of action.
 For example, one insecticide may affect an insects nerves while another may affect moulting.
 One herbicide may mimic the plants growth regulators and another may affect the plants ability to convert light into food.
 One fungicide may affect cell division and another may slow the creation of an important compounds in the fungus.
 There are a limited number of different modes of action, but there are many pesticides.
 Some pesticides have the same mode of action.
 Scientists have grouped pesticides according to their mode of action or the target site of action.
 The major types of modes of action, for active ingredients registered in Canada, are listed in the Pesticide Resistance Management Groups.

 Types of Pesticide Formulations Formulations
 When a pesticide active ingredient (a.i.) is manufactured, it is not in a usable form.
 The a.i.
 may not mix will with water or may be unstable.
 Therefore the a.i.
 is mixed with other compounds to improve its effectiveness, safety, handling and storage.
 The other compounds can include solvents, mineral clays, stickers, wetting agents, or other adjuvants.
 This mixture of a.i.
 and inert (inactive) ingredients is called a pesticide formulation.
 Some formulations come ready to use while others must be mixed before use.
 One a.i.
 is often made into several different formulations.
 When choosing between formulations consider:
 If it registered for the use (pest/crop) (pest/crop)
 Which will be most effective against the pest and current life stage stage
 What formulation works best in your application equipment equipment
 Which will result in less drift or runoff runoff
 Whether the proper safety equipment available available
 Which is safest for workers, bystanders or nearby sensitive areas or organisms organisms
 The cost cost
 The trade name of a pesticide may tell you about the formulation.
 It may include an abbreviation of the formulation.
 For example WP means wettable powder; E or EC means emulsifiable concentrate.
 Not all companies use the same abbreviations.
 Check the label if you do not understand the abbreviation.
 The exact name and amount of a.i.
 in the formulation is listed beside the guarantee.
 Pesticide formulations can be divided into three main types:
 solids, liquids or gases.
 The most commonly used formulations are listed in the following table.
 The formulations abbreviation is shown below in parentheses.

 Adjuvants Adjuvants
 Adjuvants are materials added to a pesticide formulation or tank mix to increase the effectiveness or change the properties of the pesticide in the spray mix.
 They may improve the effectiveness of a pesticide by:
 Wetting the surface so the spray sticks better better
 Increasing or decreasing evaporation so it prevents the spray from drying too fast or help it dry quicker quicker
 Increasing absorption into the plant plant
 Making the spray droplets more uniform to improve coverage coverage
 Adjuvants which directly improve the efficacy or enhance performance of a pesticide must be registered by Health Canada before they can be used.
 These are called Activators or spray modifiers.
 They either modify or enhance the physical or chemical characteristics of the pesticide.
 Adjuvants which are activators or spray modifiers include:
 Surfactants which are used to improve the wetting, spreading, dispersing and emulsifying properties of pesticide mixtures mixtures
 Wetting agents which help wettable powders and dry flowables mix with water and stick on surfaces surfaces
 Spreaders which help pesticides form uniform coatings over treated surfaces surfaces
 Ammonium and Sulfate Salts which enhance the uptake of some pesticides in hard water water
 Oil based adjuvants which affect leaf surfaces to allow better contact with the pesticide pesticide
 Stickers which help pesticides resist being washed off by the rain rain
 Adjuvants which do not directly improve efficacy but widen the conditions when a pesticide can be used or maintain the integrity of the spray solution do not need to be registered by Health Canada.
 These are called Utility modifiers.
 Adjuvants which are utility modifiers include:
 Buffering agents which change the pH of the water to increase the dispersion or solubility of a pesticide.
 Antifoam agents which decrease the amount of foam in a spray tank.
 Compatibility agents which help pesticides mixed together in a tank blend uniformly.
 These are often used in herbicide/fertilizer tank mixes.
 Drift retardants or thickeners which are used to increase the size of spray droplet droplet
 When to Use an Adjuvant Adjuvants are either incorporated into the formulation by the manufacturer or may be added to the spray by the pesticide applicator.
 When using adjuvants, always follow label directions.
 The label will state specifically what the adjuvant can be used for and what products it can be used with.
 The label will also have directions for use and may list special restrictions.
 Pesticide labels state the adjuvants that can or must be used with the product.
 Using an adjuvant that is not on a pesticide label or not according to label directions may:
 Have no effect effect
 Reduce pest control control
 Cause injury to the crop.
 Adjuvants are substances used with a herbicide or other pesticide to enhance performance.
 Adjuvants may be added to the product at the time of formulation, or by the applicator to the spray mix just prior to treatment.
 Adjuvants include surfactants, compatability agents, anti-foaming agents and spray colorants (dyes), and drift control agents.
 Care should be taken when selecting an adjuvant.
 Herbicide performance can differ depending on what type of adjuvant is used.
 The herbicide label will state if specific surfactants are required and the amount (%) of active ingredient it must contain.
 Crop injury or reduced herbicide activity may occur if these guidelines are not followed.
 The intent of this publication is to list the different types of adjuvants used in pesticide application.
 In addition, this publication provides some background on how these materials aid in pesticide application and performance.
 It is not intended as a guide for selecting which adjuvant to use with a particular pesticide product.
 SURFACTANTS SURFACTANTS
 Surfactants (surface-active ingredients) are substances that improve the emulsifying, dispersing, spreading, wetting, or other surface modifying properties of liquids.
 A surfactant increases the spray coverage on the foliage.
 This helps more of the herbicide to be taken up in the plant.
 Surfactants include emulsifying agents, wetting agents (spreaders), crop oil concentrates, and stickers.
 Emulsifying Agents Agents
 An emulsion is a mixture of two incompletely mixed liquids, one of which is dispersed in the other.
 The surrounding liquid is called the continuous phase, while the dispersed liquid is known as the discontinuous phase.
 Emulsifying agents promote the suspension of one liquid in another.
 There are two types of emulsions used in the application of herbicides.
 The type more commonly used is the "oil-in-water" emulsion, in which water is the continuous phase.
 When using this type of emulsion, the consistency of the spray mixture is usually similar to water.
 The second type of emulsion is the "water-in-oil" emulsion, in which the oil is the continuous phase.
 These emulsions, also referred to as "invert" emulsions, are normally rather viscous.
 It seems that the character of the emulsifying agent is a large factor in determining the kind of emulsion that is formed.
 The "oil-in-water" emulsions are widely used in the formulation of herbicides to aid in getting an oil-soluble herbicide dispersed in a water mixture so that the active ingredient may be applied as a water spray.
 Invert emulsions are used to aid in drift control, to improve resistance of the herbicide treatment to the effects of weather (rain), to improve accuracy of delivery of the herbicide, and to enhance herbicide activity.
 Wetting Agents (Spreaders) (Spreaders)
 Wetting agents or spreaders are added to spray mixtures to decrease the surface tension of the mixture, causing a larger portion of each spray droplet to come into contact with the surface of the vegetation.
 This is done to increase the coverage and thus the effectiveness of the herbicide, although in some cases it may alter herbicide selectivity.
 There are four types of spreaders available:
 anionic, cationic, nonionic, and amphoteric.
 Anionic and cationic surfactants have electrical charges in water while nonionic surfactants do not have an overall electrical charge.
 Amphoteric may have positive or negative charges depending on the pH of the solution.
 Be sure that the type, if any, recommended in the herbicide label is selected.
 Most herbicides will recommend the use of a non-ionic type surfactant.
 Crop Oil Concentrates Concentrates
 A crop oil concentrate refers to products that contain 80 to 85% petroleum or vegetable oil plus 15 to 20% surfactant and emulsifiers.
 An emulsifiable oil generally refers to products that contain about 98% oil and 1 to 2% emulsifiers.
 This group is often called nonphytotoxic oils and phytobland oils.
 Silicone Surfactants Surfactants
 Silicone surfactants are silicone-based and provide a tremendous reduction in water surface tension at very low concentrations.
 Typical concentrations range from 0.10 to 0.25% on a volume/volume basis.
 Stickers Stickers
 Stickers are adjuvants that cause the herbicide to adhere to the plant foliage.
 They prevent runoff of the spray mixture from the target vegetation.
 By increasing the amount of spray remaining in contact with the vegetation and increasing the contact time of the herbicide, the desired result is an increase in the effectiveness of a herbicide application.
 Surfactant Selection Selection
 The numerous types of surfactants available often lead to confusion.
 The following suggestions will aid in selecting a suitable surfactant:
 Purchase a surfactant specifically manufactured and marketed for agricultural use.
 This is the case particularly for non-ionic surfactants, where only those sold specifically for pesticide use should be used.
 Purchase a surfactant on the basis of percentage active ingredient.
 For example, it is less profitable to purchase a product with 10% active ingredient at $4/gal than it is to purchase a product with 85% active ingredient at $12/gal.
 Isopropyl alcohol or water should not be considered as active ingredients.
 If the label on the container does not specifically state the percentage active ingredient in the container, ask the dealer for this information.
 Products manufactured for household use should not be used with herbicides.
 Be careful with claims that a surfactant may cost more, but can be used at lower concentrations than with conventional surfactants.
 Evidence does not exist that there is any one particular surfactant being marketed that is so effective that rates may be reduced and still obtain normal control.
 Ignore claims such as:
 the surfactant contains a silicone or some other agent that will help keep the spray equipment clean, or the surfactant increases water pentration into the soil, or the use of the surfactant will increase root penetration and nutrient uptake by the crop.
 There are no �miracle� surfactants.
 There are none that perform substantially better that justify a significant price increase.
 Some products are recommended to be used with certain surfactants.
 Consult the label for the approved list.
 COMPATIBILITY AGENTS AGENTS
 These adjuvants are used to aid in the suspension of herbicides when they are combined with other pesticides or fertilizers.
 They are used primarily when the carrier solution is a liquid fertilizer.
 ACIDIFIERS AND BUFFERS BUFFERS
 Acidifiers are acids that can be added to herbicide spray mixtures if there is a need to neutralize alkaline solutions and lower the pH.
 Acidifiers do not have a buffering action.
 Buffers are capable of changing the pH of a water solution to a certain level, which will be maintained even if the pH of the solution changes.
 ANTI-FOAMING AGENTS AND SPRAY COLORANTS COLORANTS
 An anti-foaming agent can eliminate the excess foam that can result when certain herbicide mixtures undergo mixing or agitation in the spray tank.
 Spray colorants are dyes that can be added to the spray tank so an applicator can see the areas that have been treated.
 DRIFT CONTROL AGENTS AGENTS
 Drift of herbicide sprays can be a problem when sensitive plants are in the vicinity of the site of application.
 One way to reduce herbicide drift is to increase the droplet size of the spray.
 Adjuvants (drift control agents) that are used to control drift do so in part by reducing the number of fine spray droplets.
 Thickeners may also be used as drift control agents.

 Timings Will Vary Vary
 These charts provide suggested approaches to IPM program timings.
 The timings of insect activity noted are a guide only, as activity can vary with different seasons.
 In general, activity commences earlier the further north the planting.
 Hence regular monitoring of orchards is essential.
 Understanding the Quality of New Technology Spray Oils Oils
 The quality of a spray oil is critical and will define two things:
 How effective it will work in assisting in the control of pests and diseases.
 How safe it will be to the plant and fruit.
 There is a lot of difference between available spray oils, with a number of factors influencing product quality.
 These in turn influence spray efficacy and plant safety.
 Understanding these details allows you to choose and use the right oil for your situation.
 Click here to read more about how spray oils differ in quality and how to choose the right one.
 BIOPEST's Quality Quality
 BIOPEST is a revolution in spray oil quality.
 Produced from a medicinal and food-grade iso-paraffinic oil BIOPEST's clarity is a clear sign of its quality and purity.
 The next time you open a drum of oil, check its clarity.
 Is it 'water clear'?
 The Trade-off Between Efficacy and Plant Safety Safety
 The general rule with mineral spray oils has been that heavier oils provide greater efficacy but carry an often unacceptable risk of plant damage, reduced fruit size and fruit spotting.
 That is, until now.
 BIOPEST is an optimal weight oil that breaks this rule.
 How?
 A Pure Oil .+ Optimal Weight .+ Quality Surfactant ..= Efficacy + Safety Safety
 USR 98+% nC24 Biodegradable Biodegradable
 Impurities cause damage the longer they stay on the plant surface.
 BIOPEST's USR rating of over 98% means it can stay on the plant surface and keep working without damaging the plant or restricting growth.
 BIOPEST persists on the leaf or fruit surface longer than lighter oils.
 This means:
 - More pests killed.
 - Significantly greater effectiveness in modifying the behaviour of pests.
 Improves the sticking and spreading properties of the oil in a rapidly biodegradable formula.
 More pest control per spray and for longer with less risk of plant, fruit or yield damage.
 SUMMER SUMMER
 Product Overview Overview
 SACOA SUMMER Insecticidal Spray Oil (SUMMER) is classified as a horticultural mineral oil (HMO).
 HMO�s are an integral component of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) (IPM)
 HMO�s are considered �soft� pesticides since they are generally specific to particular life stages of certain pests and also because they are not persistent in the environment.
 With increasing pressure to reduce the use of chemicals in the environment, spray oils are expected to become a greater influence on the market.
 The use of HMO�s as pesticides to control pests and diseases on many horticultural crops in IPM programs for sustainable long-term control is an area SACOA is committed to.
 Product Advantages Advantages
 Excellent emulsion stability under a range of water qualities and water rates.
 Assists insecticide penetration, effectively modifying the epicuticular wax (lipid) surface of the pest to facilitate the passage of the pesticide more efficiently.
 Reduces evaporation of spray solution before and after reaching the target surface.
 Reduces the surface tension of the spray droplet, there by aiding coverage.
 Produces a more uniform droplet reducing the very small and large droplets, alleviating the splash factor.
 Extensive field experiments conducted in Australia indicate that SUMMER significantly improves the performance of foliar applied pesticides.
 SUMMER may also be used to achieve similar benefits with certain other plant protection chemicals like miticides and fungicides.

 Do NOT apply an oil if temperatures are expected to exceed 32�C within 24 hours of application.
 Do NOT use on Glen Retreat variety of mandarins.
 Do NOT apply an oil if trees are water stressed.
 Do NOT apply Benlate� with SUMMER on Pome Fruit when temperatures exceed 28�C or after mid-November, or first cover spray.
 Bananas Bananas
 There are certain conditions when the surface of recently emerged fruit is particularly prone to marking damage from spray applications of mancozeb.
 In circumstances where application has been made to very rapidly growing fruit in hot conditions with strong direct sun light, it is recommended that all emerged bunches be bagged prior to spraying to minimise risk of fruit marking.
 Sulphur-based Compounds Compounds
 SUMMER is NOT compatible with wettable sulphur or compounds containing sulphur such as lime sulphur.
 STIFLE STIFLE
 SACOA�s STIFLE Dormant Spray Oil (STIFLE) is an emulsifiable, highly refined, agricultural spray formulated to control a variety of pests and diseases during the winter dormant period up until budburst / green tip stage.
 It is a highly effective controller for a variety of pests including mites, thrips, scales and other pests on stone and pome fruit trees, grape vines and nut tree�s such as almonds and pecans.
 STIFLE is formulated with an emulsifier which has been selected to provide effective retention on tree branches.
 At the same time, it allows a fast separation of the oil from the water when applied to the trees in a fine, even, atomised spray.
 This then penetrates into cracks and crevices where mites and scale lay during winter.
 It also ensures that a high proportion of the oil is retained on the tree.
 As a result, oil loss due to dripping is minimal.
 Recent Australian research has shown that correct timing of spray oils applications can greatly reduce future requirements for follow up insecticide and miticide sprays.
 In turn this reduces the possible contact that the applicator may have with highly toxic chemicals.
 Crop Safety Safety
 Mineral based spray oils are not compatible with sulphur-based products and should not be used within 4 weeks of a sulphur spray application as crop damage may occur.
 Spray Tank Cleanup Cleanup
 Always follow instructions on the herbicide label for decontamination of spray equipment.
 For STIFLE wash out with soapy water, or 1% solution of ammonia followed by several rinses of fresh water.
 Product Use Use
 STIFLE readily mixes with emulsifiable concentrates, dry flowable and wettable granule formulation pesticides.
 It doesn't contain any ingredients that may cause nozzle or spray equipment blockages, so equipment can be cleaned after use by simply rinsing with water (refer to the tank cleanup section on product label for complete details).
 When combination sprays are to be prepared, the normal concentration of the insecticide or fungicide should be mixed first as per the chemicals �Table for Use� and the oil added as the last ingredient.
 Mixing order for combination sprays:
 Half fill spray tank with water.
 Add water conditioner, if necessary.
 Under constant agitation, add pesticide or fungicide at label recommended rate.
 Continue to fill remainder of tank with water.
 Finally adding required amount of STIFLE while still agitating solution.
 Mixing order for oil-water sprays:
 Half fill spray tank with water.
 Add required amount of STIFLE to tank while constantly agitating.
 Continue to fill remainder of tank with water.
 Further points on correct product use:
 It is important always to add the oil to the water, never in the reverse order.
 Only clean spray tanks should be used.
 STIFLE is a pour in type product and doesn�t need to be pre-emulsified.
 Abstract Abstract
 Little is known about the environmental fate of adjuvants after application on the agricultural land.
 Adjuvants constitute a broad range of substances, of which solvents and surfactants are the major types.
 Nonionic surfactants such as alcohol ethoxylates (AEOs) and alkylamine ethoxylates (ANEOs) are typically examples of pesticide adjuvants.
 In view of their chemical structure this paper outlines present knowledge on occurrence, fate and effect on the aquatic and terrestrial environment of the two adjuvants:
 AEOs and ANEOs.
 Both AEOs and ANEOs are used as technical mixtures.
 This implies that they are not one single compound but a whole range of compounds present in different ratios.
 Structurally both groups of substances have a mutual core with side chains of varying lengths.
 Each of these compounds besides having the overall ability to distribute between different phases also possesses some single compound behaviour.
 This is reflected in the parameters describing the fate e.g.
 distribution coefficient, leaching, run-off, adsorption to soil, degradation and effects of these substances.
 The adsorption behaviour of ANEOs in contrast to AEOs is particularly variable and matrix dependent due to the ability of the compound to ionise at environmentally relevant pH.
 Probably because the compounds exceeds high soil adsorption and are easily degradable which is reflected in the low environmental concentrations generally found in monitoring studies.
 The compounds generally possess low potency to both terrestrial and aquatic organisms.
 The major environmental problem related to these compounds is the ability to enhance the mobility of other pollutants in the soil column.
 The Legal Position of Adjuvants Adjuvants
 A.
 What is an adjuvant?
 The Pesticide Safety Directorate (PSD) define an adjuvant as follows:- follows:-
 A substance other than water without significant pesticidal properties, which enhances or is intended to enhance the effectiveness of a pesticide, when it is added to that pesticide.
 All adjuvants sold in the UK have to be authorised by PSD.
 They scrutinise data such as effect on pesticide residues, mammalian and aquatic toxicology, environmental data etc.
 Provided the information is acceptable, the adjuvant is authorised and given a unique adjuvant (ADJ) number.
 B.
 Additives not defined by PSD as adjuvants or pesticides pesticides
 There are several classes of "additives" which are used together with pesticides which fall outside the PSD definitionof either a pesticide or an adjuvant.
 For these products there are no statutory restrictions from PSD as to their use, and they are not required to be authorised or approved by PSD e.g.:- e.g.:-
 C.
 Where can you use adjuvants?
 The area where one may use an adjuvant is defined under the following six headings:- headings:-
 1st Field of Use (defines the use areas):- areas):-
 e.g.
 FOR USE ONLY AS AN AGRICULTURAL/HORTICULTURAL/ FORESTRY WETTING AGENT AGENT
 2nd Specific authorised uses for the adjuvant adjuvant
 e.g.
 Edible and non-edible crops - all approved pesticides whose labels recommend the addition of a wetting agent or adjuvant oil.
 3rd With the full approved rate of the pesticide (Crop growth stage table) table)
 When the pesticide product and adjuvant are applied before a significant part of the consumable part of the crop has developed - see table:- table:-

 D.
 Overlap area (non-statutory conditions of use) use)
 There is an "overlap area" where an authorised adjuvant has properties and uses which are outside the scope of the PSD adjuvant legislation e.g:- e.g:-
 Product type type
 Example Example
 Water conditioners conditioners
 Li-700 Li-700
 Acidification Agents Agents
 Li-700 Li-700
 Improving trace element uptake uptake

 Anti-drift agent agent
 Improving trace element uptake uptake
 These uses are not subject to the PSD Statutory Conditions of Use for Li-700 and as such Li-700 can be used, irrespective of crop or growth stage, providing there is a good scientific reason for doing so.
 Inert Ingredient Frequently Asked Questions Questions
 1.
 What is an �inert ingredient�?
 An inert ingredient is any substance (or group of structurally similar substances if designated by the Agency), other than an �active� ingredient, which is intentionally included in a pesticide product.
 It is important to note, the term �inert� does not imply that the chemical is nontoxic.
 Inert ingredients play a key role in the effectiveness of a pesticidal product.
 For example, inert ingredients may serve as a solvent, allowing the pesticide's active ingredient to penetrate a plant's outer surface.
 In some instances, inert ingredients are added to extend the pesticide product's shelf-life or to protect the pesticide from degradation due to exposure to sunlight.
 Pesticide products may contain more than one inert ingredient; however, federal law does not require that these ingredients be identified by name or percentage on the label.
 In general, only the total percentage of inert ingredients is required to be on the pesticide product label, certain exceptions apply.
 All inert ingredients in pesticide products, including those in an inert mixture, must be approved for use by the EPA.
 For those inert ingredients applied to food, a tolerance or tolerance exemption is required.
 Impurities are not included in the definition of inert ingredient (see Question 17 for more information on impurities).
 2.
 Where can I find a list of approved inert ingredients?
 For the most current list of inert ingredients approved for food use pesticide products see the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (e-CFR) at http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/textidx?
 c=ecfr&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title40/40cfr180_main_02.tpl The majority of inert ingredients can be found in 40 CFR 180.910-180.960.
 40 CFR part 180 also contains a number of sections that include tolerances/ tolerance exemptions for specific inert ingredients where their use is usually significantly limited.
 An example is � 180.1065 which is a tolerance exemption for 2-Amino-4,5-dihydro-6-methyl-4-propyl-s-triazolo(1,5- alpha)pyrimidin-5-one when used as an emetic at not more than 0.3 percent in formulation of paraquat dichloride.
 The list of �Inert Ingredients Permitted for Use in Nonfood Use Pesticide Products� can be found at http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/inerts/inert_nonfooduse.pdf .
 This list is updated periodically.
 For information on the Pesticide Program�s Pilot Fragrance Notification Program and Fragrance Ingredient Database, please see the following sites:

 3.
 Why do I need to know the approval status of my inert ingredient before submitting a formulation to the Agency?
 All Confidential Statements of Formula (CSF) submitted with a new or amended pesticide registration application are screened to ensure that all inert ingredients are approved for the labeled use of pesticide formulation.
 If an inert ingredient is not currently eligible for the intended use of the pesticide formulation and does not fall under any of the PRIA fee categories in Question 18, then the submission may be rejected and a portion of the PRIA fee (if applicable) may be retained.
 (See Question 18 for information on PRIA fees related to inert ingredients) It is important to ensure that the labeled uses of the pesticide product do not fall outside the use limitation of the inert ingredients.
 Some inert ingredients are approved for nonfood use only (e.g.
 ornamental plants, lawns, use in swimming pools, etc.) while others may be given a tolerance or tolerance exemption for a limited food use application such as the example provided in Question 2.
 4.
 What is the difference between 40 CFR 180.910, 180.920, 180.930, 180.940, etc.?
 The Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requires that all inert ingredients used in pesticide products applied to food sites must have an applicable tolerance/tolerance exemption in the Code of Federal Regulations under 40 CFR 180.
 These tolerance/tolerance exemptions often contain limitations on how the inert ingredient can be used in food-use pesticide products.
 It is important to keep this in mind when selecting an inert ingredient for use in a pesticide formulation.
 Please note:
 In addition to the general limitations of the sections (e.g.
 180.920, 180.940, etc.) each tolerance exemption may have a chemical-specific limitation that affects its approval status.
 For example 3,6-Dimethly-4-octyn-3,6-diol is approved under � 180.920 for use on growing crops, however, it is limited to applications to �soil prior to planting or to plants before the edible parts form� when used as a surfactant or related adjuvants of surfactants.
 These limitations are listed in the CFR citation.
 40 CFR 180 organizes inert ingredients into sections by general limitation as follows:
 ?
 � 180.910 �Inert ingredients used pre- and post-harvest; exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance.� ?
 � 180.920 �Inert ingredients used pre-harvest; exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance.� ?
 � 180.930 �Inert ingredients applied to animals; exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance.� ?
 � 180.940 �Tolerance exemptions for active and inert ingredients for use in antimicrobial formulations (Food-contact surface sanitizing solutions).� ?
 � 180.950 �Tolerance exemptions for minimal risk active and inert ingredients.� ?
 � 180.960 �Polymers; exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance.� For a more detailed description of the categories, please see http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/textidx?
 c=ecfr&sid=8a4a95df289b02c534ebd6bbb353a119&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title40/40cfr180_m ain_02.tpl 5.
 How do I get approval for the use of a new inert ingredient?
 IIAB has created three comprehensive guidance documents for food use, nonfood use, and Low Risk Polymer submissions.
 Please see these guidance documents for a more in depth explanation of the inert approval process including tips and templates to assist you in Updated August 11, 2011 3 compiling your submission package.
 To obtain a copy of these packets please visit our website at http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/inerts or contact IIAB at InertsBranch@epa.gov.
 For instructions on how to get a trade name/mixture approved see Question 12.
 6.
 I want to add a use to an already approved chemical, do I need to submit a new new
 petition?
 All changes/amendments regarding food use pattern (e.g.
 having an exemption under 180.920 and wanting to include use patterns under 180.910 or wanting to expand a restricted use chemical) require a new petition.
 This petition must include a discussion on how the new proposed use pattern will affect the risk of adverse effects to human health and the environment.
 A new submission is also required to add a new nonfood use to an already approved nonfood inert ingredient.
 Please contact IIAB prior to your submission to discuss your request; IIAB will assist in determining what additional information, if any, would be necessary for a complete petition/submission.
 7.
 Are there instructions or templates for how to do a Notice of Filing (NOF)?
 NOF templates can be found at http://www.epa.gov/opptsfrs/home/rules1.html.
 Be sure to choose the NOF for the Registration Division.
 Instructions for filling out the NOF for food use inert ingredients and Low Risk Polymers can be found in the respective guidance documents for food use and polymer petitions discussed in Question 5.
 Nonfood submissions do not require a NOF.
 8.
 What data is required for a complete submission?
 Unlike active ingredients, inert ingredients do not have a �required� data set; however, the Agency must have sufficient data to make a safety determination regarding human health and the environment.
 For more information please see the Food Use, Nonfood Use, and Polymer Guidance Documents.
 We encourage you to contact us prior to submitting your petition to determine if additional information is necessary.
 We would be happy to speak to you over the phone or in person.
 To set up a meeting or to obtain a guidance document please contact us at InertsBranch@epa.gov.
 9.
 Do I need to submit a MSDS with my petition?
 Sources of information that may be submitted to the Agency include, but are not limited to, OPPTS guideline studies; publically available literature and data, including peer-reviewed assessments and journals (e.g.
 WHO, OECD SIDS, IUCLID, EPA HPV, IRSI, etc.); modeled data; and analog/surrogate data.
 A MSDS is only useful if the product contains 100% of the chemical in question and it clearly states this on the MSDS.
 In addition, in order for the toxicity data to be used by the Agency in the risk assessment process it must come from an acceptable accessible source and the source must be cited on the MSDS.
 10.
 How long does the review process take?
 Once a submission is placed on the work plan, the time frame for a new polymer, food use, or nonfood use inert ingredient submission is approximately 4-6 months, 8-12 months, and 6-8 months, respectively.
 This time frame can fluctuate based on the type of review needed, number of chemicals on the work plan ahead of yours, and branch workload.
 A submission is placed on the work plan once it is determined to be complete and adequate.
 Being placed on the work plan is simply a screening-level determination that all necessary supporting data and discussions have been received and are adequate to proceed with review, and any/all initial major deficiencies have been addressed.
 Once a more in depth review of the chemical is underway deficiencies may arise and additional information may be needed.
 Updated August 11, 2011 4 4
 11.
 Will I be notified when a decision is made on my submission?
 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requires that for all food use petitions (e.g.
 180.9 10-180.960), the Agency must publish a determination in the form of a Final Rule in the Federal Register.
 Only after a Final Rule granting the use of the inert ingredient is published in the Federal Register is the chemical legally allowed to be used in a pesticide formulation.
 Companies requesting the use of a nonfood inert ingredient will receive a letter regarding the the
 Agency�s safety determination and subsequent approval status of the chemical.
 Once a letter has been issued, granting the use of the inert ingredient, the chemical may be used in nonfood use pesticide formulations.
 Newly approved nonfood use chemicals will be added to the list of �Inert Ingredients Permitted for Use in Nonfood Use Pesticide Products� periodically.
 12.
 How do I get a trade name/mixture approved?
 The Agency evaluates trade name products based on the individual components of that product.
 Each component of the trade name/mixture must be approved for use as an inert ingredient.
 If all of the ingredients are approved for use then the trade name or mixture is permitted in pesticide products based on the component with the most restrictive use pattern.
 For example, suppose Mixture A is made up of chemical X, Y, and Z.
 If X and Y are approved for food use under 180.950 and Z is only approved for nonfood use, then Mixture A can only be used in nonfood products.
 In order to determine the status of a trade name product or inert mixture the following information will need to be submitted to the Inert Ingredient Assessment Branch by the manufacturer on company letter head:
 1.
 The full product name 2.
 The chemical name/s and CAS Reg.
 No.
 of each ingredient 3.
 The % (by wt) in formulation of each component* of the final trade name product (not the starting materials used to make the final product)- components must total 100%.
 4.
 If there are impurities remaining in the final product, those components should be listed as such along with their percentage in the final formulation (See Question 17 for more information on impurities).
 Compositional information should be submitted using the address in Question 24.
 *Please note- If the product contains a component that is itself a mixture or trade name product, EPA needs to receive the above information for all of the proprietary products.
 13.
 Is a MSDS acceptable to get a trade name product/inert mixture in Agency�s database?
 The Agency requires that all components in a trade name/mixture be clearly identified by chemical name and CAS Reg.
 No.
 and that the components must total 100%.
 If the manufacturer�s MSDS contains all of the information outlined in Question 12, the MSDS would be adequate.
 14.
 How do I find out if an inert mixture is already approved?
 To get the approval status of a trade name or inert mixture please contact IIAB at inertsbranch@epa.gov .
 We are unable to confirm any of the components of the trade name/mixture; the Agency considers this information to be Confidential Business Information.
 We will, however, provide the overall approval status of the trade name product.
 Updated August 11, 2011 5 5
 15.
 Which inert ingredients are approved for use in FIFRA 25(b) products?
 The following link lists the inert ingredients permitted in FIFRA 25(b) Pesticide Products http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/inerts/section25b_inerts.pdf.
 The Agency is currently in the process of developing new regulations related to the ingredients permitted for use in FIFRA 25(b) exempted products.
 Until these new regulations (which are expected to include a codified listing of permitted inert ingredients) are established, no substances will be added or removed from the "Inert Ingredients Eligible for FIFRA 25(b) Pesticide Products." Products."
 For more information on FIFRA 25(b) Pesticide Products please see http://www.epa.gov/oppbppd1/biopesticides/regtools/25b/25b-inerts.htm.
 If additional information is required please contact the Biopesticide and Pollution Prevention Division Ombudsman Brian Steinwand at steinwand.brian@epa.gov or (703)305-7973.
 16.
 How do I get my chemical added to the �4A� Minimal risk inert ingredients list?
 The List Category policy (i.e.
 the classification of inert ingredients as List 1, 2, 3, and 4A/4B), created in 1987, has now served its purpose as a tool for prioritizing the evaluation of inert ingredients.
 Now that reassessment of food tolerances/tolerance exemptions under the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) is complete, the approval determinations of inert ingredients are no longer classified as List 1, 2, 3, or 4A/4B and these lists are no longer being updated by the Office of Pesticide Programs.
 17.
 Do I need to list impurities on the trade name/mixture formulations?
 How are they evaluated?
 Is there a de minimis level for which reporting is not necessary?
 Impurities are not considered to be "pesticide chemicals" and are not subject to have a tolerance or tolerance exemption established under 40 CFR Part 180.
 Therefore, there is no formal petition process for impurities in inert ingredient formulations.
 However, all impurities in inert formulations need to be reported and are evaluated on a case by case basis.
 There is no "de minimis" level for impurities related to inert ingredients.
 The Agency looks at the amount in the formulation, the manufacturing information, and what steps are taken to limit or remove impurities.
 This information would be needed to make a determination regarding the need for further action.
 For more information on how to list impurities of a pesticide formulation on a CSF see http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/guidance/product-sop.htm#_1_20 http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/guidance/product-sop.htm#_1_20
 18.
 Is there a PRIA fee associated with inert ingredients?
 Requests for a new or amended inert ingredient tolerance exemption (excluding safeners) that are not linked to a pesticide product formulation do not incur a PRIA fee.
 If a new inert ingredient is part of an application for registration of a new conventional chemical product the PRIA code would be R311 for food use and R312 for nonfood use.
 If a new conventional pesticide product is submitted and it requires an amendment to an existing inert tolerance exemption (e.g.
 adding post-harvest use) it will fall under PRIA code R313.
 The only other PRIA fee category applicable to inert ingredients is B903, a request to approve a Plant Incorporated Protectant inert ingredient such as a marker protein.
 PRIA 2 fees can be found at http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/regulating/fees/tool/category-table.html http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/regulating/fees/tool/category-table.html
 19.
 What is a pesticide adjuvant and how is it regulated by EPA?
 While there are a number of definitions for pesticide adjuvant, it is generally broadly defined as any substance separately added to a pesticide product (typically as part of a spray tank mixture), that will improve the performance of the pesticide product.
 Since pesticide adjuvant products don�t make pesticidal claims, they are not pesticides and the components of adjuvants are therefore not pesticide inert ingredients.
 However, it should be noted that residues of pesticide adjuvants in or on food commodities are subject to the requirements of Updated August 11, 2011 6 the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which means that a food additive regulation or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is needed for any substance used as a pesticide adjuvant that is applied to food crops.
 20.
 Are data submitted on inert ingredients subject to data protection?
 Under Section 408(i) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), data submitted to support tolerances or tolerance exemptions (i.e., food use data) for inert ingredients are entitled to data compensation and exclusive use data rights �to the same extent as provided by�[Section 3 of] the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.
 Data protection rights for submitters of data for nonfood use inert ingredients are limited to certain cases for which data are submitted directly in response to test orders issued under FFDCA section 408(p) as part of the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP).
 21.
 If I am sending in a petition/submission for an inert ingredient and another company is submitting data on my behalf can they send it to the Agency prior to the submission of the petition?
 All data must be sent in at the same time the petition is submitted to the Agency.
 We are unable to accept data before the request for a new/amended inert ingredient is received by front-end processing and a petition number (if applicable) is assigned.
 Data submitted before a petition/submission may not be tracked properly and may cause a delay in the review processing time.
 22.
 Are aromatic solvents acceptable for use as inert ingredients in food use pesticide formulations?
 On June 22, 2011, an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance (i.e., a food use approval) was established for C9 rich aromatic hydrocarbons, C10�11 rich aromatic hydrocarbons, and C11�12 rich aromatic hydrocarbons (76 FR 36356).
  Such rights would be in the form of data compensation rights that require that registrants seeking a registration for a pesticide product containing an inert ingredient for which data protection rights are claimed, to, as appropriate, make an offer to pay for the use of data, or obtain authorization for the use of data prior to the Agency granting a registration.
 Alternatively, registrants or other interested parties may seek to establish other tolerance exemptions for aromatic solvents.
 The Agency practice of allowing certain aromatic solvents to be permitted to be used in food use pesticide formulations based on the extant exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance for xylene under 40 CFR 180.910, 40 CFR 180.920 and 40 CFR 180.930 has been discontinued�the tolerance exemption for xylene will apply only to xylene.
 23.
 Are fertilizers permitted in pesticide formulations applied to food?
 Fertilizers meeting the definition of a fertilizer as given by the Association of Plant Food Control Officials (AAPFCO), containing AAPFCO recognized plant nutrients, and used in Updated August 11, 2011 7 pesticide products solely for their plant nutrient value are acceptable for use in pesticide formulations applied food crops.
 Fertilizers not meeting the AAPFCO definition or containing other components not recognized by AAPFCO as acceptable fertilizer components would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by EPA.

 - Cooperation opportunities and market threat to overseas/foreign pesticide adjuvant producer, business opportunities to related industries or companies companies
 As the world� second largest pesticide supplier with total output exceeding 2,000,000 tonnes in 2009, China demands a considerable quantity of pesticide adjuvant totaling 400,000~500,000 tonnes, of which surfactant is about 65,000~70,000 tonnes.
 Although China�s pesticide A.I.
 output and consumption volume of ready-to-use formulations rank second in the world, there are many constraints in Chinese adjuvant industry, resulting in few domestic high-performance formulations and rare pesticide brands in overseas markets, especially in developed countries.
 Many reasons can contribute to the fact that development of China�s pesticide adjuvant industry falls behind that of the pesticides A.I.
 The first and foremost one is that local governments and domestic producers pay little attention to basic reach of adjuvant and hardly invest in this field, leading to low R&D level and small output of excellent adjuvant, thereby the relatively weak competitiveness of domestic pesticide formulations in global market.
 The development of adjuvant R&D is a prerequisite for an expected remarkable progress of China�s pesticide adjuvant industry, which is to achieve in the coming few years and will greatly impact global supply structure of ready-to-use pesticides.
 In this research, readers can:
 - Obtain general concept of Chinese pesticide adjuvant industry industry

 Policy Brief � agrochemicals:
 linking health and environmental management management
 Unintentional poisonings kill an estimated 355 000 people globally each year (1).
 In developing countries � where two thirds of these deaths occur � such poisonings are associated strongly with excessive exposure to, and inappropriate use of, toxic chemicals.
 In many such settings, toxic chemicals may be emitted directly into soil, air, and water � from industrial processes, pulp and paper plants, tanning operations, mining, and unsustainable forms of agriculture � at levels or rates well in excess of those tolerable to human health (2,3,4).
 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has estimated that by the year 2020, nearly one third of the world's chemical production will take place in non-OECD countries and that global output will be 85% higher than it was in 1995.
 The shift of chemical production to poor countries may increase related health and environmental risks (5).
 AGROCHEMICALS:
 HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT LINKAGES LINKAGES
 Good management, use, and disposal of agrochemicals � particularly pesticides � is an an important health and environment issue in developing countries � where economies may be heavily reliant on agriculture.
 The issue is a focus of this section on toxic hazards.
 In developing countries, deaths by unintentional poisoning may be strongly associated with inappropriate use and poor environmental management of toxic chemicals, including pesticides.

 Acute exposure to pesticides can lead to death or serious illness (6).
 Chronic pesticide exposure is most often a problem in the occupational setting, particularly among poor rural populations where men, women, and children all work and live in close proximity to fields and orchards where chemicals are applied and stored (4,7).
 Long-term exposure to pesticides can increase the risk of developmental and reproductive disorders, immune-system disruption, endocrine disruption, impaired nervous-system function, and development of certain cancers.
 Children are at higher risk from exposure than are adults (6,7,3,2).
 Pesticides, when not judiciously used, may disrupt natural biological pest control mechanisms.
 More vigorous pest attacks may result, along with heavier chemical use, and increased health exposures.
 Pesticides, as well as fertilizers, can infiltrate water sources � contaminating drinking water and animal species, e.g.
 fish, upon which humans rely for nutrition.
 Such contamination can lead to a range of secondary public health impacts (7,8).
 Taking action action
 IN THE FIELD:
 Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies can reduce the use of agrochemicals, improve management, and optimize ecosystem mechanisms for pest control/soil enrichment � simultaneously protecting both farmers and the environment.
 AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL:
 policies to improve regulation and control of pesticide sale, distribution, and use; health care systems to identify, treat, and monitor cases of pesticide poisonings; and educational/advocacy tools to inform the public as well as agriculture and health-care workers about health risks and best practice use of agrochemicals � all are important.
 AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL:
 implementation of global conventions on the management of highly toxic chemicals, including certain pesticides, from production to disposal stages is also critical.
 These include:
 the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants; the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals in International Trade, and the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and their Disposal (9).
 Pesticides industry is one of the major facilitator of the Agricultural sector.
 Pesticides are one of the important agricultural inputs required to protect crops from the ravages of pests and diseases.
 It is estimated that around 10-30% of the crop is damaged due to pests including insect pests, diseases, rodents and weeds at various stages of cultivation and distribution.
 In value term crop worth Rs 100,000 crore is destroyed due to inadequate and improper usage of pesticides.
 India's per hectare consumption of pesticides is one of the lowest in the world with consumption very much biased towards insecticides.
 Hence it is imperative that the government pays heed to the industry in addressing their problems.
 The pesticides industry has played a pivotal role in increasing the agricultural production by improving the productivity of Indian farmers.
 Use of pesticides not only reduces crop loss but also provides an indirect insurance cover to the farmer by protecting his investment in seeds, fertilizers, irrigation and labor from ravages of insects, pests and weeds.
 It is pertinent to note that there is no excise duty on seeds and fertilizers but pesticides attract 8% excise Duty.
 For the benefit of farmers and to improve their living standards, the industry wants rationalization in this front.
 The industry also faces volatile input prices thus impacting the margins significantly.
 The increased popularity of genetically modified seeds has been hitting hard the demand for pesticides.
 But oflate, even these GM crops require different range of pesticides, which comes as an opportunity for the domestic players.
 Also, as low cost producers of generics, India stands to gain by supplying ingredients and intermediates to the global players.

 According to the report, the world's six largest agrochemical manufacturers, who control nearly 75% of the global pesticide market, are also seed industry giants.
 It's worth breaking this down by company.
 Bayer:
 the world's biggest agrochemical company is also the world's seventh biggest seed company.
 Syngenta:
 the world's second largest agrochemical company is also the world's third largest seed company.
 Monsanto:
 the world's biggest seed company is the world's fifth largest agrochemical company.
 And DuPont:
 the world's second biggest seed company is also the world's sixth largest agrochemical company.
 All these companies are gene giants.
 Weed killers (herbicides) account for about one-third of the global pesticide market, and around 80% of GM seeds involve herbicide-resistance.
 The worldwide market for agrochemicals grew last year by nearly 10%.

 The top 10 companies control 89% of the global agrochemical market.
 The worldwide market for agrochemicals was US$38.6 billion in 2007 - up 8.4% over the previous year.
 The top 6 companies accounted for $28.8 billion, or 75% of the total market.
 Symbiotic Sales:
 The world's six largest agrochemical manufacturers are also seed industry giants.
 Despite sky-rocketing fuel and fertilizer costs, high grain prices created soaring demand for commercial seeds and pesticides in 2007.
 After two decades of sagging sales, the world's largest pesticide companies rebounded last year - in large part due to the subsidy-driven boom in agrofuel crops.
 In 2007 the four largest pesticide companies (Bayer, Syngenta, BASF, Dow) reported double-digit sales jumps.
 Pesticide revenues are up in nearly all regions [particularly South America].
 Mind the Gap:
 Weed killers account for about one-third of the global pesticide market, and agrochemical giants are ratcheting up R&D on new herbicides and herbicide-tolerant genes.
 Monsanto's glyphosate-resistant (Roundup Ready) crops have reigned supreme on the biotech scene for over a decade - creating a near-monopoly for the company's Roundup Ready herbicide - which is now off patent.
 According to Chemical & Engineering News, BASF, Syngenta, Bayer, Dow and DuPont are competing to fill "the glyphosate gap" - a gap that's growing fast because at least 14 weed species on five continents have developed resistance due to massive applications of glyphosate.
 As a result, farmers must employ more toxic chemicals to kill the resistant weeds.
 Commonly known as the "pesticide treadmill," it's a classic case of chasing a new techno-fix to mop up the mess of an older, failed technology.
 Agrochemical giants prefer to describe the resistance problem as a business opportunity:
 In the words of Syngenta's Crop Science CEO, John Atkin:
 "Resistance is actually quite healthy for our market, because we have to innovate." innovate."

 Background Background
 Recent declines in honey bees for crop pollination threaten fruit, nut, vegetable and seed production in the United States.
 A broad survey of pesticide residues was conducted on samples from migratory and other beekeepers across 23 states, one Canadian province and several agricultural cropping systems during the 2007�08 growing seasons.
 Methodology/Principal Findings Findings
 We have used LC/MS-MS and GC/MS to analyze bees and hive matrices for pesticide residues utilizing a modified QuEChERS method.
 We have found 121 different pesticides and metabolites within 887 wax, pollen, bee and associated hive samples.
 Almost 60% of the 259 wax and 350 pollen samples contained at least one systemic pesticide, and over 47% had both in-hive acaricides fluvalinate and coumaphos, and chlorothalonil, a widely-used fungicide.
 In bee pollen were found chlorothalonil at levels up to 99 ppm and the insecticides aldicarb, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid, fungicides boscalid, captan and myclobutanil, and herbicide pendimethalin at 1 ppm levels.
 Almost all comb and foundation wax samples (98%) were contaminated with up to 204 and 94 ppm, respectively, of fluvalinate and coumaphos, and lower amounts of amitraz degradates and chlorothalonil, with an average of 6 pesticide detections per sample and a high of 39.
 There were fewer pesticides found in adults and brood except for those linked with bee kills by permethrin (20 ppm) and fipronil (3.1 ppm).
 Conclusions/Significance Conclusions/Significance
 The 98 pesticides and metabolites detected in mixtures up to 214 ppm in bee pollen alone represents a remarkably high level for toxicants in the brood and adult food of this primary pollinator.
 This represents over half of the maximum individual pesticide incidences ever reported for apiaries.
 While exposure to many of these neurotoxicants elicits acute and sublethal reductions in honey bee fitness, the effects of these materials in combinations and their direct association with CCD or declining bee health remains to be determined.

 Agrochemical Field Studies Studies
 Stone is at the forefront of developments in the pesticide environmental fate arena.
 Site-specific investigations demand expertise in experiment design, experience with the latest instrumentation, and well-trained and dedicated staff committed to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards.
 As one of the largest companies performing field studies for pesticide registrants, we have the capacity and staff to mobilize quickly to a field site.
 We are expert in finding the right sites to meet your study objectives, and in characterizing, instrumenting, and monitoring those sites.
 We offer our clients superior reporting services that detail study methods and carefully organize and present study data in reports tailored to client specifications.
 One of Stone�s greatest strengths is implementing large-scale monitoring studies of surface water and groundwater resources for both public and private drinking water supplies.
 Over the years, we have developed (and continually update) efficient project management systems, collected environmental data sets, and formed a network of field and research contacts that enable us to effectively coordinate these efforts.
 Our staff receives ongoing training in project management, including protocols, work plans, communications, organization, new technologies, GLP, and financial tracking.
 Large-scale studies we have performed include community drinking water monitoring programs involving as many as 200 community water systems, nationwide retrospective studies of potable water wells and monitoring wells, and multi-state field runoff studies.
 We are flexible in our approach.
 Stone assists with any phase of a study, from collecting samples when a client is shorthanded, to conducting all the fieldwork according to a protocol established by the client, to fully designing and implementing the study in consultation with the client.
 At Stone, the focus is on meeting clients� needs.
 There are unique aspects to every study, but most field studies fall into one of seven categories:
 � Edge-of-Field Runoff Runoff
 � Simulated Rainfall Runoff Runoff
 � Community Drinking Water Monitoring Monitoring
 � Surface Water Monitoring Monitoring
 � Prospective Groundwater Studies Studies
 � Retrospective Groundwater Monitoring Monitoring
 � Aquatic Fate Fate
 Edge-of-Field Runoff Studies Studies
 Stone has conducted nine studies quantifying runoff losses of crop protection and lawn care chemicals following rainstorms and irrigation.
 The objective of these studies was to assess the runoff potential of pesticide products under actual use conditions.
 In our most recent study, we qualified and instrumented 20 sites throughout the Midwest, trained contractors and growers to collect samples, and managed all sampling activities for the duration of the growing season.
 We set up more than 100 siphon-type runoff collectors at the sites, and instrumented five sites with Sigma autosamplers and tipping bucket rain gauges.
 In selecting sites for a runoff study, we identify regions with high product sales.
 We meet with farmers in these regions and characterize potential sites by determining catchment area, treatment area, soils, field slope, cropping practices, and other factors that influence runoff generation and chemical transport.
 We establish sampling points proximal to existing channels and culverts that collect and convey runoff.
 Our sampling methods range from inexpensive, low-tech approaches involving grab sampling, siphon-type runoff samplers, and nonrecording rain gauges to higher-tech installation of weather stations, flumes, stage recorders, and autosamplers.
 Stone assists clients in designing experiments to result in a cost-effective and technically sound study.

 Simulated Rainfall Runoff Studies Studies
 Relying on natural rain can be problematic and expensive for those conducting a runoff study.
 Everyone in the industry knows of a runoff study in which no runoff was generated, or, conversely, in which a massive event wiped out sampling equipment, ruining the experiment.
 Getting a natural runoff event of appropriate magnitude within a specific time period following product application is a matter of luck.
 Use of a rainfall simulator eliminates the risks associated with fickle weather, providing control over the timing, intensity, and duration of rain.
 From a logistical standpoint, using simulated rainfall guarantees that the test site is well staffed and that sampling equipment is ready when an event occurs.
 Because the timing is prescribed, site conditions may be fully characterized at the critical time immediately prior to the runoff event.
 Specific site conditions may also be achieved by irrigating the site to increase soil moisture or by mowing or using other crop management practices.
 Perhaps the most compelling reason for using simulated rainfall is that by standardizing rainfall intensity and duration, we vastly improve our ability to compare results among multiple experimental treatments and test sites.
 Stone began offering simulated rainfall runoff studies when it acquired the rainfall simulator technology developed by PTRL East.
 We have since conducted five small-scale runoff trials using simulated rainfall.
 We�ve examined and compared multiple experimental treatments, and tested different product formulations, product application methods, and runoff mitigation measures.
 We have the equipment and experienced staff ready to perform a runoff experiment at your direction.

 Community Drinking Water Monitoring Monitoring
 With 13 drinking water monitoring studies successfully implemented and 11 completed, we have led the industry in conducting such studies since 1994.
 These studies have involved several hundred community water systems (CWSs) across the US.
 We have worked with the Acetochlor Registration Partnership on the largest such study yet conducted, which involved almost 200 CWSs and spanned a period of seven years.
 Our smallest study involved just five systems sampled over the course of a year to address a product registration issue in a specific region.
 Over the last 10 years, we have developed and refined efficient procedures to select and characterize vulnerable CWSs, train sampling personnel, and manage sampling at participating CWSs.
 Integral to the system selection process is the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) to locate the CWSs in each state, to delineate watersheds for the source waters used by these systems, and to characterize land use, product use, runoff potential, and other spatial factors that contribute to vulnerability.
 Stone has created custom tools for use with ArcGIS that that efficiently query, map, and summarize crop data, soils data, land use, and historical precipitation records.
 The objective is to winnow, through an orderly and defensible process, the approximately 10,000 community water systems relying on surface water sources in the US to a representative number of potentially vulnerable systems.
 Since surface drinking water monitoring studies rely heavily on the cooperation of the employees of the CWSs, we place a great deal of emphasis on engaging CWS personnel and supporting them with supplies and logistical help throughout the study period.
 We make sure these employees are well trained in the sampling procedures and relevant aspects of GLPs.
 We provide a toll-free number so they can call Stone for assistance at any time and speak with a project scientist.
 We prepare field notebooks customized for each CWS containing sampling/chain-of-custody forms, bottle labels, prepaid shipping airbills, and sampling instructions.
 We use FedEx tracking software customized by us to ensure that samples are taken on time and delivered directly to the lab.
 If there is a problem anywhere in the system, we identify it quickly and make arrangements to correct it.
 We recently completed a study in which more than 2,400 samples were collected and shipped to an independent laboratory over a three-year period.

 Surface Water Monitoring Monitoring
 Between the edge of a farm field and a downstream water treatment plant is a network of drainage ditches and streams.
 We monitor the water and biota in these perennial streams to assess the potential impact of pesticides on aquatic animals and plants.
 We conduct stream sampling at this intermediate scale, where environmental concentrations of a pesticide need to be measured for comparison with ecotoxicological levels of concern.
 Stone conducts probabilistic assessments to identify stream reaches where pesticide concentrations are predicted to exceed regulatory levels of concern.
 We use several models (SWAT, WARP, PRZM/EXAMS) in combination with GIS to target certain reaches for monitoring on the basis of product use, crop, meteorological, soils, and other data.
 We instrument sampling stations with autosamplers and flow monitoring equipment, or rely on a schedule of grab sampling, with flow data derived from public sources.
 No standard exists in the pesticide fate field for surface water monitoring studies; therefore, Stone is particularly interested in working creatively with registrants to formulate solid experiment designs.
 Return to top of page page
 Prospective Groundwater Studies Studies
 Stone has implemented 17 prospective groundwater (PGW) studies in 10 states, representing all the major agricultural regions of the country.
 PGW studies are typically multi-year, intensive field trials; therefore, registrants need a contractor with staying power and experience�two hallmarks of Stone.
 We also have strengths in hydrogeology and project management, which we apply to these studies.
 All of our studies submitted to date have been accepted by EPA.
 Many of the PGW studies Stone has performed are on sites considered realistic worst-case settings:
 Selected sites typically have coarse-textured soils and shallow groundwater.
 However, several of our more recent PGW studies are on sites of intermediate vulnerability.
 These sites were selected through extensive vulnerability analyses we performed using GIS and PRZM modeling to identify areas that met specific vulnerability criteria.
 This probabilistic approach allows us to rank the relative vulnerability of field areas across a region, basing the rankings on the properties of the pesticide and field soils.
 This greatly improves our ability to interpret and extrapolate from study data.
 We characterize in the field the sites indicated by the vulnerability analysis to confirm the accuracy of the data used in the ranking.
 Stone maintains a readiness to initiate PGW studies.
 We are familiar with the latest instrumentation and constantly refine our sampling procedures for improved efficiency while maintaining the highest sample integrity.

 Retrospective Groundwater Monitoring Monitoring
 Stone excels in running successful retrospective groundwater monitoring (RGW) studies, having implemented six studies in 16 states, and sampled approximately 800 wells.
 We selected existing potable wells in four of these studies and installed monitoring wells in two.
 We are proficient in every aspect of these studies, from protocol development to reporting and well decommissioning (if necessary).
 We work closely with client sales representatives, local pesticide applicators, chemical distributors, and crop consultants to implement studies that are technically rigorous while maintaining sensitivity to the local agricultural community.
 For our largest study, we identified, characterized, and monitored more than 500 potable wells in five regions.
 The wells were hydraulically down-gradient of treated fields in areas with vulnerable groundwater conditions.
 In the spring of 2004, we performed a similar tap water study, selecting 150 potable wells in five regions in the space of a month.
 When an investigation demands the use of monitoring wells, we work with federal, state, and local governments to identify existing monitoring wells where possible.
 If monitoring well installation is warranted, we either contract with local drillers or install them ourselves.
 In one study, we installed 92 monitoring wells in six states.
 Stone worked closely with lead state agencies to ensure that the protocol and well locations were acceptable to the specific requirements of each state.
 We sampled the wells quarterly for three years using dedicated pumps, and finally decommissioned them per state standards.
 Stone has the resources to conduct an RGW of any scope in any region of the United States or Canada.

 Aquatic Fate Studies Studies
 Stone has experience consulting on aquatics projects, including technical evaluation, modeling, and aquatic dissipation.
 Stone�s entry into the aquatics field is a natural complement to its work with agricultural pesticides.
 In a study in Florida, we worked with local contractors and a nationally recognized aquatics expert to evaluate the dissipation of a partial pond application of an aquatic herbicide.
 Our good field science, project management, and reporting ensure the success of aquatic dissipation and aquatic dispersion trials.
 With our experience in aquatics and our alliances with top researchers in the field, we perform innovative, technically superior studies that fully meet the needs of pesticide registrants.
 Return to top of page page
 Spatial Analysis Analysis
 The use of geographic and temporal information to understand environmental conditions is integral to many of our studies.
 Working with Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, we compile, store, and display enormous amounts of data and perform spatial analyses to guide study design, support product use, and inform all stakeholders.
 The inclusion of spatial and temporal variables in assessments ultimately saves time and money.
 When higher-tiered assessments of environmental vulnerability are required, we couple spatial analysis with widely accepted modeling methods to attain a clear, scientifically defensible understanding of the complex landscape.
 Our Applied Information Management (AIM) group consists of a core group of scientists who specialize in spatial analysis, data management, and programming to evaluate agrochemical fate and transport.
 In addition to agrochemical fate and exposure work, the AIM group supports two other water quality groups at Stone.
 This diverse experience base strengthens the group�s analytical abilities and promotes a more comprehensive approach to achieving optimal results for our clients.
 We create our own data sets in addition to those we collect and organize from government and academic institutions, building customized interfaces to ease extraction and manipulation of information imperative to environmental assessments.
 For clients who demand customized analyses for specific applications, we develop GIS tools that automate repetitive processes�such as summarizing crop, land use, soils, and climate characteristics of watersheds or counties�to increase efficiency and save money.
 We have extensive experience working with a full spectrum of environmental databases:
 � Land cover (NLCD) (NLCD)
 � Cropping (NASS and Ag Census) Census)
 � Soils (SSURGO, STATSGO) STATSGO)
 � Topography (NED) (NED)
 � Hydrography (NHD) (NHD)
 � Climate (NCDC, PRISM) PRISM)
 These databases provide the foundation for many of our spatial assessments.
 Recognizing the need to provide environmental data to large numbers of users, we build Web-based databases and GIS applications, empowering a virtually unlimited number of users with environmental information customized for their application.

 Environmental Fate Modeling Modeling
 Since 1992, Stone has been assisting agrochemical clients with the registration of new chemicals, and the maintenance and mitigation of existing registrations.
 As a critical part of every registration project, our modeling team is one of the most experienced in the industry in predicting the environmental concentrations of an agrochemical in surface water and groundwater.
 Our modelers specialize in PRZM, GLEAMS, LEACHP, EXAMS, SWAT, PELMO, PEARL, TOXSWA, and WARP to perform:
 � Drinking water exposure estimates for toxicology risk assessments using surface water and groundwater models models
 � Aquatic agrochemical exposure estimates for ecotoxicology risk assessments using surface water models models
 � Calibration and investigative modeling for point and nonpoint source environmental fate phenomena phenomena
 � Probabilistic risk assessments combining spatial analysis with modeling to look at chemical behavior with spatial and temporal variability variability
 � Watershed-scale water-quality modeling modeling
 � Statistical methodology for study design, and interpretations of data and environmental fate summaries summaries
 Our team has completed hundreds of modeling studies to meet the regulatory requirements of the United States (federal and state governments), Canada, and the European Union.

 EU Registration Support Support
 Companies seeking registrations of their products in EU member states can benefit from the expertise of Stone Environmental.
 We specialize in fate and exposure risk assessments to satisfy the requirements of directive 91/414/EEC for the registration of new active ingredients and the re-registration of existing actives and products at the EU and national levels.
 With more than 10 years of experience, each lead scientist at Stone has extensive knowledge of the underlying models approved for use by the FOCUS effort.
 Stone�s submission-ready reports for the exposure risk assessment requirements contain the necessary predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) for surface water (PECSW) at Step 1 through Step 3, and for groundwater (PECGW).
 With its expertise in interpreting environmental fate laboratory and field studies and an in-house GIS capability, Stone is also the logical choice for conducting the higher-tier Step 4 assessments, should the consideration of mitigation measures, and a more detailed review of the fate package, be required to gain a successful registration.
 Certain EU member states have unique requirements for models that are specific to their needs (such as PELEP in Belgium), or have country-specific scenarios that were not adopted as standard EU-wide FOCUS scenarios.
 Stone stays informed as the criteria for national registrations evolve, and provides country-specific PEC calculations and reports as needed.

 Crop Protection Agrochemicals, Biopesticides and Biotechnology Product Development and Commercialization Consultants Consultants
 Today's crop protection and biotechnology companies know that bringing products to market requires knowledge, experience and speed.
 The most successful results occur when target markets and sales goals are accurately defined at the earliest stages and integrated into a comprehensive development and commercialization plan.
 This is true for both traditional agrochemical plant protection products and biopesticides that are targeted for the conventional and organic pest control markets.
 Ewing & Associates achieves this with the creativity and resourcefulness required by all clients, from well established agrochemical multinationals to fast-growth biotechnology and biopesticide startups.
 We bring together combined knowledge from a worldwide network of associates to develop the right strategy for our clients, one that reduces costs and time to market by avoiding mistakes.
 We help you achieve the ultimate goal - product sales.
 Ewing & Associates helps biopesticide, biotechnology and agrochemicals crop protection companies in the following areas:
 Product Development - We define product development for crop protection as pesticide registration (EPA and CDPR), pesticide formulation and field and laboratory studies required for registration.
 This includes designing and implementing agricultural research programs and obtaining OMRI certification for organic pesticides.
 Market Development - It is important to get new agriculture technology into the hands of the public (universities, distributors, growers, etc.) as early as possible in order to build confidence in the product and learn how to use it.
 This often overlaps with Product Development and Product Sales and should be integrated into the overall plan.
 Product Sales and Technical Support - Ewing & Associates now offers a product sales and technical support team that can establish and grow sales during a two or three year transition period between pesticide registration and market adoption of the crop protection product.
 This is especially important for biopesticides and biotechnology products.
 Why Do Biopesticides Present More Challenges to Commercialize Than Synthetic Chemicals?
 Ewing & Associates has a long history of working with traditional agrochemicals which have set the standard for "normal" agricultural practices.
 We use this knowledge and expertise to effectively guide biopesticides towards market adoption, a more difficult task.
 Why?
 Biopesticides generally add another variable to crop protection strategies.
 In addition to the life cycles of the crop and pest, another biological component is added to control a problem and conditions must be optimized to favor the biopesticide.
 Biopesticide companies commonly wait until after pesticide registration is obtained before introducing their crop protection product to the market.
 This delays product sales.
 Biopesticides require more technical support during the market introduction and market adoption phases.
 Why Is Ewing & Associates Uniquely Qualified To Assist Biopesticide and Biotechnology Companies Attain Their Goals?
 We have global experience of bringing crop protection products to market.
 We have established business relationships with regulatory, agricultural research and distribution partners throughout the world.
 We focus on high value horticultural markets such as vegetables; deciduous fruits, nut and vines; and, turf and ornamentals.
 If you have no presence in the USA, we can serve as your US Resident Agent, representing your business interests while operating within the technical and commercial arena.
 Ewing & Associates is a recipient of the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award.

 The term crop plays a very significant role in each and every person�s life.
 We can give all the credit of our survival to the crops that we consume.
 Imagine this earth without crops.
 But this imagination is quickly developing into a reality.
 It would not be long, when there would not be a single crop available on the earth.
 To avoid such a possibility scientist are performing various researches in order to increase the productivity of the crop.
 In modern times, the term �crop protection� has been a great issue of debate among scientists.
 Various methods are being invented each and every day to protect the crops from various hazards.
 Some of the common crop protection steps are listed below.
 Use of Pesticides Pesticides
 Various pesticides are being regularly introduced in the agricultural sector.
 Only use of pesticides does not guarantee 100 percent protection of crop.
 For complete protection one should used the best quality pesticides.
 There are many chemicals, which protect the crops but at the same time decrease the productivity of the soil as well as the quality of the crop.
 Such kind of pesticides should be averted from being used.
 The best pesticides are those, which are manufactured from natural renewable ingredients and thus are not harmful for crops.
 However the modern pesticides introduced are safe and one can reluctantly use them.
 There are various types of pesticides found which include bio-degradable pesticides, man- made pesticides, organic pesticides and many more.
 All these pesticides protect the crop from various insects and animals, thus helping in the increasing of the crop productivity.
 Use of Floating Covers Covers
 These covers are manufactured from porous fabric, which enables the sunlight, air and water to penetrate within.
 They are used to cover the crop, so as to protect them from frost and various other harmful insects.
 The outcome is that it increases the productivity and the quality of the crop.
 There are various other steps for crop protection like over crop, uses of superlative chemicals etc.

 Abstract Abstract
 The potential of emamectin benzoate (EB) to cause developmental neurotoxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats was assessed using a study design by the US EPA.
 Dosages of 0 (deionized water), 0.1, 0.6, or 3.6 mg/kg/day were administered at 5 ml/kg by oral gavage from gestational day (GD) 6 to lactational day (LD) 20 to groups of 25 mated females each.
 Between GD 17 and 20 the high dose was reduced to 2.5 mg/kg/day because of pup tremors observed at this dose level in a concurrent two-generation study.
 Females were allowed to deliver and the young were evaluated for survival, growth, development, behavior, and histological changes to brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and skeletal muscle.
 Behavioral assessment of the offspring consisted of open field motor activity, auditory startle habituation, and passive avoidance tests; each was conducted on weanling and adult animals (one animal/sex/litter).
 Histopathological examination of the CNS and PNS was conducted on one animal/sex/litter on postnatal days (PND) 11 and 60.
 There were significant increases in average F0 maternal body weight gains during gestation in the 0.6 and 3.6/2.5 mg/kg/day groups, but no other effects were observed in pregnant females of these or the low-dose groups during the study.
 Beginning on PND 6, tremors were observed in high-dose pups, and this was followed by hindlimb splay in all high-dose pups by PND 15-26.
 Both of these physical signs disappeared by PND 34 (i.e., 10-11 days after weaning).
 There were no compound-related deaths in F1 offspring.
 Beginning on PND 11, progressive decreases in preweaning average weights were observed in the high-dose group (to 42% below control in females on PND 21).
 Average weight gain during the postweaning period was significantly decreased in the 3.6/2.5 mg/kg/day group.
 There were EB-related effects in behavioral tests only in the high-dose group.
 A significant increase in PND 13 average horizontal motor activity was due to stereotypical movements.
 Average horizontal activity was decreased on PND 17 and in adult females, but there was no effects on PND 21.
 Average peak auditory startle response amplitude was decreased on PND 22 and in adults.
 There were no EB-related effects in the passive avoidance test, relative brain weights, or in the histological examination (including morphometry) of the nervous system.
 These results demonstrate that the high-dose EB exposure during gestation and lactation to rats produced evidence of neurotoxicity in the F1 offspring, and a clear No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for developmental neurotoxicity of EB was determined to be 0.6 mg/kg/day.

 As noted in a prior post, OEHHA is considering listing the pesticide Avermectin B1 under Proposition 65; Avermectin B1 (aka abamectin) is used to control insect and mite pests on a variety of fruit, vegetable, and ornamental crops.
 The manufacturer and several grower organizations are vigorously opposing the listing.
 The opposition makes two arguments.
 First, the listing would have a highly detrimental impact on the pesticides users; such an argument is unlikely to carry any weight whatsoever with OEHHA.
 Second, the method chosen by OEHHA for the listing is inconsistent with its regulations.
 In 1999, OEHHA first proposed to list the pesticide as a reproductive toxicant, but questions were raised by EPA about the CF-1 strain of mice used in the laboratory analyses of the pesticide.
 As such, OEHHA stopped the listing process while it further reviewed other data.
 In the latest Notice-of-Intent, OEHHA has relied on data other than the CF-1 mice experiments, and also specifically referred to EPA's 2005 document establishing tolerances for Avermectin B1.
 The use of the EPA tolerance document has been challenged by opponents of the listing as not the type of authoritative body listing permitted under the regulations.
 The California Farm Bureau also notes that Avermectin B1 is the "foundation" of many integrated pest management programs used in California because it is not detrimental to beneficial insects that prey on harmful insects, and as such any restraint on its use would result in an increase in the use of pesticides in California.
 Information on the proposed listing process for Avermectin B1, as well as links to other relevant information, can be found at http://www.oehha.ca.gov/prop65/CRNR_notices/admin_listing/intent_to_list/avermecNOIL062708.html.
 The dispute over the utility of Avermectin B1 highlights once again the often conflicting public policy goals between Proposition 65 and other medical and environmental programs.
 In this case there is a very real question about the adverse effect of the listing on IPM programs.
 By way of another example, OEHHA has actually listed medicines, a tradeoff that is left much better to the patient-physician relationship, not to some mandatory labeling program.
 TRADE OR OTHER NAMES NAMES
 Also known as Avermectin B1 and MK-936.
 Trade names include Affirm, Agri-Mek, Avid, Dynamec, Vertimec and Zephyr.
 INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION
 Abamectin is a mixture of avermectins containing > 80% avermectin B1a and < 20% avermectin B1b (1).
 These two components, B1a and B1b have very similar biological and toxicological properties (5).
 The avermectins are insecticidal or anthelmintic compounds derived from the soil bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis (2).
 Abamectin is a natural fermentation product of this bacterium (5).
 Abamectin is used to control insect and mite pests of a range of agronomic, fruit, vegetable and ornamental crops, and it is used by homeowners for control of fire ants (5).
 Doses of 50 to 200 ug/kg of ivermectin, a similar member of the avermectin family of comounds, is widely used to treat humans in the World Health Organization onchocerciasis (river blindness) program (2, 8).
 TOXICOLOGICAL EFFECTS EFFECTS
 ACUTE TOXICITY TOXICITY
 Abamectin is a highly toxic material, however most formulated products containing abamectin are of low toxicity to mammals (5, 7).
 Emulsifiable concentrate formulations may cause moderate eye irritation and mild skin irritation (1).
 Symptoms of poisoning observed in laboratory animals include pupil dilation, vomiting, convulsions and/or tremors, and coma (5).
 Abamectin acts on insects by interfering with neural and neuromuscular transmission.
 It acts on a specific type of synapse located only within the brain and is protected by the blood-brain barrier.
 However, at very high doses, the mammalian blood-brain barrier can be penetrated, causing symptoms of CNS depression such as incoordination, tremors, lethargy, excitation and pupil dilation.
 Very high doses have caused death from respiratory failure (2).
 Abamectin is not readily absorbed through skin.
 Tests with monkeys show that less than 1% of dermally applied abamectin was absorbed into the bloodstream through the skin (5).
 Abamectin does not cause allergic skin reactions (7).
 The amount of a chemical that is lethal to one-half (50%) of experimental animals fed the material is referred to as its acute oral lethal dose fifty, or LD50.
 The oral LD50 for abamectin in rats is 11 mg/kg, and in mice range from 14 (5) to > 80 mg/kg (7).
 The dermal LD50 for technical abamectin on rats and rabbits is > 330 mg/kg (4).
 The oral LD50 for the product Affirm 0.011% Fire Ant Bait in rats is > 5,000 mg/kg, and its dermal LD50 on rabbits is > 2,000 mg/kg (1).
 The oral LD50 for the 1.8% w/v Abamectin EC product in rats is 300 mg/kg, and the dermal LD50 for this product on rabbits is > 2,000 mg/kg (8).
 CHRONIC TOXICITY TOXICITY
 In a 1-year study with dogs given oral doses of 0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg/day, there were no changes in tissue at any dose level.
 However, some dogs at the 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day levels had pupillary dilation, weight loss, lethargy, tremors and recumbency.
 The NOEL for this study was 0.25 mg/kg/day (5, 8).
 Similar results were seen in a 2-year study with rats fed 0, 0.75, 1.5, or 2 mg/kg/day.
 No changes in the nervous or muscular systems were observed, but rats in all the dosage levels exhibited body weight gains significantly higher than the controls.
 A few individuals in the high dose group exhibited tremors (5).
 When mice were fed 8 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, for 94 weeks, the males developed dermatitis and changes in blood formation in the spleen, while females exhibited tremors and weight loss (7).
 Reproductive Effects Effects
 In rats, the pup toxicity NOEL was 0.12 mg/kg/day.
 At 0.40 mg/kg/day, there were increased stillbirths, decreased pup viability, decreased lactation, and decreased pup weights (7).
 Teratogenic Effects Effects
 Abamectin has produced cleft palate in the offspring of treated mice and rabbits, but only at doses that were also toxic to the mothers (5).
 There were no birth defects in the offspring of rats given up to 1 mg/kg/day (7).
 Mutagenic Effects Effects
 Abamectin is not mutagenic.
 The microbial mutagenesis and mutagenicity tests in live mice were negative.
 One test on rat liver cell cultures was positive (7).
 Carcinogenic Effects Effects
 Abamectin was not carcinogenic in rats or mice fed the maximum tolerated doses.
 The rats were fed dietary doses of 0.75, 1.5, or 2 mg/kg/day for 24 months, and the mice were fed 2, 4 or 8 mg/kg/day for 22 months (5).
 Fate in Humans and Animals Animals
 Tests with laboratory animals show that ingested avermectin B1a is absorbed into the bloodstream by mammals and that it is rapidly eliminated from the body within 2 days via the feces (7, 8).
 Rats given single oral doses of radio-labeled avermectin B1a excreted most of the dose (69 to 82%) unchanged in the feces.
 The half-life of avermectin B1a residues in rat tissues averaged 1.2 days (4).
 Similarly, when monkeys were given a single intravenous injection of avermectin B1a, more than 90% of the dose was excreted in the feces within 7 days of the dosing (5, 8).
 Lactating goats given daily oral doses for 10 days excreted 89% of the administered avermectin, mainly in the feces.
 Less than 1% was recovered in the urine (4).
 ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS EFFECTS
 Effects on Birds Birds
 Abamectin is relatively non-toxic to birds (7).
 The LD50 for abamectin in Bobwhite quail is 2,000 mg/kg.
 When exposed to abamectin in their feed for 5 days, the LC50 for bobwhite quail was 3,102 ppm, and for mallard ducks was 383 ppm.
 There were no adverse effects on reproduction when mallard ducks were fed dietary doses of 3, 6 or 12 ppm for 18 weeks (6).
 Effects on Aquatic Organisms Organisms
 Abamectin is highly toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates (7).
 Its 96-hour LC50 in rainbow trout is 3.2 ppb, 9.6 ppb in bluegill sunfish, 15 ppb in sheepshead minnow, 24 ppb in channel catfish, and 42 ppb in carp.
 Its 48-hour LC50 in Daphnia magna, a small freshwater crustacean, is 0.34 ppb.
 The 96-hour LC50 for abamectin in pink shrimp (Panaeus duorarum) is 1.6 ppb, 0.022 ppb in mysid shrimp, 430 ppb in eastern oysters, and 153 ppb in blue crab (6).
 While the above LC50 values are quite low, indicating a high level of toxicity to aquatic organisms, actual concentrations of abamectin in surface waters (fresh water) adjacent to treated areas are expected to be low.
 Application rates of 0.025 pounds of abamectin per acre (the highest recommended rate) should result in concentrations no higher than 26 parts per trillion in adjacent surface waters one day after the application.
 Rapid photodegradation and adsorption to sediments should produce even lower concentrations within days.
 The degradation products of abamectin are less toxic to aquatic organisms than abamectin itself (6).
 Abamectin did not bioaccumulate in bluegill sunfish exposed to 0.099 ppb for 28 days in a flow-through tank.
 On day 28, the concentration of residues in the fish was 6.8 ppb, but this rapidly decreased to 0.32 ppb by day 42.
 The BCF value calculated from this study is 52, indicating that abamectin does not accumulate or persist in fish (6).
 Effects on Other Animals (Nontarget species) species)
 Abamectin is highly toxic to bees, with a 24-hour contact LC50 of 0.002 ug/bee and an oral LD50 of 0.009 ug/bee.
 Rapid degradation of abamectin will reduce the risk of bee deaths.
 Citrus and alfalfa foliage was not toxic to bees 24 to 48 hours after treatment with abamectin (6).
 The 28-day LC50 for abamectin in earthworms is 28 ppm.
 Earthworms will not be adversely affected by use of abamectin at recommended application rates.
 ENVIRONMENTAL FATE FATE
 Breakdown of Chemical in Soil and Groundwater Groundwater
 Because abamectin is nearly insoluble in water and has a strong tendency to bind to soil particles, it is therefore immobile in soil and unlikely to leach or contaminate groundwater (6, 7).
 Compounds produced by the degradation of abamectin are also immobile and unlikely to contaminate groundwater (6).
 Abamectin is rapidly degraded in soil.
 At the soil surface, it is subject to rapid photodegradation, with half-lives of 8 and 21 hours (6) or 1 day (7) reported.
 When applied to the soil surface and not shaded, its soil half-life was about 1 week.
 Under dark, aerobic conditions, the soil half-life was 2 weeks to 2 months (7).
 The half-life for avermectin B1a in fine sandy loam, clay and construction grade sand was 20 to 47 days.
 Loss of abamectin from these soils is thought to be due to microbial degradation because abamectin remained undegraded in sterile soil.
 The rate of degradation was significantly decreased under anaerobic conditions (6).
 Breakdown of Chemical in Surface Water Water
 Abamectin is rapidly degraded in water.
 After an initial distribution, its half-life in artificial pond water was 4 days.
 Its half- life in pond sediment was 2 to 4 weeks (6).
 It undergoes rapid photodegradation, with a half-life of 12 hours in water (6, 7).
 When tested at pH levels common to surface and groundwater (pH 5, 7, and 9), abamectin did not hydrolyze (6).
 Breakdown of Chemical in Vegetation Vegetation
 Plants do not absorb abamectin from the soil (6).
 Abamectin is subject to rapid degradation when present as a thin film, as on treated leaf surfaces.
 Under laboratory conditions and in the presence of light, its half-life as a thin film was 4 to 6 hours (6).
 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND GUIDELINES GUIDELINES
 Abamectin is a white to yellowish crystalline powder (4).
 It poses a slight fire hazard if exposed to heat or flame, and a fire and explosion hazard in the presence of strong oxidizers.
 It may burn but will not readily ignite.
 Avoid contact with strong oxidizers, excessive heat, sparks or open flame.
 Thermal decomposition may release toxic oxides of carbon (3).
 Workers handling abamectin should wear goggles to prevent eye contact and protective clothing to prevent prolonged skin contact (3).
 Exposure Guidelines:
 No occupational exposure limits have been established for abamectin by OSHA, NIOSH or ACGIH (3).
 Abamectin, also known as Avermectin.
 A naturally derived acaricide/insecticide first introduced in 1985 1985
 Long lasting residual control up to 30 days.
 Comes as a white or yellowish crystal, poor solubility in water, dissolves well in ethyl acetate, ethanol, chloroform.
 Abamectin, as with other insecticides works to stimulate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, a chemical �transmitter� produced at nerve endings, which inhibits both nerve to nerve and nerve to muscle communication.
 The affected insect becomes paralyzed, stops feeding, and dies after a few days.
 Abamectin breaks down in the soil quickly through photodegradation at the surface and microbial activity lower down in dark and aerobic conditions.
 Also rapid breakdown in water with a half life of about 4 days in pond water though 2 to 4 weeks in sediment.

 Abamectin Abamectin
 Trade and Other Names:
 Abamectin is also known as Avermectin B1a.
 Trade names include Affirm, Agri-Mek, Avermectin, Avid, MK 936, Vertimec, and Zephyr.
 Regulatory Status:
 Abamectin is a General Use Pesticide (GUP).
 It is classified as toxicity class IV - practically nontoxic, and has no precautionary statement on its label.
 Chemical Class:
 Insecticide/miticide Insecticide/miticide
 Introduction:
 Abamectin is a mixture of avermectins containing about 80% avermectin B1a and 20% avermectin B1b.
 These two components, B1a and B1b, have very similar biological and toxicological properties.
 The avermectins are insecticidal/miticidal compounds derived from the soil bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis.
 Abamectin is a natural fermentation product of this bacterium.
 It acts as an insecticide by affecting the nervous system of and paralyzing insects.
 Abamectin is used to control insect and mite pests of citrus, pear, and nut tree crops, and it is used by homeowners for control of fire ants.
 Formulation:
 Not Available Available
 Toxicological Effects:
 Acute toxicity:
 Abamectin is highly toxic to insects and may be highly toxic to mammals as well [141].
 Emulsifiable concentrate formulations may cause slight to moderate eye irritation and mild skin irritation [8].
 Symptoms of poisoning observed in laboratory animals include pupil dilation, vomiting, convulsions and/or tremors, and coma [141,142].
 Abamectin acts on insects by interfering with the nervous system.
 At very high doses, it can affect mammals, causing symptoms of nervous system depression such as incoordination, tremors, lethargy, excitation, and pupil dilation.
 Very high doses have caused death from respiratory failure [143].
 Abamectin is not readily absorbed through skin.
 Tests with monkeys show that less than 1% of dermally applied abamectin was absorbed into the bloodstream through the skin [141].
 Abamectin does not cause allergic skin reactions [142].
 The oral LD50 for abamectin in rats is 10 mg/kg, and in mice ranges from 14 mg/kg to greater than 80 mg/kg [141,142].
 The oral LD50 for the product Avid EC in rats is 650 mg/kg [8].
 The dermal LD50 for technical abamectin in rats and rabbits is greater than 330 mg/kg [144].
 Chronic toxicity:
 In a 1-year study with dogs given oral doses of abamectin, dogs at the 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day doses exhibited pupil dilation, weight loss, lethargy, tremors, and recumbency [141].
 Similar results were seen in a 2-year study with rats fed 0.75, 1.5, or 2 mg/kg/day.
 Rats at all the dosage levels exhibited body weight gains significantly higher than the controls.
 A few individuals in the high dose group exhibited tremors [141].
 When mice were fed 8 mg/kg/day for 94 weeks, the males developed dermatitis and changes in blood formation in the spleen, while females exhibited tremors and weight loss [142].
 Reproductive effects:
 Rats given 0.40 mg/kg/day of abamectin had increased stillbirths, decreased pup viability, decreased lactation, and decreased pup weights [142].
 These data suggest that abamectin may have the protential to cause reproductive effects at high enough doses.
 Teratogenic effects:
 Abamectin produced cleft palate in the offspring of treated mice and rabbits, but only at doses that were also toxic to the mothers [141].
 There were no birth defects in the offspring of rats given up to 1 mg/kg/day [142].
 Abamectin is unlikely to cause teratogenic effects except at doses toxic to the mother.
 Mutagenic effects:
 Abamectin does not appear to be mutagenic.
 Mutagenicity tests in live rats and mice were negative.
 Abamectin was shown to be nonmutagenic in the Ames test .
 Carcinogenic effects:
 Abamectin is not carcinogenic in rats or mice.
 The rats were fed dietary doses of up to 2 mg/kg/day for 24 months, and the mice were up to 8 mg/kg/day for 22 months [141].
 These represent the maximum tolerated doses.
 Organ toxicity:
 Animal studies indicate that abamectin may affect the nervous system.
 Fate in humans and animals:
 Tests with laboratory animals show that ingested avermectin B1a is not readily absorbed into the bloodstream by mammals and that it is rapidly eliminated from the body within 2 days via the feces [142].
 Rats given single oral doses of avermectin B1a excreted 69 to 82% of the dose unchanged in the feces.
 The average half-life of avermectin B1a in rat tissue is 1.2 days [144].
 Lactating goats given daily oral doses for 10 days excreted 89% of the administered avermectin, mainly in the feces.
 Less than 1% was recovered in the urine [144].
 Ecological Effects:
 Effects on birds:
 Abamectin is practically nontoxic to birds [142].
 The LD50 for abamectin in bobwhite quail is >2000 mg/kg.
 The dietary LC50 is 3102 ppm in bobwhite quail [145].
 There were no adverse effects on reproduction when mallard ducks were fed dietary doses of 3, 6, or 12 ppm for 18 weeks [145].
 Effects on aquatic organisms:
 Abamectin is highly toxic to fish and extremely toxic to aquatic invertebrates [142].
 Its LC50 (96-hour) is 0.003 mg/L in rainbow trout, 0.0096 mg/L in bluegill sunfish, 0.015 mg/L in sheepshead minnows, 0.024 mg/L in channel catfish, and 0.042 mg/L in carp.
 Its 48-hour LC50 in Daphnia magna, a small freshwater crustacean, is 0.003 mg/L.
 The 96-hour LC50 for abamectin is 0.0016 mg/L in pink shrimp, 430 mg/L in eastern oysters, and 153 mg/L in blue crab [145].
 While highly toxic to aquatic organisms, actual concentrations of abamectin in surface waters adjacent to treated areas are expected to be low.
 Abamectin did not bioaccumulate in bluegill sunfish exposed to 0.099 ug/L for 28 days in a flow-through tank.
 The levels in fish were from 52 to 69 times the ambient water concentration, indicating that abamectin does not accumulate or persist in fish [145].
 Effects on other organisms:
 Abamectin is highly toxic to bees, with a 24-hour contact LC50 of 0.002 ug/bee and an oral LD50 of 0.009 ug/bee [145].
 Environmental Fate:
 Breakdown in soil and groundwater:
 Abamectin is rapidly degraded in soil.
 At the soil surface, it is subject to rapid photodegradation, with half-lives of 8 hours to 1 day reported [142,145].
 When applied to the soil surface and not shaded, its soil half-life is about 1 week.
 Under dark, aerobic conditions, the soil half-life was 2 weeks to 2 months [142].
 Loss of abamectin from soils is thought to be due to microbial degradation.
 The rate of degradation was significantly decreased under anaerobic conditions [145].
 Because abamectin is nearly insoluble in water and has a strong tendency to bind to soil particles, it is immobile in soil and unlikely to leach or contaminate groundwater [145].
 Compounds produced by the degradation of abamectin are also immobile and unlikely to contaminate groundwater [145].
 Breakdown in water:
 Abamectin is rapidly degraded in water.
 After initial distribution, its half-life in artificial pond water was 4 days.
 Its half-life in pond sediment was 2 to 4 weeks [145].
 It undergoes rapid photodegradation, with a half-life of 12 hours in water [142].
 When tested at pH levels common to surface and groundwater (pH 5, 7, and 9), abamectin did not hydrolyze [145].
 Breakdown in vegetation:
 Plants do not absorb abamectin from the soil [145].
 Abamectin is subject to rapid degradation when present as a thin film, as on treated leaf surfaces.
 Under laboratory conditions and in the presence of light, its half-life as a thin film was 4 to 6 hours [145].
 Abamectin (Avermectin) (Avermectin)
 Beyond pesticides Rating:
 Toxic Toxic
 The active ingredient of many abamectin products, like AvidTM, ZephyrTM, VertimecTM or Agri-MekTM, is actually a mixture of 80% avermectin B1a and 20% avermectin B1b (FCH 2000).
 These B1a and B1b avermectins are purified from a chemically complex insecticidal/miticidal toxin produced by an actinomycete bacterium, Streptomyces avermitilis, found in soil.
 Although, abamectin is a natural fermentation product of this bacterium, the pesticide is classified by the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a class II toxicity pesticide on a scale of I to IV, I being the most toxic.
 Abamectin has been fully evaluated by EPA for its effects on human health or the environment.
 Mode of Action Action
 Like most other insecticides, avermectins are nerve poisons.
 They stimulate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, a chemical �transmitter� produced at nerve endings, which inhibits both nerve to nerve and nerve to muscle communication.
 The affected insect becomes paralyzed, stops feeding, and dies after a few days.
 AvidTM, used against mites and leaf-miners, is said to spare some of the major parasites of the miner and some predacious mites.
 When applied to foliage, it is absorbed by the leaves, where feeding insects encounter the poison.
 Toxicity Toxicity
 Technical avermectin is quite acutely toxic, with an oral rat LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of the test rats) of 30 mg/kg.
 EPA reviewed toxicological data from the manufacturer in connection with a 1987 petition for establishment of a tolerance in citrus oil and citrus pulp.
 EPA�s reviewers found that avermectin does not cause birth defects in rats and rabbits, but can cause cleft palate in mice.
 The calculated �lowest effect level (LEL)� for the latter effect was quite low at 0.10 mg/kg/day.
 EPA reviewers stated that �studies on mutagenicity demonstrated an overall negative potential (ETN 1996).
 Abamectin has been shown to cause pupil dilation, mild skin irritation, vomiting, convulsions and/or tremors and coma in laboratory animals.
 Because it is a nerve poison, it can also cause nervous system depression in mammals at very high doses.
 A study in rats given 0.40 mg/kg/day of abamectin showed decreased lactation, increased stillbirths and an increased likelihood of producing unhealthy offspring, demonstrating a strong chance of similar effects in humans at high enough doses.
 Abamectin is also very toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates (FCH 2000).
 Environmental Fate Fate
 Abamectin is broken down quickly in the soil via photodegradation at the soil surface and microbial degradation in dark, aerobic conditions.
 The chemicals half-life is about 1 week on an unshaded soil surface and about two weeks to two months underneath the soil surface.
 It is also rapidly broken down in water, its half-life being four days in pond water and two to four weeks in pond sediment (ETN 1996).

 Summary of Petitioned-For Tolerance Tolerance
 Back to Top Top
 In the Federal Register of August 11, 2010 (75 FR 48667) (FRL-8840-6), EPA issued a notice pursuant to section 408(d)(3) of FFDCA, 21 U.S.C.
 346a(d)(3), announcing the filing of a pesticide petition (PP 0E7738) by IR-4, 500 College Rd.
 East, Suite 201W, Princeton, NJ 08540.
  That notice referenced a summary of the petition prepared on behalf of IR-4 by Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc., the registrant, which is available in the docket, http://www.regulations.gov.
 There were no comments received in response to the notice of filing.
 Based upon review of the data supporting the petition, EPA has revised the proposed tolerance for chive, dried leaves.
 Additionally, the Agency has revised the tolerance expression for all established commodities to be consistent with current Agency policy.
 The reasons for these changes are explained in Unit IV.C.
 III.
 Aggregate Risk Assessment and Determination of Safety Safety
 Back to Top Top
 Section 408(b)(2)(A)(i) of FFDCA allows EPA to establish a tolerance (the legal limit for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food) only if EPA determines that the tolerance is �safe.� 
Section 408(b)(2)(A)(ii) of FFDCA defines �safe� to mean that �there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.� 
This includes exposure through drinking water and in residential settings, but does not include occupational exposure.
 Section 408(b)(2)(C) of FFDCA requires EPA to give special consideration to exposure of infants and children to the pesticide chemical residue in establishing a tolerance and to �ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue.
 Consistent with section 408(b)(2)(D) of FFDCA, and the factors specified in section 408(b)(2)(D) of FFDCA, EPA has reviewed the available scientific data and other relevant information in support of this action.
 EPA has sufficient data to assess the hazards of and to make a determination on aggregate exposure for abamectin (avermectin) including exposure resulting from the tolerances established by this action.
 EPA's assessment of exposures and risks associated with abamectin (avermectin) follows.
 A.
 Toxicological Profile Profile
 EPA has evaluated the available toxicity data and considered its validity, completeness, and reliability as well as the relationship of the results of the studies to human risk.
 EPA has also considered available information concerning the variability of the sensitivities of major identifiable subgroups of consumers, including infants and children.
 Abamectin (avermectin) has moderate to high acute toxicity by the oral route, high acute toxicity by the inhalation route, and low acute toxicity by the dermal route.
 It is slightly irritating to the skin, but is not an ocular irritant or a dermal sensitizer.
 The main target organ for abamectin (avermectin) is the nervous system.
 Neurotoxicity and developmental effects were detected in multiple studies and species of test animals.
 Signs of neurotoxicity were reported in studies of rats, mice, and dog and included decreases in foot splay reflex, mydriasis, curvature of the spine, decreased fore- and hind-limb grip strength, tip-toe gate, tremors, ataxia, or spastic movements of the limbs.
 Decreased body weight was also one of the most frequent findings.
 Severe effects, including death and morbid sacrifice, were noted in studies with rats and mice following repeated exposures.
 Increased qualitative and/or quantitative susceptibility was seen in prenatal developmental toxicity studies in mice and rabbits, and the reproductive toxicity and developmental neurotoxicity studies in rats.
 Developmental data indicate that the most sensitive effect of abamectin (avermectin) on fetuses is the increase in the incidence of cleft palates in mice and rabbits in the presence of no or minimal maternal toxicity.
 No maternal or developmental toxicity was seen in the prenatal developmental toxicity study in rats.
 The rat reproductive toxicity studies (two 1-generation reproduction studies and a 2-generation reproduction study) noted decreased pup body weights and/or survival at lower dose levels than those that caused parental toxicity.
 The developmental neurotoxicity studies in rats noted pup mortality and/or decreased body weights in the absence of maternal toxicity; there were no signs of neurotoxicity noted.
 In both the rat reproduction and a developmental neurotoxicity study, the data clearly indicated that the decrease in pup body weight seen at one dose level rapidly progressed to death at the next higher tested dose level.
 Oncogenicity and mutagenicity studies provide no indication that abamectin (avermectin) is carcinogenic or mutagenic; abamection (avermectin) has been classified as �not likely to be carcinogenic to humans.� humans.�
 Specific information on the studies received and the nature of the adverse effects caused by abamectin (avermectin) as well as the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) from the toxicity studies can be found at http://www.regulations.gov in document:

 Toxicological Points of Departure/Levels of Concern Concern
 Once a pesticide's toxicological profile is determined, EPA identifies toxicological points of departure (POD) and levels of concern to use in evaluating the risk posed by human exposure to the pesticide.
 For hazards that have a threshold below which there is no appreciable risk, the toxicological POD is used as the basis for derivation of reference values for risk assessment.
 PODs are developed based on a careful analysis of the doses in each toxicological study to determine the dose at which the NOAEL and the LOAEL.
 Uncertainty/safety factors are used in conjunction with the POD to calculate a safe exposure level�generally referred to as a population-adjusted dose (PAD) or a reference dose (RfD)�and a safe margin of exposure (MOE).
 For non-threshold risks, the Agency assumes that any amount of exposure will lead to some degree of risk.
 Thus, the Agency estimates risk in terms of the probability of an occurrence of the adverse effect expected in a lifetime.
 For more information on the general principles EPA uses in risk characterization and a complete description of the risk assessment process, see http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/factsheets/riskassess.htm.
 A summary of the toxicological endpoints for abamectin (avermectin) used for human risk assessment is shown in Table 1 of this unit.

 C.
 Exposure Assessment Assessment
 1.
 Dietary exposure from food and feed uses.
 In evaluating dietary exposure to abamectin (avermectin), EPA considered exposure under the petitioned-for tolerances as well as all existing abamectin (avermectin) tolerances in 40 CFR 180.449.
 EPA assessed dietary exposures from abamectin (avermectin) in food as follows:
 i.
 Acute exposure.
 Quantitative acute dietary exposure and risk assessments are performed for a food-use pesticide, if a toxicological study has indicated the possibility of an effect of concern occurring as a result of a 1-day or single exposure.
 Such effects were identified for abamectin (avermectin).
 In estimating acute dietary exposure, EPA used food consumption information from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 1994-1996 and 1998 Nationwide Continuing Surveys of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII).
 As to residue levels in food, EPA utilized tolerance level residues for the proposed crops and okra and anticipated residues for the remaining commodities.
 Empirical processing factors and percent crop treated (PCT) data were also used, when available.
 ii.
 Chronic exposure.
 In conducting the chronic dietary exposure assessment EPA used the food consumption data from the USDA 1994-1996 and 1998 CSFII.
 As to residue levels in food, EPA utilized tolerance level residues for the proposed crops and okra, and average residues from field trials for the remaining crops.
 Empirical processing factors and PCT were also used, when available.
 iii.
 Cancer.
 Based on the data summarized in Unit III.A., EPA has concluded that abamectin (avermectin) does not pose a cancer risk to humans.
 Therefore, a dietary exposure assessment for the purpose of assessing cancer risk is unnecessary.
 iv.
 Anticipated residue and PCT information.
 Section 408(b)(2)(E) of FFDCA authorizes EPA to use available data and information on the anticipated residue levels of pesticide residues in food and the actual levels of pesticide residues that have been measured in food.
 If EPA relies on such information, EPA must require pursuant to FFDCA section 408(f)(1) that data be provided 5 years after the tolerance is established, modified, or left in effect, demonstrating that the levels in food are not above the levels anticipated.
 For the present action, EPA will issue such data call-ins as are required by FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(E) and authorized under FFDCA section 408(f)(1).
 Data will be required to be submitted no later than 5 years from the date of issuance of these tolerances.
 Section 408(b)(2)(F) of FFDCA states that the Agency may use data on the actual percent of food treated for assessing chronic dietary risk only if:
 Condition A:
 The data used are reliable and provide a valid basis to show what percentage of the food derived from such crop is likely to contain the pesticide residue.
 Condition B:
 The exposure estimate does not underestimate exposure for any significant subpopulation group.
 Condition C:
 Data are available on pesticide use and food consumption in a particular area, the exposure estimate does not understate exposure for the population in such area.
 In addition, the Agency must provide for periodic evaluation of any estimates used.
 To provide for the periodic evaluation of the estimate of PCT as required by FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(F), EPA may require registrants to submit data on PCT.
 For the acute dietary assessment, the maximum PCT for existing uses were estimated as follows:
  For the chronic dietary assessment, the average PCT for existing uses were estimated as follows:
  In most cases, EPA uses available data from United States Department of Agriculture/National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA/NASS), proprietary market surveys, and the National Pesticide Use Database for the chemical/crop combination for the most recent 6-7 years.
 EPA uses an average PCT for chronic dietary risk analysis.
 The average PCT figure for each existing use is derived by combining available public and private market survey data for that use, averaging across all observations, and rounding to the nearest 5%, except for those situations in which the average PCT is less than one.
 In those cases, 1% is used as the average PCT and 2.5% is used as the maximum PCT.
 EPA uses a maximum PCT for acute dietary risk analysis.
 The maximum PCT figure is the highest observed maximum value reported within the recent 6 years of available public and private market survey data for the existing use and rounded up to the nearest multiple of 5%.
 The Agency believes that the three conditions discussed in Unit III.C.1.iv.
 have been met.
 With respect to Condition A, PCT estimates are derived from Federal and private market survey data, which are reliable and have a valid basis.
 The Agency is reasonably certain that the percentage of the food treated is not likely to be an underestimation.
 As to Conditions B and C, regional consumption information and consumption information for significant subpopulations is taken into account through EPA's computer-based model for evaluating the exposure of significant subpopulations including several regional groups.
 Use of this consumption information in EPA's risk assessment process ensures that EPA's exposure estimate does not understate exposure for any significant subpopulation group and allows the Agency to be reasonably certain that no regional population is exposed to residue levels higher than those estimated by the Agency.
 Other than the data available through national food consumption surveys, EPA does not have available reliable information on the regional consumption of food to which abamectin (avermectin) may be applied in a particular area.
 2.
 Dietary exposure from drinking water.
 The Agency used screening level water exposure models in the dietary exposure analysis and risk assessment for abamectin (avermectin) in drinking water.
 These simulation models take into account data on the physical, chemical, and fate/transport characteristics of abamectin (avermectin).
 Further information regarding EPA drinking water models used in pesticide exposure assessment can be found at http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/models/water/index.htm.
  Modeled estimates of drinking water concentrations were directly entered into the dietary exposure model.
 For acute dietary risk assessment, the water concentration value of 2.3 ppb was used to assess the contribution to drinking water.
 For chronic dietary risk assessment, the water concentration of value 1.3 ppb was used to assess the contribution to drinking water.
 3.
 From non-dietary exposure.
 The term �residential exposure� is used in this document to refer to non-occupational, non-dietary exposure (e.g., for lawn and garden pest control, indoor pest control, termiticides, and flea and tick control on pets).
 Abamectin (avermectin) is currently registered for the following uses that could result in residential handler and postapplication exposures:
 Granular baits used to treat lawns and indoor crack and crevice dust products.
 EPA assessed residential exposure using the following assumptions:
 Adults were assessed for short- and intermediate-term residential handler and postapplication exposures (dermal and inhalation).
 Children were assessed for short- and intermediate-term postapplication dermal, inhalation, and incidental ingestion exposures (hand-to-mouth and object-to-mouth).
 Recreational exposures to turf are expected to be similar to, or less than, those described above, and were therefore not assessed.
 Further information regarding EPA standard assumptions and generic inputs for residential exposures may be found at http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/trac/science/trac6a05.pdf.
 4.
 Cumulative effects from substances with a common mechanism of toxicity.
 Section 408(b)(2)(D)(v) of FFDCA requires that, when considering whether to establish, modify, or revoke a tolerance, the Agency consider �available information� concerning the cumulative effects of a particular pesticide's residues and �other substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity.
 EPA has not found abamectin (avermectin) to share a common mechanism of toxicity with any other substances, and abamectin (avermectin) does not appear to produce a toxic metabolite produced by other substances.
 For the purposes of this tolerance action, therefore, EPA has assumed that abamectin (avermectin) does not have a common mechanism of toxicity with other substances.
 For information regarding EPA's efforts to determine which chemicals have a common mechanism of toxicity and to evaluate the cumulative effects of such chemicals, see EPA's Web site at http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/cumulative.
 D.
 Safety Factor for Infants and Children Children
 1.
 In general.
  This additional margin of safety is commonly referred to as the FQPA Safety Factor (SF).
 In applying this provision, EPA either retains the default value of 10X, or uses a different additional safety factor when reliable data available to EPA support the choice of a different factor.
 2.
 Prenatal and postnatal sensitivity.
 The abamectin (avermectin) toxicity database is adequate to evaluate potential increased susceptibility of infants and children, and includes developmental toxicity studies in rat, mice, and rabbits; two 1-generation rat reproductive toxicity studies in rat; a 2-generation reproductive toxicity study in rat; and two developmental neurotoxicity studies in rat.
 No developmental effects were seen in the rat developmental toxicity study.
 However, increased quantitative susceptibility was noted in the prenatal developmental toxicity studies in mice and rabbits, the rat reproductive toxicity studies, and the developmental neurotoxicity studies in rat.
 3.
 Conclusion.
 In previous abamectin (avermectin) risk assessments, the 10x FQPA safety factor was retained as a database uncertainty factor for the lack of a developmental neurotoxicity study.
 Two developmental neurotoxicity studies have now been submitted and reviewed and the findings in these studies were considered in the identification of toxicological points of departure and uncertainty/safety factors.
 EPA has determined that reliable data show the safety of infants and children would be adequately protected if the FQPA SF were reduced to 1X for the acute dietary assessment and 3X for all assessments other than acute dietary.
 That decision is based on the following findings:
 i.
 For all risk assessments involving repeated exposures to abamectin (avermectin), EPA determined that a 3x safety factor would be appropriate, based on the severity of effects (decrease in pup body weight and mortality) and the steepness of the dose-response curve seen in the developmental neurotoxicity study and three reproductive toxicity studies in the rat.
 These studies have documented a very narrow dose range from NOAEL (0.12 mg/kg/day) to adverse effect (0.2 mg/kg/day) to severe adverse effect (0.4 mg/kg/day).
 Dose spacing is commonly greater than 2x between NOAEL and LOAEL, and the 3x difference between the NOAEL and the dose that induced mortality in the pups in the developmental neurotoxicity study provides little margin of safety for the severity of the effects seen.
 Retaining an additional 3x FQPA safety factor effectively provides a 10x margin between the dose which causes death (0.4 mg/kg/day) and the NOAEL adjusted by the additional safety factor (0.12 mg/kg/day/3x = 0.04 mg/kg/day).
 A dose spacing of 10x between a NOAEL and LOAEL is as broad, if not broader, than the dose spacing generally used in animal testing and thus removes the residual concern of the steepness of the dose-response curve and the severe effects noted.
  With respect to acute dietary exposure, the endpoint selected for risk assessment is based on mydriasis observed in dogs.
 The EPA determined that the additional 3x factor applied to chronic and other exposure scenarios is not applicable to acute exposure for the following reasons:
 a.
 The concerns noted for steepness of the dose-response curve and the severity of effects were not seen in the studies where mydriasis occurred.
 b.
 The reduced body weights noted in studies following repeated exposure to abamectin (avermectin) are not a single dose effect.
 c.
 The increased susceptibility seen in the prenatal developmental toxicity studies, reproductive toxicity studies, and the developmental neurotoxicity studies were seen at a dose lower (LOAEL 0.2 mg/kg/day) than the dose (LOAEL 1.0 mg/kg/day) that caused mydriasis.
 Therefore, EPA has determined that it would be appropriate if the FQPA SF were reduced to 1X for the acute dietary assessment.
 ii.
 The toxicity database for abamectin (avermectin) is complete, except for immunotoxicity testing.
 Recent changes to 40 CFR part 158 imposed new data requirements for immunotoxicity testing (OPPTS Guideline 870.7800) for pesticide registration.
 However, the toxicity database for abamectin (avermectin) provides no indication of immunotoxicity and abamectin (avermectin) does not belong to a class of chemicals that would be expected to be immunotoxic.
 EPA does not believe that conducting an immunotoxicity study will result in a NOAEL less than the NOAELs of 0.5 mg/kg/day and 0.12 mg/kg/day already set for abamectin (avermectin) acute and repeated exposures, respectively, and an additional uncertainty factor is not needed to account for potential immunotoxicity.
 ii.
 Signs of neurotoxicity ranging from decrease in foot splay reflex, mydriasis (i.e., excessive dilation of the pupil), curvature of the spine, decreased fore- and hind-limb grip strength, tip-toe gate, tremors, ataxia, or spastic movements of the limbs were reported in various studies with different durations of abamectin (avermectin) exposure in rats, mice, and dogs.
 However, the results of two submitted rat developmental neurotoxicity studies did not show any evidence of neurotoxicity.
 iv.
 There are no residual uncertainties identified in the exposure databases.
 The acute and chronic dietary exposure assessments were refined and utilized tolerance level or anticipated residues, default or empirical processing factors, and PCT estimates.
 EPA made conservative (protective) assumptions in the ground and surface water modeling used to assess exposure to abamectin (avermectin) in drinking water.
 EPA used similarly conservative assumptions to assess postapplication exposure of children as well as incidental oral exposure of toddlers.
 These assessments will not underestimate the exposure and risks posed by abamectin (avermectin).
 E.
 Aggregate Risks and Determination of Safety Safety
 EPA determines whether acute and chronic dietary pesticide exposures are safe by comparing aggregate exposure estimates to the acute PAD (aPAD) and chronic PAD (cPAD).
 For linear cancer risks, EPA calculates the lifetime probability of acquiring cancer given the estimated aggregate exposure.
 Short-, intermediate-, and chronic-term risks are evaluated by comparing the estimated aggregate food, water, and residential exposure to the appropriate PODs to ensure that an adequate MOE exists.
 1.
 Acute risk.
 Using the exposure assumptions discussed in this unit for acute exposure, the acute dietary exposure from food and water to abamectin (avermectin) will occupy 30% of the aPAD for infants less than 1 year old, the population group receiving the greatest exposure.
 2.
 Chronic risk.
 Using the exposure assumptions described in this unit for chronic exposure, EPA has concluded that chronic exposure to abamectin (avermectin) from food and water will utilize 50% of the cPAD for children 1-2 years old the population group receiving the greatest exposure.
 Based on the explanation in Unit III.C.3., regarding residential use patterns, chronic residential exposure to residues of abamectin (avermectin) is not expected.
 3.
 Short- and intermediate-term risk.
 Short- and intermediate-term aggregate exposure takes into account short- and intermediate-term residential exposure plus chronic exposure to food and water (considered to be a background exposure level).
 Abamectin (avermectin) is currently registered for uses that could result in short- and intermediate-term residential exposures, and the Agency has determined that it is appropriate to aggregate chronic exposure through food and water with short- and intermediate-term residential exposures to abamectin (avermectin).
 Using the exposure assumptions described in this unit for short- and intermediate-term exposures, EPA has concluded the combined short- and intermediate-term food, water, and residential exposures result in aggregate MOEs of 1200 for the general population and 500 for children 1-2 years old.
 Because EPA's level of concern for abamectin (avermectin) is a MOE of 300 or below, these MOEs are not of concern.
 4.
 Aggregate cancer risk for U.S.
 population.
 Based on the lack of evidence of carcinogenicity in two adequate rodent carcinogenicity studies, abamectin (avermectin) is not expected to pose a cancer risk to humans.
 5.
 Determination of safety.
 Based on these risk assessments, EPA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to the general population, or to infants and children from aggregate exposure to abamectin (avermectin) residues.
 IV.
 Other Considerations Considerations
 Back to Top Top
 A.
 Analytical Enforcement Methodology Methodology
 Adequate enforcement methodologies are available in Pesticide Analytical Manual II (PAM II) for citrus and processed fractions (Method I), ginned cottonseed (Method IA), and bovine tissues and milk (Method II).
 Additionally, Method M-073 and M-936-95-2 have been validated by the Agency and submitted for inclusion in PAM II as enforcement methods.
 These five methods are adequate for enforcement of the tolerances on plants and livestock.
 Method M-073 and M-936-95-2 may be requested from:
 Chief, Analytical Chemistry Branch, Environmental Science Center, 701 Mapes Rd., Ft.
 Meade, MD 20755-5350; telephone number:
 (410) 305-2905; email address:
 residuemethods@epa.gov.
 B.
 International Residue Limits Limits
 In making its tolerance decisions, EPA seeks to harmonize U.S.
 tolerances with international standards whenever possible, consistent with U.S.
 food safety standards and agricultural practices.
 EPA considers the international maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex), as required by FFDCA section 408(b)(4).
 The Codex Alimentarius is a joint U.N.
 Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization food standards program, and it is recognized as an international food safety standards-setting organization in trade agreements to which the United States is a party.
 EPA may establish a tolerance that is different from a Codex MRL; however, FFDCA section 408(b)(4) requires that EPA explain the reasons for departing from the Codex level.
 There are currently no Codex MRLs for abamectin (avermectin) on commodities associated with this petition.
 C.
 Revisions to Petitioned-For Tolerances Tolerances
 Based upon review of the data supporting the petition, EPA revised the proposed tolerance for chive, dried leaves from 0.07 ppm to 0.02 ppm.
 EPA revised the tolerance level based on analysis of the residue field trial data using the Agency's Tolerance Spreadsheet in accordance with the Agency's Guidance for Setting Pesticide Tolerances Based on Field Trial Data.
 Additionally, the Agency has revised the tolerance expression to clarify:
 1.
 That, as provided in FFDCA section 408(a)(3), the tolerance covers metabolites and degradates of abamectin (avermectin) not specifically mentioned; and and
 2.
 That compliance with the specified tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring only the specific compounds mentioned in the tolerance expression.
 V.
 Conclusion Conclusion
 Back to Top Top
  This regulation additionally removes the time-limited tolerances on bean, lima, seed at 0.005 ppm; and onion, bulb at 0.005 ppm, as they will be superseded by permanent tolerances.
 VI.
 Statutory and Executive Order Reviews Reviews
 Back to Top Top
 This final rule establishes tolerances under section 408(d) of FFDCA in response to a petition submitted to the Agency.
 The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these types of actions from review under Executive Order 12866, entitled Regulatory Planning and Review (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993).
 Because this final rule has been exempted from review under Executive Order 12866, this final rule is not subject to Executive Order 13211, entitled Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) or Executive Order 13045, entitled Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997).
 This final rule does not contain any information collections subject to OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C.
 3501 et seq., nor does it require any special considerations under Executive Order 12898, entitled Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).
 Since tolerances and exemptions that are established on the basis of a petition under section 408(d) of FFDCA, such as the tolerance in this final rule, do not require the issuance of a proposed rule, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C.
 601 et seq.) do not apply.
 This final rule directly regulates growers, food processors, food handlers, and food retailers, not States or tribes, nor does this action alter the relationships or distribution of power and responsibilities established by Congress in the preemption provisions of section 408(n)(4) of FFDCA.
 As such, the Agency has determined that this action will not have a substantial direct effect on States or tribal governments, on the relationship between the national government and the States or tribal governments, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government or between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.
 Thus, the Agency has determined that Executive Order 13132, entitled Federalism (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999) and Executive Order 13175, entitled Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000) do not apply to this final rule.
 In addition, this final rule does not impose any enforceable duty or contain any unfunded mandate as described under Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (Pub.
 L.
 104-4).
 This action does not involve any technical standards that would require Agency consideration of voluntary consensus standards pursuant to section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA), Public Law 104-113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C.
 272 note).
 VII.
 Congressional Review Act Act
 Back to Top Top
 The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C.
 801 et seq., generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States.
 EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S.
 Senate, the U.S.
 House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of this final rule in the Federal Register.
 This final rule is not a �major rule� as defined by 5 U.S.C.

 Abstract Abstract
 The rice grasshopper Oxya chinensis exhibits polymorphic loci at Ldh, Gpi, Pgm and Me.
 The data of the mean number of alleles per locus (A = 2.8), percentage of polymorphic loci (P = 80.0%), the observed mean heterozygosities (Ho = 0.271 approximately 0.279) and the expected mean heterozygosities (He = 0.305 approximately 0.316) of the species suggest that O.
 chinensis possesses sufficient genetic diversity.
 It was hypothesized that the high polymorphisms at Ldh, Gpi, Pgm and Me might make it possible for pesticide avermectin to act as a selective agent through differential lethality among the insect individuals with different genotypes.
 In this study a total of 855 grasshoppers were injected with avermectin (1.3 x 10(-2) g/g) to obtain a mortality of 54% after 24 hours.
 The allozyme analysis was then employed to determine the genotypes of Ldh, Gpi, Pgm and Me for both dead and surviving individuals.
 Contingency table chi2 tests showed that avermectin displayed random lethal effects on the genotypes at the loci of Ldh, Pgm and Me, without correlation between the genotype and mortality.
 In contrast, at Gpi locus, the grasshopper demonstrated a mortality cline of Gpi-AA (38%), Gpi-AB (51%), Gpi-BB (58%) and Gpi-BC (74%).
 The significant mortality differences were found among the following genotype pairs:
 Gpi-AA vs.
 Gpi-BB, Gpi-AA vs.
 Gpi-BC and Gpi-AB vs.
 Gpi-BC.
 These data implied the Gpi-AA genotype was likely related to the specie's resistance to the pesticide avermectin.
 It was also noted that the Gpi-A allele was present in the genotypes with low morality,while Gpi-B was present in the genotypes with moderate mortality, and the individuals with Gpi-C allele exhibited the highest mortality.
 The data obtained in this study suggested that the increasing proportion of Gpi-AA genotype and perhaps Gpi-A allele in a population may be useful as a potential resistant biomarker of O.
 chinensis to pesticide avermectin.

 Abstract Abstract
 The potential of emamectin benzoate (EB) to cause developmental neurotoxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats was assessed using a study design by the US EPA.
 Dosages of 0 (deionized water), 0.1, 0.6, or 3.6 mg/kg/day were administered at 5 ml/kg by oral gavage from gestational day (GD) 6 to lactational day (LD) 20 to groups of 25 mated females each.
 Between GD 17 and 20 the high dose was reduced to 2.5 mg/kg/day because of pup tremors observed at this dose level in a concurrent two-generation study.
 Females were allowed to deliver and the young were evaluated for survival, growth, development, behavior, and histological changes to brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and skeletal muscle.
 Behavioral assessment of the offspring consisted of open field motor activity, auditory startle habituation, and passive avoidance tests; each was conducted on weanling and adult animals (one animal/sex/litter).
 Histopathological examination of the CNS and PNS was conducted on one animal/sex/litter on postnatal days (PND) 11 and 60.
 There were significant increases in average F0 maternal body weight gains during gestation in the 0.6 and 3.6/2.5 mg/kg/day groups, but no other effects were observed in pregnant females of these or the low-dose groups during the study.
 Beginning on PND 6, tremors were observed in high-dose pups, and this was followed by hindlimb splay in all high-dose pups by PND 15-26.
 Both of these physical signs disappeared by PND 34 (i.e., 10-11 days after weaning).
 There were no compound-related deaths in F1 offspring.
 Beginning on PND 11, progressive decreases in preweaning average weights were observed in the high-dose group (to 42% below control in females on PND 21).
 Average weight gain during the postweaning period was significantly decreased in the 3.6/2.5 mg/kg/day group.
 There were EB-related effects in behavioral tests only in the high-dose group.
 A significant increase in PND 13 average horizontal motor activity was due to stereotypical movements.
 Average horizontal activity was decreased on PND 17 and in adult females, but there was no effects on PND 21.
 Average peak auditory startle response amplitude was decreased on PND 22 and in adults.
 There were no EB-related effects in the passive avoidance test, relative brain weights, or in the histological examination (including morphometry) of the nervous system.
 These results demonstrate that the high-dose EB exposure during gestation and lactation to rats produced evidence of neurotoxicity in the F1 offspring, and a clear No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for developmental neurotoxicity of EB was determined to be 0.6 mg/kg/day.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE:
 Avermectins have been used in the control of parasites and insects; however, human data concerning poisoning are lacking.
 This study investigated the clinical spectrum of avermectin poisoning.
 METHODS:
 A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate patients with avermectin poisoning reported to a poison center from September 1993 through December 1997.
 RESULTS:
 Eighteen patients with abamectin (Agri-Mek; 2% wt/wt abamectin) exposure and 1 with ivermectin (Ivomec; 1% wt/vol ivermectin) ingestion were identified.
 There were 14 male and 5 female patients, ranging in age from 15 to 83 years.
 Most patients were exposed as a result of attempted suicide (14).
 Oral ingestion (15) was the most common route of exposure.
 Four patients were asymptomatic, and 8 had minor symptoms after a mean ingestion of 23 mg/kg abamectin (4.2 to 67 mg/kg), or after dermal and inhalation contact.
 Seven patients manifested severe symptoms, such as coma (7), aspiration with respiratory failure (4), and hypotension (3), after a mean ingestion of 100.7 mg/kg avermectin (15.4 mg/kg for ivermectin and 114.9 mg/kg for abamectin).
 All 7 patients received intensive supportive care; 1 patient died 18 days later as a result of multiple organ failure.
 CONCLUSION:
 Ingestion of a large dose of avermectin may be associated with life-threatening coma, hypotension, and subsequent aspiration.
 Avermectin is a new antibiotic used for agriculture and animals.
 It has high bioactivity on mites and pests of many crops.
 It is also an ideal antibiotic insecticide and acaricide.
 It is broad-spectrum, highly effective, low residual and safe for people, animals and environment.
 In the first half of 2009, the prices of Chinese avermectin products continued to rise.
 Compared with the beginning of 2009, the price growth rate at the end of June rose by 50%.
 The sales status of avermectin products was much better compared with many other insecticide products.

 It is not considered to be mutagenic and does not sensitize skin.
 It is not readily absorbed by mammals and the majority of the residue is excreted in the feces within 2 days.
 The 24-month rat chronic feeding/ oncogenicity study and 94-week mouse chronic toxicity oncogenicity study were negative for oncogenic potential.
 The results of a series of developmental toxicity studies (rat, rabbit, mouse) have been evaluated and showed that avermectin B1 produces developmental toxicity (cleft palate) in the CF1 mouse.
 Toxicology data were also evaluated for the delta-8,9-isomer of avermectin B1 which is a plant photodegradate that can range between 5 and 20 percent of the residue on/in cottonseed.
 This isomer possesses avermectin-like toxicological activity.
 It was concluded that the delta 8,9-isomer also produces developmental toxicity (cleft palate) in mice, but not in rats.
 In addition to avermectin and its delta 8,9-isomer, toxicology data were also evaluated for the "polar degradates" of avermectin, which constitute a large percentage (up to 70%) of the total residue on cottonseed.
 Review of the toxicology data indicated that these polar degradates do not possess avermectin-like toxicological activity and for this reason need not be included in the tolerance expression for residues in/on cottonseed.
 Sufficient data are available to characterize avermectin from an environmental fate and ecological standpoint.
 Avermectin is extremely toxic to mammals and aquatic invertebrates and highly toxic to fish and bees.
 Avermectin is relatively non-toxic to birds.
 Based upon terrestrial residue analysis, aquatic runoff modeling and cluster analysis it appears that certain endangered species may be impacted by the use of avermectin on cotton.
 EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service are in the process of updating the cotton cluster.
 The results when available will be applicable to the registration of avermectin on cotton.
 Avermectin undergoes rapid photolysis, is readily degraded by soil microorganisms and, due to its binding properties and low water solubility, is expected to exhibit little or no potential for leaching; however, a complete assessment cannot be made until additional leaching and soil dissipation data are submitted.

 Environmental Characteristics:
 Avermectin is stable to hydrolysis at ph 5, 7, and 9 and thus is not expected to hydrolyze in the environment.
 It photodegrades rapidly in water and soil with half-lives of less than 12 hours and 1 day respectively.
 Soil metabolism studies conducted in darkness indicate degradation does occur with a half-life of 2 weeks to 2 months under aerobic conditions.
 Anaerobic degradation is slower.
 It is not expected to accumulate in fish.
 Avermectin's solubility in water is determined to be 7.8 ppb.
 The field dissipation study indicates that avermectin, when applied in the bait formulation directly to the soil, dissipates with a half-life of about a week but may persist longer if the bait is shaded.
 Due to its binding properties and low water solubility, Avermectin is expected to exhibit little or no potential for leaching; however, a determination cannot be made until the results of the analyses of the three remaining soil core replicates are submitted and evaluated.
 Also an absorption/desorption leaching study must be conducted since avermectin has shown conflicting results in soil thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) (immobile) and soil column studies.
 Tolerance Assessment Assessment
 A Section 408 tolerance under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Cosmetic
 Act has been established for residues of avermectin B1 and its delta 8,9-isomer in/on the following raw agricultural commodity (RAC) (40 CFR 180.___ ) )
 The acceptable daily intake (ADI), based on a NOEL of 0.12 mg/kg/day from a 2-generation rat reproduction study and safety factor of 300, is 0.0004 mg/kg/body weight (bwt) day.
 Because of developmental effects seen in animal studies the Agency used the rat reproduction study with a 300 fold safety factor to assess chronic dietary exposure and establish an ADI.
 The 300 fold safety factor was employed to account for (l) inter- and intra-species differences (2) and pup death observed in the reproduction study.
 (3) maternal toxicity (lethality) NOEL = 0.05 mg/kg/day, and (4) cleft palate in the mouse teratology study with the isomer, NOEL = 0.06 mg/kg/day.
 The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from the proposed tolerance as well as pending tolerances on celery, pears and tomatoes and temporary tolerances on citrus with secondary residues in meat and milk is 0.000052 mg/kg/day.
 This is equivalent to about 13 percent of the ADI.
 This analysis used tolerance level residues and 100 percent of crop treated.
 The TMRC from cotton only is .000001 representing less than 0.1 of the ADI.
 Because of adverse developmental effects seen in animal studies detailed acute dietary exposure analysis for this tolerance and pending tolerances for this chemical was also conducted using a NOEL of 0.06 mg/kg body weight for developmental effects.
 The food uses evaluated were the same as those evaluated in the chronic exposure analysis.
 The acute exposure analysis estimated the distribution of single-day exposures for the overall U.S.
 population and certain population subgroups.
 The analysis evaluated the individual food consumption, as reported by respondents in the 1977-78 USDA Food Consumption Survey, and accumulated exposure to avermectin for each food consumed for which a tolerance is being evaluated.
 Each analysis assumed that avermectin residues were present at tolerance level in all foods consumed.
 The toxicologic endpoint pertained to developmental toxicity.
 The subgroup of interest in this analysis was women aged 13 and above, which has the subgroup most closely approximating women of child-bearing age.
 Based upon this analysis the Margin of Safety (MOS) for the average woman of child bearing age was calculated to be 1579.
 None of the target population is expected to have a MOS less than 250.
 The nature of the residue in cottonseed is adequately defined.
 The residue of concern is the parent and its delta 8,9-isomer.
  There are no Canadian or Mexican tolerances and no Codex Maximum Residue Limits (MRLS) have been established for avermectin B1 and its delta 8,9-isomer in/on cotton.
 Therefore, no compatibility problem exists.
 4.
 SUMMARY OF REGULATORY POSITION AND RATIONALE RATIONALE
 The Agency has determined that it should allow the conditional registration of abamectin for agricultural use to control mites on cotton.
 Adequate data are available to assess the acute and chronic toxicological effects of abamectin to humans.
 However since long-term fish, aquatic and mammalian data are lacking and additional leaching and soil dissipation data are required, the registration is being conditionally approved with an expiration date of March 31, 1992.
 Due to the conditional status of the registration the Agency is also establishing the tolerance for this pesticide on cottonseed with an expiration date of March 31, 1993 to cover residues expected to be present during and for one year after the period of conditional registration.
 In view of the high toxicity of technical abamectin to fish, aquatic invertebrates and mammals and the potential hazard associated with exposure from the use on cotton the risk criteria for restricted use classification is exceeded and thus the Agency, is restricting use on cotton to certified applicators.
 Additional data are required to more adequately define the hazards to mammals, fish, and aquatic invertebrates.
 According to EPA's Ecological Effects Standard Evaluation Procedures presumption of unacceptable risk is triggered when the estimated environmental concentration (EEC) exceeds the bird or mammal LC50, or 1/2 the aquatic LC50 or EC50.
 According to EPA's assessments, these criteria are exceeded for mammals and aquatic invertebrates for the cotton use (mammal 1-day LC50 = 2.5 ppm, EEC = 4.8 ppm, aquatic invertebrate (freshwater) EC50 = 0.22 ppb, EEC = 0.6 ppb; estuarine invertebrate EC50 0.02 ppb, EEC = 0.6 ppb).
 Because of adverse developmental effects seen in animal studies non-dietary exposure analysis was also conducted with respect to exposure to mixer/loaders, applicators and harvesters.
 Based upon surrogate exposure data; persons wearing long pants, long-sleeved shirts, rubber gloves and dermal absorption data in the monkey, the calculated MOS for cotton crop applicators and workers were found to exceed 100 in all instances.
 This MOS is sufficient to adequately protect these workers.

 Avermectin is a new antibiotic used for agriculture and animals.
 It has high bioactivity on mites and pests of many crops.
 It is also an ideal antibiotic insecticide and acaricide.
 It is broad-spectrum, highly effective, low residual and safe for people, animals and environment.
 In the first half of 2009, the prices of Chinese avermectin products continued to rise.
 Compared with the beginning of 2009, the price growth rate at the end of June rose by 50%.
 The sales status of avermectin products was much better compared with many other insecticide products.
 The main reasons for the price growth in Chinese market in the first half of 2009 are as follows:
 1.
 After the prohibition of 5 hypertoxic pesticides, avermectin began to develop rapidly and its dosages were increased gradually.
 It had become a common pesticide in China.
 2.
 Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) producers adjusted the prices according to market supplies and demands.
 But the current production capacity of avermectin didn't increase significantly.
 3.
 In 2009, the pesticide preparation producers had large demands for avermectin APIs.
 The purchase quantity of avermectin APIs in 2009 was several times that of the previous years, increasing the price of avermectin stock solution.
 4.
 To promote the marketing of rice, cotton and other cash crops this year, many preparation producers used avermectin on rice leaf rollers, diamondback moths of crucifers, asparagus caterpillars, and cotton bollworms and so on, increasing the demands for avermectin.
 Therefore, the price of avermectin grew obviously.
 Though Chinese avermectin products performed outstandingly on both supply and marketing in the first half of 2009, it is estimated that the price growth rate in the latter half year will drop as the price has grown too fast.
 Due to the unsuitable usage of avermectins by farmers, pests have significantly strengthened their resistance capacities against avermectin products, which would speed up the development and promotion of substitutes.
 Therefore, the avermectin pesticide industry will face both opportunities and challenges in the next few years.

 Dogs and Pesticide Use Use
 Introduction Introduction
 More than 30 million Americans live with one or more dogs (Marks, 1999).
 Dog owners often use pesticides in and around their homes to control pests.
 Although many pesticides are beneficial, poor planning or improper use of a pesticide product can be very toxic to dogs.
 Of course the best way to avoid toxicity is to avoid using chemical products.
 However, if these chemicals must be used be sure to read the labels, use the products properly, and be extremely careful.
 Remember that dogs are not just property; they are another member of the family.
 Pesticides Pesticides
 A pesticide is any substance used to kill, repel, or otherwise control a pest.
 These include insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, rodenticides, and disinfectants.
 Apartments and houses are often hosts to common pests like cockroaches, ants, fungus, termites, and rats.
 Weeds, grubs, and aphids can get into lawns, flowers, and vegetable gardens.
 Because pesticides are designed to be toxic, they can pose a risk not only to children and adults but also to pets.
 Dogs are exposed to pesticides when they inhale, ingest, or absorb the product through the skin.
 Animal studies have shown that some pesticides can cause cancer, reproductive problems, birth defects, central nervous system disturbances, liver and kidney damage, and skin irritation.
 The following compounds are some of the pesticides used in homes and gardens:
 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).
 This pesticide is a chlorophenoxy compound that functions as a systemic herbicide and is used to control many types of broadleaf weeds.
 Classified as a General Use Pesticide (GUP), 2,4-D's diethylamine salt is a slightly toxic category III chemical when ingested orally.
 However, this product is classified as a highly highly
 toxic category I chemical when exposed to the eyes.
 Pesticides containing 2,4-D bear the signal words "danger � poison".
 Used in many commercial products, 2,4-D may be found in emulsion form, in aqueous solutions (salts), and as a dry compound.
 Although its carcinogenic status is not clear, canine malignant lymphoma has been associated with exposure to 2,4-D (Hayes et al., 1991).
 NOTE:
 If pesticide chemicals fall into the least toxic category, manufacturers no longer have to print signal words on the labels as of February 12, 2002.
 Avermectin B1 (Abamectin).
 This compound functions as an insecticide/miticide and is used by homeowners for the control of fire ants.
 Abamectin is classified as a GUP, practically nontoxic category IV chemical, which has no precautionary statement on its label.
 Abamectin contains about 80% avermectin B1a and 20% avermectin B1b compounds derived from the soil bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis.
 Research indicates that chronic abamectin toxicity can affect the nervous system of dogs and cause symptoms such as pupil dilation, lethargy, and tremors (Lankas and Gordon, 1989).
 Allethrin.
 This pesticide was the first of the pyrethroids widely produced as an insecticide (Vijverberg et al., 1990).
 This synthetic compound is used almost exclusively in homes and gardens for control of flies and and
 mosquitoes.
 Pesticides containing allethrin are slightly toxic category III chemicals and bear the signal word "caution" on the product label.
 However, containers of technical grade D-trans-allethrin bear the signal word "warning".
 Allethrin is used in many commercial products and is available as mosquito coils, mats, oil formulations, and as an aerosol spray.
 Research has indicated that dogs exposed continuously to D-allethrin were diagnosed with liver problems (World Health Organization, 1989).
 Bendiocarb.
 This compound is an insecticidal carbamate that is used to control mosquitoes, flies, wasps, ants, cockroaches, fleas, ticks, and other pests in homes.
 Most formulations of bendiocarb are classified as GUP, but a few formulations are classified as Restricted Use Pesticides (RUP), which may be purchased and used only by certified applicators.
 Bendiocarb is a moderately toxic category II chemical and carries the signal word "warning".
 Commercial pesticides containing bendiocarb are formulated as dusts, granules, ultra-low volume sprays, and as wettable powders.
 Bendiocarb is absorbed through all the normal routes of exposure, but it is generally excreted rapidly and does not accumulate in mammalian tissue.
 Signs associated with acute toxicity of carbamates in mammals are excessive salivation, chest discomfort, muscle tremors, and rarely death.
 Like other carbamate insecticides, bendiocarb is a reversible inhibitor of cholinesterase, an enzyme found in the liver, pancreas, heart, serum, and the white matter of brain.
 True cholinesterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter) to choline (an amino alcohol) and acetate.
 DCPA.
 This phthalate compound, also called chlorthal or chlorthal-dimethyl, is a pre-emergent herbicide used on annual grasses and annual broad-leaf weeds in vegetable crops.
 About 20% of the use of this compound in the United States is for homes and gardens.
 DCPA is classified as a GUP and is practically a nontoxic category IV chemical that bears the signal word "caution".
 Commercial products containing DCPA may be formulated as wettable powders, granules, or as suspension concentrates.
 Although the compound has a very low toxicity to mammals, research has indicated that dogs exposed continuously to DCPA experienced adverse effects in the liver (United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 1988).
 Diazinon.
 This product is a nonsystemic organophosphate insecticide used to control fleas, ants, and cockroaches in residential buildings, and sucking and leaf-eating insects on home gardens.
 Diazinon is classified as a RUP, which may be purchased and used only by a professional pest control operator.
 Depending on the formulation, it is a moderately toxic category II or slightly toxic category III chemical.
 Pesticides containing diazinon bear the signal word "warning" or "caution".
 This insecticidal organophosphate compound is used in many commercial products and is available in dust, granules, seed dressings, wettable powder, and emulsifiable solution formulations.
 In mammals, diazinon is metabolized and excreted through the urine and feces very rapidly.
 The toxic effects of the compound are due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, an essential nervous system enzyme.
 Malathion.
 This compound is a nonsystemic, wide-spectrum organophosphate insecticide suited for the control of sucking and chewing insects on fruits and vegetables.
 Malathion is also used to control mosquitoes, flies, household insects, and animal ectoparasites.
 Malathion is classified as a GUP and is a slightly toxic category III chemical.
 Pesticides that contain this chemical bear the signal word "caution".
 This insecticidal organophosphate compound is used in many commercial products and is available in an emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder, dustable powder, and ultra-low volume liquid formulations.
 Malathion has been shown to depress cholinesterase activity in animals, and can affect the central nervous and immune systems, adrenal glands, liver, and blood.
 Available evidence suggests that this chemical product is not carcinogenic, yet current data is inconclusive.
 Rotenone.
 This pesticide is a selective, non-specific botanical compound used in home gardens for insect control and on pets for lice and tick control.
 Rotenone is classified as a GUP, and, depending on the formulation, is classified as a highly toxic category I or a slightly toxic category III compound.
 Rotenone formulations that are highly toxic bear the signal word "danger," but "caution" in slightly toxic forms.
 This rotenoid plant extract is used in many commercial products, and it is available in crystalline preparations, emulsified solutions, and dusts.
 Research revealed that dogs exposed continuously to rotenone experienced vomiting, had reduced food consumption, and hence reduced weight gain (National Research Council, 1983).
 Warfarin.
 This compound is an anticoagulant rodenticide used for controlling mice and rats in and around homes and animal premises.
 This odorless and tasteless pesticide is only slightly dangerous to domestic animals when used as directed.
 Warfarin, classified as a GUP, bears the signal word "danger" for technical and high concentrations or the signal word "caution" for low concentrations and ready-to-use baits.
 Warfarin is found in a variety of commercial rodenticides and comes in water soluble, ready-to-use bait, concentrate, powder, liquid concentrate, nylon pouch, coated talc, and dust formulations.
 Signs and symptoms of animal exposure such as rapid breathing, weakness, pale mucous membranes, and hemorrhage are caused by the rodenticide's anti-clotting properties.
 The prothrombin content of the blood is reduced, and internal bleeding is induced.
 Prothrombin or factor II is a vitamin K-dependent single-polypeptide-chain glycoprotein involved in blood clotting--a mechanism that prevents blood loss at the site of an injury.
 Animals killed by warfarin exhibit extreme pallor of the skin, muscle, and viscera.
 Although the previously discussed chemical compounds are assigned a registration number from the EPA, the EPA is re-evaluating pesticides in light of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996.
 The EPA is currently engaged in a reregistration process in which some chemical pesticides might end up off the market.
 Already, the manufacturers of bendiocarb voluntarily cancelled the product, and diazinon registration will (expire) be cancelled with no provisions for existing stocks on December 31, 2004.
 Guidelines Guidelines
 As mentioned previously, the best way to avoid toxicity is to avoid using chemical pesticides altogether.
 An integrated pest management program may be the most effective strategy for controlling pests.
 This approach employs physical, mechanical, cultural, and biological strategies to keep pest numbers low.
 Least-toxic chemical pest control methods are used only as a last resort.
 The following pest control methods do not involve chemical pesticides:
 � Physical and Mechanical Controls.Use mulch to reduce weed growth.
 Use a hoe to cut up weeds.
 Manually remove weeds from your lawn and insects from your plants.
 Use a hose to wash out aphid populations.
 Use shears to trim out caterpillars.
 Use traps or barriers (caulk, screen, net) to control mice, rats, and some insects.
 � Cultural Controls.
 Use compatible plants for the landscape.
 Avoid monocultures.
 Correct watering and fertilizing procedures.
 � Biological Controls.
 Attract and keep beneficial predators.
 Insect pests may be eaten by birds such as the purple martin and by predatory insects such as the ladybug.
 Contact your county Cooperative Extension office or local nursery for more information on how to attract and keep beneficial predators.
 Use parasitoids and pathogens.
 Parasitoids lay eggs in or on an insect host.
 Once the eggs hatch, the offspring kill the insect host by consuming its organs or body fluids.
 A common example is the mini mini
 wasp, which lays its eggs on pest larvae.
 Microscopic pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi invade pests and cause diseases.
 A disease often weakens and kills the pest.
 For example, the milky spore disease is known to attack Japanese beetles.
 If you decide that the best solution to your pest problem is to use chemical pesticides, then be aware that these products can be hazardous to you and your dog, especially when handled, applied, stored, or disposed of improperly.
 The following are some basic steps to avoid risking the health of your dog:
 Choose the pesticide that is least toxic.
 Every time you use the pesticide, read and follow all label directions.
 Keep your dog in a safe place while you mix or apply pesticides.
 Always keep the pesticides in the original container.
 Store pesticides in a ventilated, dry and cool place, preferably where your dog cannot gain access.
 Wrap empty, rinsed containers in newspaper and dispose of them in your trash can.
 However, any unused pesticide product that can no longer be used should be taken to the local household hazardous waste disposal facility.
 Keep your dog away from treated areas until the pesticide is completely dry.
 Always read the pesticide label for specific instructions as to how long to keep the dog out of the treated area.
 Place ready-to-use baits in areas where your dog cannot reach them.
 Use care when treating your dog with pesticides.
 Follow the label carefully, and be aware that over-treating can poison your dog.
 Pesticides designed for adult dogs should never be used on puppies, unless the label states that the chemical product may be used on younger animals.
 If after a recent pesticide application your dog starts to act strangely, salivate, vomit, stumble, appear lethargic, or have muscle tremors or convulsions, immediately contact a veterinarian or the National Animal Poison Control Center of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to to
 Animals (ASPCA) (1-800-548-2423).
 Make sure to have in hand the chemical product your dog may have been exposed to earlier.
 Summary Summary
 For years, dogs have alleviated the physical hardship and loneliness of humans.
 Today, dog companionship has taken on a new meaning as Americans increasingly consider their dogs another member of the family rather than just property.
 However, owners must understand that choosing to share their homes and lives with one or more dogs means that certain things must be done to secure a happy and healthy animal.
 Regular veterinary checkups, optimal nutrition, and protection against injuries and toxic chemicals are extremely important.
 Dog owners should become aware of the identity and toxic nature of pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, rodenticides, and disinfectants) that may be applied in or around their homes.
 Owners must realize that these chemical products can be as deadly to their dogs as they are to pests.
 Therefore, reading the label carefully and using pesticides properly is key to the safety of their dogs.
 Furthermore, educational programs in the area of pesticide use are essential for the protection of owner and dog health.

 industry self-help market rebound rebound
 Emamectin benzoate - Abamectin:
 industry self-help, market rebound, Avermectin drug market by some companies selling low-cost prices suffered a blow as Waterloo, the industry into an unprecedented low.
 Shandong Shengli shares represented Avermectin drug manufacturers, industry self-help organization, the courage to bear the responsibility of the industry, the acquisition of part of the market sell-off of the original avermectin drug products, to stabilize the market price, this move will to severe avermectin industry market a shot in the arm.
 At this point, market confidence in the market to reproduce abamectin warmer.
 5 months late, due to domestic and international climate anomalies, the market started slow, pre-inventory pressure, pesticide market in addition to some dichlorvos, endosulfan and other products due to relocation of enterprises stop production, market demand is better under the influence of tension, the vast some products, while raw materials prices because of overcapacity in the slow-moving and down the state.

 Explanation Explanation
 Abamectin comprises at least 80% avermectin B1a and not more than 20% avermectin B1b.
 Abamectin was first evaluated by the Joint Meeting in 1992, when it was allocated an ADI of 0-0.0001 mg/kg bw on the basis of the lowest NOAEL of 0.05 mg/kg bw per day for maternal toxicity observed in a study of teratogenicity in mice and a two-generation study of reproductive toxicity in rats.
 A safety factor of 500 was applied because of concern about the teratogenicity of the delta-8,9 isomer in CF-1 mice.
 The isomer is a photolytic degradation product which forms a variable part of the residue on crops.
 Abamectin was re-evaluated by the 1994 Joint Meeting in order to consider new information.
 This monograph addendum presents the data on abamectin submitted since 1992, comprising a study of the photo-oxidative stability of avermectin B1a, the main component of abamectin, and a study of the sensitivity of CD-1 mice to the toxicity of abamectin, and summarizes briefly the results of the studies described in the full monograph.
 Abamectin has a close structural relationship to ivermectin, a widely used therapeutic agent against onchocerciasis in humans, and the two compounds have similar toxic effects in various animal species.
 In 1992, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) changed the ADI for ivermectin from 0-0.0002 to 0-0.001 mg/kg bw (WHO, 1990, 1993a).
 The present Meeting therefore also considered additional data on ivermectin, comprising the results of two studies in primates and a published report of a study in humans, which were reviewed and summarized by JECFA (Dalgard et al., 1986; Hendricks & Lankas, 1986 [summarized in WHO, 1991]; Pacqui et al., 1990 [summarized in WHO, 1993b]).
 Evaluation for acceptable daily intake intake
 1.
 Biochemical aspects aspects
 Under photolytic conditions in the laboratory and in the field, abamectin undergoes isomerization around the 8,9-double bond to produce small amounts of the delta-8,9 isomer.
 A study was conducted to investigate the stability of 0.15 EC formulations of avermectin B1a and the delta-8,9 isomer by exposing thin films of the compounds to simulated solar radiation for 1-23 h.
 Slightly higher degradation rates were seen for the delta-8,9 isomer than for avermectin B1a (Demchak & MacConnell, 1986).
 (a) Absorption, distribution and excretion excretion
 Rats were given oral doses of 0.14 or 1.4 mg/kg bw per day of abamectin or 1.4 mg/kg bw per day of the delta-8,9 isomer.
 Over seven days, the percentages excreted in urine were 0.3-1% of the administered dose of abamectin and 0.4% of the dose of the isomer.
 The animals eliminated 69-82% of the dose of abamectin and 94% of the dose of isomer in faeces (Annex I, reference 67; Chiu & Lu, 1989).
 (b) Biotransformation In rats, goats and cattle, unchanged parent compound accounted for up to 50% of the total radioactive residues in tissues.
 The 24-hydroxymethyl derivative of abamectin was found in rats, goats and cattle treated with the compound and in rats treated with the delta-8,9 isomer, and the 3"-O-demethyl derivative was found in rats and cattle administered abamectin and in rats administered the isomer (Annex I, reference 67; Chiu & Lu, 1989).
 The metabolic pathways of abamectin are shown in Figure 1.

 Toxicological studies studies
 (a) Acute toxicity toxicity
 The acute toxicity of abamectin is summarized in Table 1.
 In monkeys given a single oral dose of abamectin, the NOAEL was 1 mg/kg bw per day, with a plasma concentration of 38 ng/ml, and the LOAEL was 2 mg/kg bw per day, with a plasma concentration of 76 ng/ml (Gordon et al., 1985).
 The same NOAEL and LOAEL were observed with ivermectin in monkeys (WHO, 1991).
 As shown in Table 2, abamectin induced acute effects on the central nervous system, manifested as tremors and mydriasis, particularly in dogs.
 CD-1 mice were less sensitive than rats and dogs.
 (c) Long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity carcinogenicity
 Long-term studies of toxicity in mice and rats are summarized in Table 3.
 The effects in the long-term study of abamectin in rats showed a steep dose-response relationship.
 (d) Reproductive toxicity toxicity
 Studies of the reproductive toxicity of abamectin in rodents (Annex I, reference 67) reveal that pregnant CF-1 mice are particularly sensitive to effects on the central nervous system, as tremors were observed at a dose as low as 0.16 mg/kg bw per day in a study of maternal toxicity.
 No data on mice were available for the delta-8,9 isomer.
 In rats, the NOAELs and LOELs for maternal toxicity in most of the studies were higher than in CD-1 mice, ranging from > 0.4 to 1 mg/kg bw per day.
 In one study, however, an NOAEL of 0.12 mg/kg bw per day was found on the basis of reduced mating performance at a higher dose level.
 Studies of embryo- and fetotoxicity (Annex I, reference 67) have been performed only in rats.
 The NOAELs in the different studies were 0.1-0.3 mg/kg bw per day.
 The NOAELs and LOELs in most studies were lower for embryo- and fetotoxicity than for maternal toxicity, indicating that the developing organism is particularly sensitive.
 Increased pup mortality and reduced weight gain were consistent findings after postnatal exposure.
 The delta-8,9 isomer had no adverse effects in rats at the doses tested.
 (e) Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity teratogenicity
 Studies on the embryotoxicity and teratogenicity of abamectin and the delta-8,9 isomer in rodents are summarized in Table 5.
 Mice Mice
 In pregnant CF-1 mice treated with abamectin, the NOAEL for maternal toxicity, manifested as tremors, weight loss and death, was 0.05 mg/kg bw per day, and the NOAEL for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity was 0.2 mg/kg bw per day.
 At higher doses (0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg bw per day), at which pronounced maternal toxicity occurs, an increased incidence of cleft palates was seen in comparison with concurrent control.
 The increase was not related to dose, and the incidences are within the range of those of historical controls (up to 3%) (Annex I, reference 67).
 In study 7 in Table 5, the delta-8,9 isomer was maternally toxic in CF-1 mice, inducing tremors, decreased weight gain and death, at doses above 0.1 mg/kg bw per day.
 The NOAEL for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity was > 0.03 mg/kg bw per day.
 The NOAEL for maternotoxicity was based on the finding of one moribund animal among 25 treated animals at 0.5 mg/kg bw per day.
 A marked increase in the incidence of cleft palates, which exceeded the range seen in historical controls, was observed at this maternally toxic dose.
 An increased incidence of cleft palates was seen at the NOAEL for maternal toxicity, but the value was clearly within the range of that of historical controls.
 An increased incidence of exencephaly was found at 0.03 mg/kg bw per day, which slightly exceeded the historical control range (up to 1.6%), so that the increase can be regarded as a borderline effect (Annex I, reference 67).
 The results of this study indicate that teratogenic effects occur at maternally toxic doses.
 In a second study of the delta-8,9 isomer in mice (study 8), the NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 0.1 mg/kg bw per day and that for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity was 0.05 mg/kg bw per day.
 Increased incidences of cleft palate and exencephaly were observed over those in concurrent controls at doses of 0.1 mg/kg bw per day and higher.
 Most of the anomalies were found at 0.1 mg/kg bw per day in one litter, but the range observed in historical controls was often exceeded (Annex I, reference 67).
 It is remarkable, therefore, that no dose-response relationship was seen with respect to these malformations.
 Its absence renders interpretation of these results difficult, and the conclusion that teratogenicity occurred in the absence of maternotoxicity in this study seems to be questionable.
 In a third study in mice (study 9), the NOAEL for maternal and embrotoxicity and teratogenicity was > 0.06 mg/kg bw per day (Annex I, reference 67).
 Although increased incidences of cleft palate and exencephaly were seen in comparison with concurrent controls, there was no dose-response relationship, and the incidences were within the historical control range.
 Assessment of the maternal toxicity of the delta-8,9 isomer in these three studies was difficult because of the very steep dose-response curve and the uncertainty of the end-points used (decreased body weight and slight tremors).
 From Annex I, reference 67.
 The historical control incidences of malformations in CF-1 mice (in % fetuses) were 0.3 (max.
 3) for cleft palate and 0.3 (max.
 1.6) for exencephaly.
 In Charles River rats, the incidences in historical controls were 0.03 (max.
 0.3) for cleft palate and 0.004 (max.
 0.3) for gastroschisis.
 a Cleft palate, exencephaly, gastroschisis, omphaloceles, clubbed forefeet b Statistically nonsignificant and non-dose-related increases in the rates of resorptions and of dead fetuses in all treated groups; fewer implants per female at 0.05 and 1 mg/kg bw per day Rats Rats
 In rats treated with abamectin, the NOAEL for both maternal toxicity, indicated by tremors and weight loss, and for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity was > 1.6 mg/kg bw per day.
 At 0.8 and 1.6 mg/kg bw per day, the incidence of external malformations was greater than that in concurrent controls (Annex I, reference 67); the increase was not dose-related.
 The range of incidences of each malformation in historical controls indicates that the increases seen in animals treated with abamectin were not related to treatment.
 In rats treated with the delta-8,9 isomer, no maternal or embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen at doses ranging from 0 to 1 mg/kg bw per day (Annex 1, reference 67).
 (g) Special studies studies
 Sensitivity of CF-1 mice mice
 Multidrug resistance has been associated with over-expression of permeability glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein), which is a component of the plasma membrane in various cell types and species (Beck, 1997; Gottesman & Pastan, 1993).
 Cells that express high levels of P-glycoprotein have decreased rates of drug uptake, decreased steady-state levels of drugs and decreased drug retention (Beck et al., 1983).
 Schinkel et al.
 (1994) used mice that had been genetically engineered for disruption of the gene that encodes P-glycoprotein and showed that ivermectin is a substrate for this protein.
 In a short-term study of oral toxicity, comparisons were made of the sensitivity of CF-1 and CD-1 mice to abamectin and their levels of P-glycoprotein, in order to determine whether low levels of the protein could explain the particularly high sensitivity of CD-1 mice to abamectin.
 Abamectin was administered orally in sesame oil to groups of 49 male and 50 female CF-1 mice and five male and five female CD-1 mice at 0.8 mg/kg bw per day for five days.
 A control group received only the vehicle.
 The LD50 for abamectin given orally is about 10 mg/kg bw for CF-1 mice and higher for CD-1 mice.
 Signs of severe neurotoxicity appeared in 12 female and five male CF-1 mice 3-4 h after the first dose; no clinical signs of toxicity were seen in any of the other CF-1 mice or in any of the CD-1 or control mice.
 Immunohistochemical investigation of the cerebellum, cerebral cortex and jejunum showed that the abamectin-sensitive CF-1 mice had low levels of P-glycoprotein and the abamectin-insensitive CF-1 mice had higher levels, which were similar to those seen in CD-1 mice (Lankas et al., 1994).
 These results indicate that about 17% of CF-1 mice are highly sensitive to abamectin and that there is a strong correlation between the P-glycoprotein level and sensitivity to abamectin.
 Comments Comments
 In a study of photo-oxidative stability, the half-life of the delta-8,9 isomer was 4.5 and that of avermectin B1a was 6.5 h.
  A study in which expression of the P-glycoprotein (a permeability protein associated with multiple drug resistance) was correlated with sensitivity to avermectins in different mouse strains was also considered.
 A two-week study of the oral toxicity of ivermectin conducted in immature rhesus monkeys at doses of 0, 0.3, 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg bw per day showed no adverse effects on body weight, clinical signs, ophthalmoscopic end-points, haematological, or clinical chemical parameters, or pathological manifestations.
 Thus, the NOAEL in this study was > 1.2 mg/kg bw per day.
 In a second two-week study with ivermectin, in which neonatal rhesus monkeys were administered doses of 0, 0.04 or 0.1 mg/kg bw per day by nasogastric intubation, the NOAEL was 0.1 mg/kg bw per day.
 The doses administered were 10-30 times the dose that would be received by the nursing infant of a lactating mother who had been treated with ivermectin for onchocerciasis.
 New data were submitted which showed that the high sensitivity of the CF-1 mouse to the toxicity of avermectins on the nervous system is associated with a deficiency in the expression of P-glycoprotein in both the epithelium of the small intestine and the capillary endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier.
 The deficiency is associated with a marked increase in the concentration of ivermectin in the brain and plasma after administration of the compound.
 CD-1 mice and those of the CF-1 strain that have higher levels of P-glycoprotein are less sensitive to the toxicity of abamectin on the central nervous system than the approximately 17% of CF-1 mice deficient in this protein.
 The oral LD50 for CF-1 P-glycoprotein-deficient mice was about one order of magnitude lower than that of CD-1 mice and of CF-1 mice with higher levels of P-glycoprotein.
 This heterogeneity in the CF-1 mouse strain may explain the apparent absence of a dose-response relationship with respect to maternal toxicity in the studies of teratogenicity.
 These data cannot, however, be used to demonstrate a correlation between P-glycoprotein deficiency and teratogenicity, although, given the apparent absence of a dose-response relationship, such a correlation might be inferred.
 Extensive information available on the use of ivermectin in animal and human health was reviewed at the fortieth meeting of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 1992.
 That Committee concluded that 'despite the extremely wide use of ivermectin, there is no evidence of significant incidences of adverse effects on reproductive performance in treated animals and the very limited data on reproductive toxicity in humans indicate that ivermectin does not increase the incidence of birth defects.
 The Meeting confirmed that the lowest NOAEL was 0.05 mg/kg bw per day for maternal toxicity in the studies of teratogenicity in mice for abamectin and for the delta-8,9 isomer.
 The Joint Meeting in 1992 considered that slight decreases in body-weight gain early in the lactation period in one generation of rats in a study of reproductive toxicity provided supporting evidence.
 The present Meeting concluded that the NOAEL in the study on reproductive toxicity in rats was 0.12 mg/kg bw per day on the basis of toxicity to pups at the higher dose level.
 The Meeting concluded that the CF-1 mouse strain is heterogeneous with respect to sensitivity to abamectin and, therefore, may be an inappropriate model for studying the toxicity (including teratogenicity) of avermectins.
 The Meeting therefore decided to base the ADI on the NOAEL of 0.12 mg/kg bw per day for pup toxicity in the study of reproductive toxicity in rats.
 A safety factor of 500 was applied because the concern about the teratogenicity of the delta-8,9 isomer could not be assuaged by the additional data.

 Avermectin is a new antibiotic used for agriculture and animals.
 It has high bioactivity on mites and pests of many crops.
 It is also an ideal antibiotic insecticide and acaricide.
 It is broad-spectrum, highly effective, low residual and safe for people, animals and environment.
 In the first half of 2009, the prices of Chinese avermectin products continued to rise.
 Compared with the beginning of 2009, the price growth rate at the end of June rose by 50%.
 The sales status of avermectin products was much better compared with many other insecticide products.
 The main reasons for the price growth in Chinese market in the first half of 2009 are as follows:
 1.
 After the prohibition of 5 hypertoxic pesticides, avermectin began to develop rapidly and its dosages were increased gradually.
 It had become a common pesticide in China.
 2.
 Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) producers adjusted the prices according to market supplies and demands.
 But the current production capacity of avermectin didn�t increase significantly.
 3.
 In 2009, the pesticide preparation producers had large demands for avermectin APIs.
 The purchase quantity of avermectin APIs in 2009 was several times that of the previous years, increasing the price of avermectin stock solution.
 4th Encourage the marketing of rice, cotton and other crops this year, many manufacturers in the preparation of avermectin rice leaf roller, a cruciferous Diamondback moths, caterpillars, cotton boll worms, and asparagus, and so on, n & # xF5; udmisi avermectin.
 Thus, the price rose obviously avermectin.
 Though Chinese avermectin products performed outstandingly on both supply and marketing in the first half of 2009, it is estimated that the price growth rate in the latter half year will drop as the price has grown too fast.
 Due to the unsuitable usage of avermectins by farmers, pests have significantly strengthened their resistance capacities against avermectin products, which would speed up the development and promotion of substitutes.
 Therefore, the avermectin pesticide industry will face both opportunities and challenges in the next few years.

 Abamectin is a delayed-action insecticide, allowing for greater overall colony control.
 The active ingredient Abamectin, found in many popular pesticides including Advance 375A Select Granular Ant Bait and Advance Carpenter Ant Bait, is a mixture of nerve poisons known as avermectins.
 These poisons work to control ant and insect populations by affecting the central nervous system and causing insect paralysis, which leads to death.
 However, abamectin is a delayed-action insecticide, so it does not kill immediately.
 The benefit of delayed-action insecticides as compared to those that kill instantly is that the poisoned insect is allowed time to travel back to the colony and spread the poison to other insects either through contact or food sharing (ingestion).
 Environment Friendly Friendly
 Abamectin is classified as a General Use Pesticide (GUP), meaning that it is unlikely to harm the environment as long as you follow the directions on the label.
 Anyone can safely use a GUP, not just the pros.
 Abamectin is also classified as a class IV toxin on a scale of I to IV, where I is highly toxic and IV is practically nontoxic.
 To maximize the use of ant baits containing abamectin, use with a gel bait such as Maxforce Carpenter Ant Bait Gel or a liquid bait such as Termidor SC.

 Bioremediation of Xenobiotics Xenobiotics
 Use of pesticides has benefited the modem society by improving the quantity and quality of the worlds' food production.
 Gradually, pesticide usage has become an integral part of modern agriculture system.
 Many of the artificially made complex compounds i.e.
 xenobiotics persist in environment and do not undergo biological transformation.
 Microorganisms play an important role in degradation of xenobiotics, and maintaining of steady state concentrations of chemicals in the environment.
 The complete degradation of a pesticide molecule to its inorganic components that can be eventually used in an oxidative cycle removes its potential toxicity from the environment.
 However, there are two objectives in relation to biodegradation of xenobiotics:
 (i) how biodegradation activity arises, evolves and transferred among the members of soil microflora, and (ii) to device bioremediation methods for removing or detoxifying high concentration of dangerous pesticide residues (Gupta and Mukerji, 1998).
 The characters of pesticide degradation of microorganisms are located on plasmids and transposons, and are grouped in clusters on chromosome.
 Understanding of the characters provides clues to the evolution of degradative pathways and makes the task of gene manipulation easier to construct the genetically engineered microbes capable of degrading the pollutants.
 Microbial Degradation of Xenobiotics Xenobiotics
 Biodegradation of pesticides occurs by aerobic soil microbes.
 Pesticides are of wide varieties of chemicals e.g.
 chlorophenoxyalkyl caboxylic acid, substituted ureas, nitrophenols, tri-azines, phenyl carbamates, orga-nochlorines, organophosphates, etc.
 Duration of persistence of her�bicides and insecticides in soil is given in Table 21.2.
 Otganophos-phates (e.g.
 diazion, methyl par-athion and parathion) are perhaps the most extensively used insecti�cides under many agricultural sys�tems.
 Biodegradation through hy�drolysis of p-o-aryl bonds by Pseudomonas diminuta and Flavobacterium are considered as the most significant steps in the detoxification of organophospho-rus compounds.
 Organomercurials (e.g.
 Semesan, Panodrench, Panogen) have been practiced in agriculture since the birth of fun�gicides.
 Several species of Aspergillus, Penicillium and Trichoderma have been isolated from Semesan-treated soil.
 More�over, they have shown ability to grow over 100 ppm of fungicide in vitro.
 The major fungicides used in agriculture are water soluble derivatives such as Ziram, Ferbam, Thiram, etc.
 All these are de�graded by microorganisms.

 Outline of aerobic and anaerobic degradation of pentachlorophenol.
 Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a broad spectrum biocide which has been used as fungicide, insecticide, herbicide, algicide, disinfectant and antifouling agent.
 Bioreactors containing alginate immobilized + Polyurethane foam immobilized PCP degrading Flavobacterium (ATCC39723) cells have been used to remove PCP from contaminated water.
 Absorption of PCP by Polyurethane immobilized matrix plays a role in reducing the toxicity of PCP.
 Flavobacterium re�moved and detoxified PCP (Zhong -Cheng, 1994).
 In other experiment P.
 chrysosporium enzyme (ligninase) has been found to dehalogenate PCP.
 Steps of PCP degradation has been shown in Fig.

 DDT (l,l,l-trichlofo-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethane) is an insecticide that persists in soil for four years.
 Degradation pathway of DDT involves an initial dechlorination of the trichloromethyl group to form 1,1-dichloro 2-ethane which then undergoes further dechlorination, oxidation and decarboxylation to form bis methane.
 Subsequent cleavage of one of the normal aromatic rings yields p-chlorophenyl acetic acid, which may also undergo ring cleavage.
 Microorganisms associated with DDT degradation are Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxysporum, Mucor aternans, P.
 chrysosporium, Trichoderma viride, etc.
 Environmental factors including pH, temperature, bioavailability, nutrient supply and oxygen availability affect biodegradation of pesticides.
 Gene Manipulation of Pesticide-degrading Microorganisms Microorganisms
 Day-by-day the number of xenobiotic-degrading microorganisms is increasing.
 However, pesticide-degrading genes of only a few microorganisms have been characterized.
 Most of genes responsible for catabolic degradation are located on the chromosomes, but in a few cases these genes are found on plasmids or transposons.
 Chakrabarty and Gunsalus (1971) found that camphor degrading genes of Pseudomonas putida are located on plasmid.
 Soon after, naphthalene (NAH) degrading plasmid was isolated.
 Discovery of these genes made it possible to construct a new genetically engineered strain of P.
 putida that alone was potent to degrade camphor, naphthalene, xylene, toluene, octanes and hexanes.
 For detailed discussion, see Abatement of pollution.
 For the first time pesticide degradation through plasmid mediated genetically engineered microorganism was reported by Chakrabarty et al (1981).
 Nagata et al (1993) have also cloned and sequenced two genes involved in early steps of Y-HCH degradation in UT26.
 The linAgene encodes Y-HCH dehydrochlorinase which converts Y-HCH to 1,2,4TCB via Y-PCCH and 1,4-TCDN.
 The linBgene encodes 1,4-TCDN chlorohydrolase which converts 1,4-TCDN to 2,4-DDOL via 2,4,5-DNOL.
 This gene is a member of the haloalkanedehalogenase family with a broad range specificity for substrate.
 The genetically engineered P.
 putida comprises of both linA and linB genes (Nagata et al, 1993).
 The pod gene, initially isolated from Flavobacterium sp.
 ATCC27551 and Pseudomonas diminuta, has been well characterized.
 It is associated for degradation of pesticides such as parathion, methylparathion, etc.
 Sims et al (1990) transferred a recombinant DNA plasmid containing pod gene into a fungus, Gliocladium virens which expressed at low level.
 G.
 virens is a useful soil saprophyte which has shown a strong mycoparasitic activity against many fungal pathogens.
 Strains of G.
 virens are potential for use in the bioremediation of contaminated soil.
 Optimization of pod expression in bioremedially useful organism such as P.

 virens, etc.
 holds a great promise in lessening the pesticide pollution.
 In recent years, attention has focused on suppression of immunity in immunocompromised patients.
 The definition of immunocompromise is impairment of the immune system caused by a disease or treatment.
 In addition to disease and treatment, other factors such as exposure to pesticides or toxic chemicals can damage the immune system.
 An in vitro test was used to assess the ability of monochloroacetic acid (MCA) (CAS number 79-11-8), dichloroacetic acid (DCA) (CAS number 79-43-6), trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (CAS number 76-03-9), and 2,2- dichloropropionic acid sodium salt (2,2-DCPANa, Dalapon) (CAS number 127-20-8) to suppress bacteriolysis by hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL).
 The system for bacteriolysis of Gram-negative bacteria Actinobacillus, Haemophilus, and Pasteurella in Tris-maleate buffer supplemented with EDTA and HEWL developed by Brondz et al.
 [1�4] was used to monitor bacteriolysis of Gram-negative bacteria in the Actinobacillus�Haemophilus�Pasteurella group.
 The halogenated acetic acid DCA is produced as a toxic artifact of the degradation of TCA and by disinfection of drinking and pool water and industrial waste.
 Nearly all humans consume DCA in drinking water during their lifetime; the concentration of DCA in drinking water can be higher than that associated with the upper-bound excess life-time cancer risk of 10�4 (40�g/L) [5].
 Lysozyme found in tears, saliva, nasal secretions, and excretions from all mucous membranes can break down the cell walls of bacteria and destabilize bacterial membranes.
 Lysozyme is involved in innate (nonspecific) immunity; the innate immune system is the first line of defense against invading organisms.
 Actinobacillus actinomy- cetemcomitans (ATCC29522), a Gram-negative bacterium whose primary ecological niche is the respiratory tract and oral cavity, provided the peptidoglycan substrate for HEWL.
 The optical density (OD) of a standardized suspension of A.
 actinomycetemcomitans decreased from 100% (OD 0.6 at 540 nm) to 23.5% after exposure to EDTA/HEWL for 50 min.
 After 50 min of exposure to 10.0 mg/mL of MCA, DCA, TCA, or 2,2-DCPANa as a supplement, EDTA/HEWL-induced lysis of A.
 actinomycetemcomitans decreased to 66.3%, 66.8%, 65.7%, and 73.6%, respectively.
 The aim of the presented study was the development of a model for measuring possible immunotoxic effects of chemicals, degradation products, xenobiotics and metabolites by these chemicals on the immune system.
 The method used is an in vitro bacteriolysis of Gram- negative bacterium induced by HEWL, described previously [1-4].
 In the present study, several halogenated acids, MCA, DCA, and TCA, and the Na salt of 2,2-DCPA, exhibited immunosuppressive activity.
 The ability of MCA, DCA, TCA, and 2,2-DCPANa (Dalapon) to suppress HEWL induced bacteriolysis was demonstrated in vitro.

 A great deal of uncertainty exists regarding the extent to which humans and wildlife are exposed to chemical stressors in aquatic resources.
 Scientific literature is replete with studies of xenobiotics in surface waters, including a recent national USGS survey of endocrine disrupting chemicals; however, biological significance of these chemical data is in question since chemical bioavailability is largely unknown and biological events may be induced by undetected chemicals and varying ecological conditions (i.e., total nitrogen and phosphorus).
 Whole effluent toxicity data exist, but do not answer specific exposure questions that may support detailed ecological risk assessments.
 Interpretation of data arising from exposure to complex chemical mixtures is even more problematic.
 A solution to these problems is development of sensitive and specific cellular indicators of exposure in aquatic organisms.
 The potential for development is enhanced by emergent resources in molecular biology and associated technologies, most notably DNA microarrays consisting of transcriptionally relevant nucleic acid sequences that can be used to detect altered gene expression in cells, tissues and various life stages of organisms exposed to chemical and natural stressors.
 Ecological investigation in the present Task have been partitioned into three focal research areas:
 Core Computational Toxicology research research
 Ecological research research
 Molecular Diagnostics and endocrine disrupting compounds.
 Three areas of core and applied research will be consequential on development of molecular indicators diagnostic for exposure to specific xenobiotic, natural stressors, and complex mixtures thereof, in freshwater fish and invertebrates.
 Research is focused on Agency's long-established aquatic toxicological organism, the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas).
 Although numerous molecular biological approaches are exploited, foremost methods leading to development of molecular indicators are assembly and manufacture of DNA microarrays containing transcriptionally relevant gene sequences of fathead minnow, and the detection of novel or differentially expressed proteins by means of 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry.
 An extensive effort in "gene discovery� research with the fathead minnow has been the primary emphasis of respective research areas, since high-throughput genome sequencing efforts-such as those in human and mouse-have not been directed toward organisms used in aquatic toxicity testing such as fathead minnows.
 Gene discovery research is fundamental to identified research areas, and is expected to be augmented by high-throughput cDNA sequencing data arising through a collaborative effort with the Dept.
 of Energy, Joint Genome Institute.
 Also, proteins induced to differential expression by chemical exposure will be used in "reverse genetics� approach wherein knowledge of protein sequence will make possible the investigation of gene function and associated mechanistic biology.
 Objective:
 Following development and validation, fathead minnow microarrays, along with critical indicators identified by expression proteomics, will enable extensive molecular profiling studies, the hypotheses of which are that unique patterns of gene expression will be detected in targeted tissues of fathead minnows exposed to individual chemical stressors.
 Identification of unique, differentially expressed genes will then provide the basis for stressor-specific, quantitative molecular indicators, theory and methods that can be readily transferred to investigators within USEPA Regions, Tribes and states.
 Ultimately, proposed research will provide environmental science and risk assessment communities with advanced molecular biological indicator methods, complete with validation studies and guidance for their application.
 Early success has been achieved in the transfer of molecular indicator technologies to USEPA Region 9 and State of California.

 The word, xenobiotic, is a combination of two different roots, �xeno� and �biotic.� Xeno is from the Greek and means strange, unnatural, or different.
 Biotic is a word that implies life.
 Xenobiotic, therefore, refers to an organic compound that mimics natural biochemicals that are essential for life, but which have characteristics about them that are strange and unnatural.
 Xenobiotics are often toxic to life.
 Also, they may not be recognized by biochemical processes in plants and microorganisms and are thus resistant to degradation in the environment.
 Xenobiotics include many compounds that are involved in both industrial and agricultural activities.
 The fate of industrial solvents and other industrial chemicals in the soil environment is an important domain of soil biochemistry.
 Research is desperately needed to determine the biochemical reactions in soil that transform these xenobiotic compounds to their mineral components.
 Synthetic organic pesticides are xenobiotics that are commonly used in agriculture and are added to the soil in large amounts each year.
 Chemicals with pesticide activity were designed rimarily to control insect, weed, fungal or nematode pests.
 In 1939, DDT (dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane) was discovered by a chemist named Paul Herman Mueller.
 Mueller was awarded a Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine in 1948 for his discovery.
 Increased use of pesticides began during the 1950s and has continued to the present time.
 Since that time, more than 600 different chemical pesticides have been tested and registered for use in the United States.
 The fates of xenobiotics in soil include (i) complete mineralization or (ii) stabilization of the parent compound, or some metabolite of the compound, in soil.
 If the xenobiotics are toxic and the rate of degradation is very slow, adverse effects on human and on ecological health are possible.
 Therefore it is desirable to maintain xenobiotic concentrations in soil at as low a level as possible.
 Because of these concerns, considerable research effort has been spent in trying to understand the metabolic degradation pathways of xenobiotics in soil.
 The remainder of the introductory remarks to this chapter will pertain to pesticide reactions in soil, although many of the comments would also apply to other classes of xenobiotics.
 Effect of Pesticides on Soil Processes.
 Evaluations of the effects of pesticides on soil processes have often yielded conflicting results.
 This is because the toxicity of pesticides varies and other soil factors interact with the pesticide to influence its activity.
 Tests conducted in the laboratory with pure microbial cultures and growth media provides data that, generally, cannot be ecologically interpreted.
 Contrary to model laboratory systems, pesticides in soil may be sorbed onto colloids, degraded rapidly, or exist in widely varying concentrations at different microsites within the soil.
 Also a wide diversity of different microorganisms in soil and the interaction between them cannot be predicted when pure cultures are used for study.
 A common technique of evaluating the fate of a pesticide in soil is to add the pesticide directly to the soil and measure the CO2 that is evolved.
 Pesticide additions to soil are also made to determine the pesticide�s effect on other soil processes such as nitrification, phosphorus mineralization, denitrification, etc.
 Microbiological changes due to pesticide addition may be determined by measuring total counts, enumeration of individual species, presence of absence of a wide number of different species (i.e.
 species diversity), or change in biological function.
 A process in soil that is very sensitive to the presence of certain pesticides is nitrification.
 This seems to be due to the narrow range of microbial species that carry out this transformation.
 Several pathogenic microorganisms are also sensitive to certain pesticides.
 Addition of fungicides to soils, for example, may effectively control plant disease due to the destruction of the pathogenic fungi.
 In addition, however, other beneficial fungal species may also be killed.
 For most soil processes, addition of pesticides to soil causes only a small, temporary drop in activity.
 The addition of a pesticide to soil may, in some cases, bring about selective pressure for those microorganisms capable of degrading the pesticide.
 Or, the pesticide may stimulate the production of extracellular enzymes that are capable of detoxifying the pesticide molecule.
 The phenomenon in which a pesticide degrades so rapidly in soil that it no longer performs its intended function of pest control is called enhanced biodegradation or accelerated degradation.
 An understanding of the soil, biochemical, and microbial factors and the interactions involved that bring about enhanced biodegradation is lacking.
 Application to an agricultural field of a pesticide that fails to perform as expected can result in large financial losses.
 On the other hand, if the process of enhanced biodegradation were clearly understood, it could be applied to cases where compounds must be rapidly reduced in their detrimental effect.
 The persistence of a pesticide in soil causes different types of problems.
 If the pesticide remains in soil for a long period of time it may (i) be assimilated by plants and accumulate in edible portions, (ii) be transported with eroding soil particles or with surface and subsurface waters to locations where its presence may cause harm or (iii) it may accumulate in the animal food chain and change the ecological balance of nature.
 Compounds that are short-lived in the environment are less likely to achieve these fates.
 Metabolism of Pesticides in Soil.
 Metabolism of pesticides in soil may be classified into two main categories.
 The first category is defined by the ability of the chemical to support microbial growth by supplying nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen, as well as supplying a source of energy.
 The presence of the pesticide will cause a rise in numbers of the microbial subpopulation that can utilize the chemical while at the same time bringing about the disappearance of the pesticide from the soil.
 Microorganisms of this type can be isolated from soil through enrichment techniques.
 The second category of metabolic processes is called cometabolism.
 The pesticide is degraded but does not serve as a source of energy or nutrients.
 Heterotrophs of this sort cannot be isolated by enrichment culture techniques.
 Martin Alexander has outlined six different classes of reactions that result in partial or total transformation of a pesticide molecule.
 Detoxification is the conversion of an inhibitory molecule to a nontoxic product.
 Complete mineralization is the extreme case of detoxification.
 However, more common is the removal of a functional group from the pesticide molecule.
 Degradation is the transformation of a complex substrate molecule to simple products and is often considered synonymous with mineralization.
 A reaction that results in making the pesticide more complex by combining with itself or other soil compounds is called conjugation, complex formation, or addition reactions.
 Oxidative coupling is an example of this class of reactions.
 Activation is the conversion of a nontoxic substrate or a pesticide precursor to a toxic molecule.
 For example the insecticide phorate is transformed in soil to give metabolites that are also toxic to insects.
 A changing of the spectrum of toxicity is another reaction in which pesticides may participate.
 Some pesticides may be toxic to one group of organisms but may be metabolized to become toxic to completely different group of, and possibly nontarget, organisms.
 Metabolic pathways of pesticide degradation have been established in the laboratory in model systems involving pure cultures for a large number of pesticides.
 These "type reactions" are very useful in making educated guesses about the types of compounds that may be formed in soil during the degradation of a specific pesticide molecule.
 However, the type reactions do not allow us to make predictions about which step is the rate-limiting step in the overall degradation process, and thus, which metabolic products may accumulate in the soil.
 Yet in view of the large number of chemicals that eventually reach the soil and the inability to test each one rapidly and thoroughly, the ability to predict the metabolic fates and products by applying type reactions to the chemical of interest has utility.
 The rate at which a pesticide degrades in soil is subject to a number of variables.
 Five conditions have been outlined which must be met before a pesticide molecule may be degraded.
 These conditions include:
 1.
 an organism effective in metabolizing a pesticide molecule must live or be capable of living in the soil, soil,
 2.
 the compound must be in a chemical and physical form suitable for degradation, degradation,
 3.
 the chemical must be located in the same environment as the active agent, e.g.
 a microbial cell or an extracellular enzyme, of degradation, degradation,
 4.
 the compound must be capable of inducing formation of the enzymes or enzymes appropriate for detoxification - low solubility or low concentration of the pesticide and low uptake into the microbial cell may result in lack of induction, and and
 5.
 environmental conditions such as pH, temperature, and organic matter must be suitable for the degrading microorganisms to proliferate and the enzyme to operate.
 If any of these conditions are not met, the pesticide will not readily be decomposed and may persist in the soil environment for long periods of time.
 The factors that control the rate of degradation of pesticides in soil are characteristic of the soil, microorganism, and the pesticide molecule.
 An understanding of the direct and indirect effect of all three factors must exist before accurate assessments of the ecological impact of pesticides in the soil can be made.
 A model is described that accounts for the effect of physical properties on the mobility of a xenobiotic within the phloem tissue of a plant.
 This model builds on the intermediate permeability hypothesis by incorporating the effect of acid dissociation.
 The relative importance of lipophilicity and acid-base properties of compounds is discussed.
 The sensitivity of the model predictions to plant parameters such as the nature of the sieve tube membranes is also explored.
 Experimental support for the model is presented using examples from the literature.
 The systematic behaviour of mobility as a function of physical properties for both non-ionized and acidic compounds is well accounted for by the model with only rare exceptions.
 Application of the model to commercial plant-protection chemicals is generally consistent with experimental observations.
 Thus, many of the herbicides that are known to be phloem-mobile are predicted to be so by the model.
 However, none of the selected fungicides and only a few of the insecticides are predicted to be phloem-systemic, again in general agreement with observation.

 Estrogenic pesticides such as DDT and chlordecone generate deleterious reproductive effects.
 An "in culture" bioassay was used to assess the estrogenicity of several pesticides.
 The E-screen test uses human breast estrogen-sensitive MCF7 cells and compares the cell yield achieved after 6 days of culture in medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-dextran stripped human serum in the presence (positive control) or absence (negative control) of estradiol and with estrogenic properties comparable to those of DDT and chlordecone; the latter are known to be estrogenic in rodent models.
 The E-screen test also revealed that estrogenic chemicals may act cumulatively; when mixed together they induce estrogenic responses at concentrations lower than those required when each compound is administered alone.

 Abstract Abstract
 Background:
 To explore associations with prostate cancer and farming, it is important to investigate the relationship between pesticide use and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in xenobiotic metabolic enzyme (XME) genes.
 Obective:
 We evaluated pesticide�SNP interactions between 45 pesticides and 1913 XME SNPs with respect to prostrate cancer among 776 cases and 1444 controls in the Agricultural Health Study.
 Methods:
 We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
 Multiplicative SNP�pesticide interactions were calculated using a likelihood ratio test.
 Results:
 A positive monotonic interaction was observed between petroleum oil/petroleum distillate use and rs1883633 in the oxidative stress gene glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC; P interaction=1.0�10-4); men carrying at least one variant allele (minor allele) experienced an increased prostate cancer risk (OR=3.7, 95% CI:
 1.9�7.3).
 Among men carrying the variant allele for thioredoxin reductase 2 (TXNRD2) rs4485648, microsomal epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1) rs17309872, or myeloperoxidase (MPO) rs11079344, an increased prostate cancer risk was observed with high, compared with no, petroleum oil/petroleum distillate (OR=1.9, 95% CI:
 1.1�3.2, P interaction=0.01; OR=2.1, 95% CI:
 1.1�4.0, P interaction=0.01), or terbufos (OR=3.0, 95% CI:
 1.5�6.0, P interaction=2.0�10-3) use, respectively.
 No interactions were deemed noteworthy at the false discovery rate=0.20 level; the number of observed interactions in XMEs was comparable with the number expected by chance alone.
 Conclusion:
 We observed several pesticide�SNP interactions in oxidative stress and phase I/II enzyme genes and risk of prostate cancer.
 Additional work is needed to explain the joint contribution of genetic variation in XMEs, pesticide use, and prostate cancer risk.
 Comparative evaluation of the acute effects of ethylenebisdithiocarbamate (EBDC) fungicides, mancozeb and zineb on microsomal mixed function oxidases (MFO) revealed marked substrate-dependent inhibition of oxidative metabolism of aminopyrine, p-nitroanisole and aniline in rats sacrificed 4 hr after oral administration of 100 mg mancozeb or zineb/kg body weight.
 Mancozeb inhibited p-nitroanisole O-dealkylase and aniline hydroxylase to a greater degree than zineb, whereas the inhibition of aminopyrine N-demethylase by the two fungicides was quantitatively comparable.
 Interestingly, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) which exhibited maximum inhibition with mancozeb, remained unaffected following zineb administration.
 The time-course and dose-dependence of MFO inhibition examined 1 and 4 hr after a single oral dose of 100 mg or 250 mg zineb/kg was expressed as a dose-dependent decline in the rate of xenobiotic biotransformation at 4 hr.
 In vitro interaction of zineb with MFO resulted in slightly greater inhibition of aminopyrine, p-nitroanisole and aniline while AHH exhibited more pronounced decrease with mancozeb.
 The magnitude of inhibition of aminopyrine N-demethylase and AHH was independent of the time of preincubation of fungicides with the enzyme.
 Kinetic studies indicated the non-competitive nature of AHH inhibition.
 Chronic oral treatment with mancozeb and zineb at a dose of 250 mg/kg for 4 weeks did not modify xenobiotic biotransformations except for a slight induction of aminopyrine N-demethylase by mancozeb.
 Contamination of ground or surface waters and soils with pesticides (xenobiotics) may be caused by direct intentional application (e.g.
 control of aquatic weeds or insects) by discharge of industrial wastewater or spray liquid remainders, by the incidental contamination of a surface source, or by percolation or leaching out by rain from treated agricultural land.
 Pesticide contamination of water should be prevented as far as possible, both because of direct toxicity to man, and because of the influence on water biocenosis and possible accumulation in the food chain.
 For this reason extensive measures and preventive lowering of pesticide levels for catchment areas (the area drained by a river or body of water), water supply streams and underground water sources are to be recommended.
 In spite of existing protective measures, low level contamination of drinking water sources is frequently observed.
 Very low concentrations of some pesticides cause organoleptic changes in the water, making it unacceptable to the consumer irrespective of any known toxic effects.
 Beyond that, many pesticide molecules or their degradation products are very toxic to non-target organisms (fish, aquatic invertebrates and phytoplankton) and may have carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, immuno-modulating and endocrine disrupting properties.
 Pesticides also affect the soils:
 reduces biodiversity and results in lower soil quality, reduced nitrogen fixation and organic material mineralization.
 Pesticide residues in the soil are taken up by plants and get into humans consuming the crops directly or through the food chain, so quick microbiological degradation of pesticide residues in soil is very important due to lowering their level in order to protect human health and enable the organic farming.
 The pesticide ingredients with high risk factors are:
 - 2,4-D (herbicide) (herbicide)
 - diuron (herbicide) (herbicide)
 - carbendazim (systemic fungicide) fungicide)
 - mancozeb (contact fungicide) fungicide)
 2,4-D, Diuron and carbendazim are endocrine disruptors and have a persistent character.
 Degradation of mancozeb results in a potent mutagenic persistent compound, ethylene-thiourea (ETU).
 From diuron a mutagenic and persistent compound, 3,4-dichloraniline; from carbendazim 2-aminobenzimidazole and from 2,4-D 2,4-dichlorophenol are produced by soil microorganisms.
 These degradation products have higher water solubility than the original molecule, and can leach from treated agricultural land into surface waters.
 Diuron is highly toxic to aquatic invertebrates and algae.
 Accelerated, complete degradation of these xenobiotics in surface waters and in agricultural soils would be highly desirable.
 Objectives of the project project
 to isolate and identify pesticide degrading bacteria and develop optimized, harmonically working bacterial mixtures which are capable of quick and complete degradation of the pesticides carbendazim, 2,4-D, diuron and mancozeb.
 To apply the identified bacterial mixtures in field experiments experiments
 - to develop rapid sample preparation methods, capable for highly sensitive and multi-residues sample analysis with the challenge to come up with techniques that have the advantages such as automation, time and labor saving, high throughput, and the use of smaller sample volumes, resulting in improved reproducibility, accuracy, and sensitivity sensitivity
 - to develop optimized methods for pesticide analysis employing UPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry spectrometry
 - to identify the xenobiotic degradation kinetics and products and their toxicological effect effect
 - to improve soil and water quality on the decontaminated site in order to restore biodiversity in soil and water, enhancing N-fixation and mineralization in soil, making organic farming possible on the decontaminated areas areas
 Expected outputs, results; project impact impact
 - Development of bioaugmentation products will contribute to the knowledge on science based application of new, environment friendly agricultural technologies on both sides of the border border
 - Development of optimized methods for pesticide analysis employing UPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometry hence establishing a cross-border innovation network network
 - Joint research will establish and strengthen a sustainable partnership between the research groups and between the two Departments and Universities and will support researchers' and students' mobility and make future research activities possible within EU FP calls calls
 - Joint dissemination and promotional activities will ensure increased visibility of TFNS and SZTE and their activities within the EU EU
 - Raising public awareness about the use of environment friendly technologies and contributing to environmental sustainability and safety in the cross-border region region
 - Improvement of soil and water quality on the decontaminated site.
 Restoration of biodiversity in soil and water, enhanced N fixation and mineralization in soil.
 Thus, the organic farming will be made possible on the decontaminated areas, hence enabling competitiveness of the cross-border region in the enlarged EC in terms of production according to European quality standards.
 Organic farming would rank the cross-border region within the safe regions for food production in EU hence enabling positive financial effects effects
 Nitroaromatic compounds have a range of uses including applications as pesticides and explosives.
 Certain nitroaromatics are common contaminants in soil and water due to their recalcitrance and wide use.
 Bacteria, fungi, and plants possess a wide array of enzymatic processes involved in transformation of these compounds.
 Bacterial oxidative mechanisms include:
 flavin monooxygenase mediated-nitrite release from p-nitrophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, dinitrocresol, and dioxygenase-mediated nitrite release from 2,6-dinitrophenol and nitrotoluene.
 Aromatic nitroreductases are ubiquitous among bacteria, certain fungi and plants.
 Oxidative pathways facilitate extensive degradation of nitroaromatics, however enzymes in these pathways typically have a more specific substrate range than nitroreductases.
 Elimination of reduced nitro groups by partial nitroreductive processes aids in subsequent metabolism of these molecules.
 Reductive catabolic pathways for 2,4-dinitrophenol and picric acid involve initial hydrogenation reactions.
 Specific plant transformations include:
 glutathione S-transferase-mediated nitrite release, nitroreductase, and ferredoxin-NADP oxidoreductase-mediated nitrite liberation.
 The biochemistry, physiology, and ecology of nitroaromatic metabolism are reviewed, emphasizing systems for xenobiotic detoxification.
 All biological organisms have defense mechanisms to protect them from the negative effects of small quantities of foreign compounds (xenobiotics).
 These foreign compounds in plants include pesticides.
 Herbicides are a type of pesticide toxic to plants specifically, because they inhibit metabolic pathways unique to plants (e.g.
 photosynthesis).
 Herbicides are used successfully in weed management systems because they selectively harm sensitive weeds while leaving crops undamaged.
 Many factors contribute to successful herbicide action (e.g.
 successful placement or absorption and movement to target sites); however, the major reason herbicides are selective against weeds in crops is because crop plants are able to metabolize the herbicide to a non-toxic form.
 The basis for herbicide selectivity relies on enzymatic systems used in the plant�s normal metabolic processes.
 The relative rates of herbicide absorption, translocation, and metabolism usually determine whether or not a herbicide will elicit a phytotoxic response.
 To better understand how these processes may each influence herbicidal action, they should be considered separately.
 Absorption has primary control over translocation, metabolism and phytotoxic action because the total amount of herbicide available for these processes is determined by the amount of herbicide absorbed by the plant.
 Metabolism influences both herbicide absorption and phytotoxic action.
 Metabolism generally converts the herbicide to a form with reduced phytotoxicity, thus, increasing the concentration gradient of the parent herbicide, so more is absorbed.
 Herbicide metabolism also influences phytotoxic action by either rendering the herbicide less or more active.
 GENERAL VIEW OF THE MAJOR PHASES IN HERBICIDE METABOLISM - -
 Plants use a three-phase process to convert xenobiotics, such as herbicides or insecticides, into intermediates with reduced phytotoxicity.
 The ultimate result of these metabolic conversions is often movement of the altered xenobiotic into the vacuole of the plant cell or incorporation into cells walls.
 These three phases are:
 Phase I - initial reactions such as oxidation, reduction or hydrolysis, hydrolysis,
 Phase II - primary conjugation with endogenous substrates such as sugars, amino acids, or glutathione, glutathione,
 Phase III - secondary conjugation, formation of insoluble residues or sequestration in the vacuole.
 Click here to view the metabolism animation and see how a generic herbicide is altered through these three phases of metabolism.
 How does herbicide metabolism protect crops but not weeds from injury or death?
 Rarely can plants mineralize a xenobiotic or completely oxidize it to CO2 like microorganisms can.
 On the other hand, animals and insects use only the first two phases, but and metabolism is usually faster and localized in an organ such as the liver or fat body; the metabolite is then eliminated from the body by excretion.
 Plants must alter these chemicals for long-term storage as non-toxic compounds because they are unable to excrete waste products.

 PhytoremediationFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia encyclopedia

 Phytoremediation (from the Ancient Greek f?t?
 (phyto, plant), and Latin remedium (restoring balance or remediation) describes the treatment of environmental problems (bioremediation) through the use of plants that mitigate the environmental problem without the need to excavate the contaminant material and dispose of it elsewhere.
 Phytoremediation consists of mitigating pollutant concentrations in contaminated soils, water, or air, with plants able to contain, degrade, or eliminate metals, pesticides, solvents, explosives, crude oil and its derivatives, and various other contaminants from the media that contain them.

  ApplicationPhytoremediation may be applied wherever the soil or static water environment has become polluted or is suffering ongoing chronic pollution.
 Examples where phytoremediation has been used successfully include the restoration of abandoned metal-mine workings, reducing the impact of sites where polychlorinated biphenyls have been dumped during manufacture and mitigation of on-going coal mine discharges.
 Phytoremediation refers to the natural ability of certain plants called hyperaccumulators to bioaccumulate, degrade,or render harmless contaminants in soils, water, or air.
 Contaminants such as metals, pesticides, solvents, explosives, and crude oil and its derivatives, have been mitigated in phytoremediation projects worldwide.
 Many plants such as mustard plants, alpine pennycress and pigweed have proven to be successful at hyperaccumulating contaminants at toxic waste sites.
 Phytoremediation is considered a clean, cost-effective and non-environmentally disruptive technology, as opposed to mechanical cleanup methods such as soil excavation or pumping polluted groundwater.
 Over the past 20 years, this technology has become increasingly popular and has been employed at sites with soils contaminated with lead, uranium, and arsenic.
 However, one major disadvantage of phytoremediation is that it requires a long-term commitment, as the process is dependent on plant growth, tolerance to toxicity, and bioaccumulation capacity.
  Advantages and limitationsAdvantages:
 the cost of the phytoremediation is lower than that of traditional processes both in situ and ex situ situ
 the plants can be easily monitored monitored
 the possibility of the recovery and re-use of valuable metals (by companies specializing in �phyto mining�) mining�)
 it is potentially the least harmful method because it uses naturally occurring organisms and preserves the environment in a more natural state.
 Limitations:
 phytoremediation is limited to the surface area and depth occupied by the roots.
 slow growth and low biomass require a long-term commitment commitment
 with plant-based systems of remediation, it is not possible to completely prevent the leaching of contaminants into the groundwater (without the complete removal of the contaminated ground, which in itself does not resolve the problem of contamination) contamination)
 the survival of the plants is affected by the toxicity of the contaminated land and the general condition of the soil.
 bio-accumulation of contaminants, especially metals, into the plants which then pass into the food chain, from primary level consumers upwards or requires the safe disposal of the affected plant material.
  Various phytoremediation processesA range of processes mediated by plants or algae are useful in treating environmental problems:
 Phytoextraction � uptake and concentration of substances from the environment into the plant biomass.
 Phytostabilization � reducing the mobility of substances in the environment, for example, by limiting the leaching of substances from the soil.
 Phytotransformation � chemical modification of environmental substances as a direct result of plant metabolism, often resulting in their inactivation, degradation (phytodegradation), or immobilization (phytostabilization).
 Phytostimulation � enhancement of soil microbial activity for the degradation of contaminants, typically by organisms that associate with roots.
 This process is also known as rhizosphere degradation.
 Phytostimulation can also involve aquatic plants supporting active populations of microbial degraders, as in the stimulation of atrazine degradation by hornwort.[2] hornwort.[2]
 Phytovolatilization � removal of substances from soil or water with release into the air, sometimes as a result of phytotransformation to more volatile and/or less polluting substances.
 Rhizofiltration � filtering water through a mass of roots to remove toxic substances or excess nutrients.
 The pollutants remain absorbed in or absorbed to the roots.
  PhytoextractionPhytoextraction (or phytoaccumulation) uses plants or algae to remove contaminants from soils, sediments or water into harvestable plant biomass (organisms that take larger-than-normal amounts of contaminants from the soil are called hyperaccumulators).
 Phytoextraction has been growing rapidly in popularity worldwide for the last twenty years or so.
 In general, this process has been tried more often for extracting heavy metals than for organics.
 At the time of disposal, contaminants are typically concentrated in the much smaller volume of the plant matter than in the initially contaminated soil or sediment.
 'Mining with plants', or phytomining, is also being experimented with.
 The plants absorb contaminants through the root system and store them in the root biomass and/or transport them up into the stems and/or leaves.
 A living plant may continue to absorb contaminants until it is harvested.
 After harvest, a lower level of the contaminant will remain in the soil, so the growth/harvest cycle must usually be repeated through several crops to achieve a significant cleanup.
 After the process, the cleaned soil can support other vegetation.
 Advantages:
 The main advantage of phytoextraction is environmental friendliness.
 Traditional methods that are used for cleaning up heavy metal-contaminated soil disrupt soil structure and reduce soil productivity, whereas phytoextraction can clean up the soil without causing any kind of harm to soil quality.
 Another benefit of phytoextraction is that it is less expensive than any other clean-up process.
 Disadvantages:
 As this process is controlled by plants, it takes more time than anthropogenic soil clean-up methods.
 Two versions of phytoextraction:
 natural hyper-accumulation, where plants naturally take up the contaminants in soil unassisted, and and
 induced or assisted hyper-accumulation, in which a conditioning fluid containing a chelator or another agent is added to soil to increase metal solubility or mobilization so that the plants can absorb them more easily.
 In many cases natural hyperaccumulators are metallophyte plants that can tolerate and incorporate high levels of toxic metals.
 Examples of phytoextraction (see also 'Table of hyperaccumulators'):
 Arsenic, using the Sunflower (Helianthus annuus), or the Chinese Brake fern (Pteris vittata), a hyperaccumulator.
 Chinese Brake fern stores arsenic in its leaves.
 Cadmium, using Willow (Salix viminalis):
 In 1999, one research experiment performed by Maria Greger and Tommy Landberg suggested Willow (Salix viminlais) has a significant potential as a phytoextractor of Cadmium (Cd), Zinc (Zn), and Copper (Cu), as willow has some specific characteristics like high transport capacity of heavy metals from root to shoot and huge amount of biomass production; can be used also for production of bio energy in the biomass energy power plant.[3] plant.[3]
 Cadmium and zinc, using Alpine pennycress (Thlaspi caerulescens), a hyperaccumulator of these metals at levels that would be toxic to many plants.
 On the other hand, the presence of copper seems to impair its growth (see table for reference).
 Lead, using Indian Mustard (Brassica juncea), Ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), Hemp Dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum), or Poplar trees, which sequester lead in their biomass.
 Salt-tolerant (moderately halophytic) barley and/or sugar beets are commonly used for the extraction of Sodium chloride (common salt) to reclaim fields that were previously flooded by sea water.
 Caesium-137 and strontium-90 were removed from a pond using sunflowers after the Chernobyl accident.[4] accident.[4]
 Mercury, selenium and organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been removed from soils by transgenic plants containing genes for bacterial enzymes.[5] enzymes.[5]
  PhytostabilizationPhytostabilization focuses on long-term stabilization and containment of the pollutant.
 Example, the plant's presence can reduce wind erosion; or the plant's roots can prevent water erosion, immobilize the pollutants by adsorption or accumulation, and provide a zone around the roots where the pollutant can precipitate and stabilize.
 Unlike phytoextraction, phytostabilization focuses mainly on sequestering pollutants in soil near the roots but not in plant tissues.
 Pollutants become less bioavailable, and livestock, wildlife, and human exposure is reduced.
 An example application of this sort is using a vegetative cap to stabilize and contain mine tailings.[6] tailings.[6]
  PhytotransformationIn the case of organic pollutants, such as pesticides, explosives, solvents, industrial chemicals, and other xenobiotic substances, certain plants, such as Cannas, render these substances non-toxic by their metabolism.
 In other cases, microorganisms living in association with plant roots may metabolize these substances in soil or water.
 These complex and recalcitrant compounds cannot be broken down to basic molecules (water, carbon-dioxide, etc.) by plant molecules, and, hence, the term phytotransformation represents a change in chemical structure without complete breakdown of the compound.
 The term "Green Liver Model" is used to describe phytotransformation, as plants behave analogously to the human liver when dealing with these xenobiotic compounds(foreign compound/pollutant).[7] After uptake of the xenobiotics, plant enzymes increase the polarity of the xenobiotics by adding functional groups such as hydroxyl groups (-OH).
 This is known as Phase I metabolism, similar to the way that the human liver increases the polarity of drugs and foreign compounds (Drug Metabolism).
 Whereas in the human liver enzymes such as Cytochrome P450s are responsible for the initial reactions, in plants enzymes such as nitroreductases carry out the same role.
 In the second stage of phytotransformation, known as Phase II metabolism, plant biomolecules such as glucose and amino acids are added to the polarized xenobiotic to further increase the polarity (known as conjugation).
 This is again similar to the processes occurring in the human liver where glucuronidation (addition of glucose molecules by the UGT (e.g.
 UGT1A1) class of enzymes) and glutathione addition reactions occur on reactive centres of the xenobiotic.
 Phase I and II reactions serve to increase the polarity and reduce the toxicity of the compounds, although many exceptions to the rule are seen.
 The increased polarity also allows for easy transport of the xenobiotic along aqueous channels.
 In the final stage of phytotransformation (Phase III metabolism), a sequestration of the xenobiotic occurs within the plant.
 The xenobiotics polymerize in a lignin-like manner and develop a complex structure that is sequestered in the plant.
 This ensures that the xenobiotic is safely stored, and does not affect the functioning of the plant.
 However, preliminary studies have shown that these plants can be toxic to small animals (such as snails), and, hence, plants involved in phytotransformation may need to be maintained in a closed enclosure.
 Hence, the plants reduce toxicity (with exceptions) and sequester the xenobiotics in phytotransformation.
 Trinitrotoluene phytotransformation has been extensively researched and a transformation pathway has been proposed.[8] proposed.[8]
  The role of geneticsBreeding programs and genetic engineering are powerful methods for enhancing natural phytoremediation capabilities, or for introducing new capabilities into plants.
 Genes for phytoremediation may originate from a micro-organism or may be transferred from one plant to another variety better adapted to the environmental conditions at the cleanup site.
 For example, genes encoding a nitroreductase from a bacterium were inserted into tobacco and showed faster removal of TNT and enhanced resistance to the toxic effects of TNT.[9] Researchers have also discovered a mechanism in plants that allows them to grow even when the pollution concentration in the soil is lethal for non-treated plants.
 Some natural, biodegradable compounds, such as exogenous polyamines, allow the plants to tolerate concentrations of pollutants 500 times higher than untreated plants, and to absorb more pollutants.
  Hyperaccumulators and biotic interactionsA plant is said to be a hyperaccumulator if it can concentrate the pollutants in a minimum percentage which varies according to the pollutant involved (for example:
 more than 1000 mg/kg of dry weight for nickel, copper, cobalt, chromium or lead; or more than 10,000 mg/kg for zinc or manganese).[10] This capacity for accumulation is due to hypertolerance, or phytotolerance:
 the result of adaptative evolution from the plants to hostile environments through many generations.
 A number of interactions may be affected by metal hyperaccumulation, including protection, interferences with neighbour plants of different species, mutualism (including mycorrhizae, pollen and seed dispersal), commensalism, and biofilm.

 Biodegradation Biodegradation
 Living organisms, from bacteria to humans, display a coordinated transcriptional response to xenobiotic exposure, inducing enzymes and transporters that facilitate detoxification.
 Several transcription factors have been identified in vertebrates that contribute to this regulatory response.
 In contrast, little is known about this pathway in insects.
 Here we show that the Drosophila Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) ortholog CncC (cap �n� collar isoform-C) is a central regulator of xenobiotic detoxification responses.
 A binding site for CncC and its heterodimer partner Maf (muscle aponeurosis fibromatosis) is sufficient and necessary for robust transcriptional responses to three xenobiotic compounds:
 phenobarbital (PB), chlorpromazine, and caffeine.
 Genetic manipulations that alter the levels of CncC or its negative regulator, Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), lead to predictable changes in xenobiotic-inducible gene expression.
 Transcriptional profiling studies reveal that more than half of the genes regulated by PB are also controlled by CncC.
 Consistent with these effects on detoxification gene expression, activation of the CncC/Keap1 pathway in Drosophila is sufficient to confer resistance to the lethal effects of the pesticide malathion.
 These studies establish a molecular mechanism for the regulation of xenobiotic detoxification in Drosophila and have implications for controlling insect populations and the spread of insect-borne human diseases.
 Xenobiotics are synthetic compounds not normally found in nature.
 They can be broadly classified as pesticides, detergents & plastics.
 Degradation of xenobiotics pose a challenge to the mankind.
 Although microbes help in bioremediation of xenobiotics, the process is slow.
 The plastics industry produces about 70 billion pounds of plastics per year, about half of which ends up in landfills.
 The difficulty in degrading these along with the shortage of landfill space is posing new challenges for the environmental engineer.
 Enzymes to degrade several commonly used insecticides like organophosphates, carbaryl, many synthetic pyrethroid and endosulfan have been isolated.
 The entry of microbes in the field of polymer science has opened up new areas of bioremediation research of platics.
 Konark biosciences offers the following bioremediation solutions of Xenobiotics:
 Degradation of recalcitrant organics such as pesticides/ herbicides/fungicides herbicides/fungicides
 Treatment of pesticide residue in soil and ground water.
 Immune function may be significantly altered following occupational, inadvertent or therapeutic exposure to chemically diverse xenobiotics.
 The environmental chemicals like pesticides, halogenated hydrocarbons, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, organic solvents, asbestos, silica, heavy metals etc.
 may interact with both cellular and humoral components of the immune system which can result in altered immune status that in turn may lead to decreased resistance to infection, certain forms of neoplasia or in some cases exacerbate allergy or autoimmunity.
 Recent advances in pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics have contributed a lot to delineate the mechanism of interaction of xenobiotics with the biological system at the cellular and molecular level.
 However, detection of immune changes on exposure to immunotoxic agents is highly complex, especially in humans due to several confounding factors like age, sex, race gender, co- existence of disease, food habits, smoking etc.
 Thus, establishing a quantitative relationship between immunotoxicological data and risk assessment, following xenobiotic exposure is still a challenge.
 The present article reviews the immune alterations caused by exposure to variety of xenobiotics, and their implications in health and disease.
 Background Background
 Honey bees (Apis mellifera) have recently experienced higher than normal overwintering colony losses.
 Many factors have been evoked to explain the losses, among which are the presence of residues of pesticides and veterinary products in hives.
 Multiple residues are present at the same time, though most often in low concentrations so that no single product has yet been associated with losses.
 Involvement of a combination of residues to losses may however not be excluded.
 To understand the impact of an exposure to combined residues on honey bees, we propose a mechanism-based strategy, focusing here on Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR) transporters as mediators of those interactions.
 Methodology/Principal Findings Findings
 Using whole-animal bioassays, we demonstrate through inhibition by verapamil that the widely used organophosphate and pyrethroid acaricides coumaphos and t-fluvalinate, and three neonicotinoid insecticides:
 imidacloprid, acetamiprid and thiacloprid are substrates of one or more MDR transporters.
 Among the candidate inhibitors of honey bee MDR transporters is the in-hive antibiotic oxytetracycline.
 Bees prefed oxytetracycline were significantly sensitized to the acaricides coumaphos and t-fluvalinate, suggesting that the antibiotic may interfere with the normal excretion or metabolism of these pesticides.
 Conclusions/Significance Conclusions/Significance
 Many bee hives receive regular treatments of oxytetracycline and acaricides for prevention and treatment of disease and parasites.
 Our results suggest that seasonal co-application of these medicines to bee hives could increase the adverse effects of these and perhaps other pesticides.
 Our results also demonstrate the utility of a mechanism-based strategy.
 By identifying pesticides and apicultural medicines that are substrates and inhibitors of xenobiotic transporters we prioritize the testing of those chemical combinations most likely to result in adverse interactions.
 Introduction Top Top
 Honey bees are in trouble.
 Widespread depopulation of colonies often characterized by high overwintering losses has occurred since at least 2006 in the United States, threatening the sustainability of North American apiculture.
 Despite considerable effort, no single cause of the phenomenon called colony collapse disorder (CCD) has been identified, though associations of several pathogens and parasites appear to increase the risk of colony collapse , [2].
 Pesticides are also among the suspected contributing factors of colony collapse both because bees encounter a diverse array of pesticides when foraging and because more than 120 different pesticides have been found within bee hives [2], [3], [4], [5], [6].
 Some pesticides have received extra scrutiny, notably the acaricides coumaphos and t-fluvalinate, applied to bee hives for control of parasitic varroa mites, and the widely used neonicotinoid insecticides.
 These acaricides are applied directly to bee hives, accumulate in wax and were found in nearly all hives recently tested in both N.
 American and France [5], [6].
 The neonicotinoids (especially imidacloprid) are of concern because they are toxic to honey bees, used on many crops and ornamental plants, and they tend to be systemically distributed within treated plants, potentially contaminating nectar and pollen of treated and rotational crops not initially treated with these products [7], [8], [9], [10].
 Although pesticide drift and overdosing cause accidental bee kills no single pesticide has been directly implicated with widespread overwintering losses or CCD [2], [5].
 It remains possible however, that combinations of toxins may cause adverse additive or synergistic effects that would be difficult to detect through surveys of beekeepers or analysis of their apiaries without dedicated multifactorial analysis.
 It has been shown, for example, that the toxicity to bees of some pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides increases significantly when combined with certain fungicides [11], [12].
 Similarly, Johnson et al.
 [13] found that coumaphos and t-fluvalinate each synergize the other's toxicity to honey bees, perhaps through competitive inhibition of the metabolic enzymes that detoxify those pesticides.
 Given the many pesticides that bees encounter there may be adverse combinations of them eroding hive health in both subtle and dramatic ways.
 The problem, of course, is the large number of potentially adverse pesticide combinations which prevents evaluation of all, or even most, combinations of them.
 This problem challenges our ability to anticipate the risks associated with bee's exposure to a novel pesticide or to identify combinations of toxins contributing to a colony collapse.
 If we could identify mechanisms of the honey bee xenobiotic metabolism and excretion systems that systematically mediate multiple-toxin interactions, we could reduce the overwhelming number of candidate pesticide interactions to a smaller set of compounds that are substrates or inhibitors of the most predictive mechanisms.
 The membrane-bound transporter proteins from the ABC transporter family of proteins are found in all phyla [14], [15].
 The xenobiotic transporters in this family actively shuttle toxins across cell membranes to reduce the intracellular toxin and metabolite concentrations.
 Working in concert with metabolic enzymes, these transporters mediate a baseline tolerance to a diverse array of toxins including numerous drugs, pesticides and phytochemicals [16], [17].
 Several of these transporters, especially members of the ABCB, ABCC, and ABCG subfamilies of transporters (referred to here as Multiple Drug Resistance, or MDR transporters), are of medical importance, playing a role in resistance to multiple cancer and anti-parasite drugs [17], [18], [19].
 MDR transporters are relatively unstudied in insects, and completely neglected in honey bee toxicology.
 These transporters act in several insect tissues, including the cuticle [20], malpighian tubules [21], [22], midgut [23] and at the blood-brain barrier [24], [25] to transport toxins, including pesticides, towards excretion [17].
 The honey bee genome contains genes coding for orthologues of these proteins, which presumably protect bees from toxins as they do in Drosophila melanogaster [24], [26], [27], chironomid flies [28], mosquitoes [29], Heliothis virescens (tobacco budworm) [20] and Manduca sexta (tomato hornworm) [21], [25].
 It seems reasonable therefore to consider the role that these proteins play in honey bee tolerance of pesticides and to begin an analysis of potentially inhibitory compounds that bees commonly encounter.
 The most well studied MDR transporter, p-glycoprotein (p-gp), has both a diverse range of substrates and is inhibited by an array of drugs, pesticides and plant compounds [17].
 This inhibition is a mechanism by which MDR transporters would cause adverse interactions among many chemicals; one compound inhibits the transporters thereby increasing sensitivity to other toxic substrates.
 The drug verapamil is a potent inhibitor of p-gp and possibly other MDR transporters [30], [31].
 It is frequently used as the standard inhibitor of p-gp where it increases the sensitivity of treated cells, tissues or organisms to toxic transporter substrates [17], [18], [26].
 Here we use verapamil inhibition to determine if 5 pesticides are substrates of MDR transporters and therefore potentially synergized by other inhibitors more likely to be encountered by honey bees.
 Remarkably, three widely used in-hive pesticides and medications (the previously mentioned acaricides coumaphos and t-fluvalinate and the antibiotic oxytetracycline) are known substrates and/or inhibitors of mammalian p-gp [31], [32], [33].
 We suspect that these in-hive medications and pesticides may be interacting with bee's MDR transporters, increasing their sensitivity to these and perhaps other pesticides and toxins.
 The frequent contamination of hive wax with these acaricides [6] and routine treatment of hives with oxytetracycline [34], [35], [36], [37] undoubtedly increases the exposure of bees to these compounds, with potentially significant consequences if they are indeed substrates or inhibitors of honey bee MDR transporters.
 Interaction of neonicotinoid insecticides with insect MDR transporters has not yet been reported.
 Because of the likelihood of exposure of bees to these insecticides we ask if the neonicotinoid insecticides imidacloprid, acetamiprid and thiacloprid are substrates of honey bee MDR transporters.
 Evidence of neonicotinoid processing by MDR transporters would be significant because inhibition of those transporters could cause mortality at lower doses than normally expected for individual compounds.
 Results Top Top
 When fed to bees verapamil significantly increased the toxicity of all 5 acaricides/insecticides.
 Mean mortality of young worker bees topically treated with the acaricides coumaphos or t-fluvalinate was significantly higher when bees were pretreated with verapamil (Fig.
 1, Table 1).
 Control mortality following topical application of acetone was 0% for both sucrose and sucrose+verapamil fed bees.
 Acute oral toxicity was also significantly higher for all three neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, thiacloprid, imidacloprid) when bees were pretreated with verapamil (Fig.
 1, Table 2).
 Increased mortality at higher concentrations and at the later end point (48 h) was observed for thiacloprid, and at 48 h for imidacloprid.
 The effect of verapamil pretreatment did not differ among concentrations of these insecticides (Table 2).
 Control mortality of sucrose only and sucrose+verapamil cohorts averaged 2�3%.
 Discussion Top Top
 Here we provide the first evidence that the MDR transporter(s) inhibited by verapamil play a role in protecting honey bees from pesticides, and that the acaricides coumaphos and t-fluvalinate, and 3 neonicotinoid insecticides are substrates of these transporters in insects.
 The observation that coumaphos and t-fluvalinate are substrates of honey bee p-gp or another MDR transporter was anticipated from previous study of mouse cells, and suggests that insect and mammalian MDR transporters share substrates.
 Clearly, the abundance of these pesticides found in the wax and pollen of bee hives [6] coupled with evidence that their toxicity to bees is increased through inhibition of MDR transporters implicates them as toxins of interest in any multifactorial explanation of high overwintering colony losses.
 This is the first report that neonicotinoid insecticides are substrates of insect MDR transporters.
 In efforts to protect honey bees, energetic opposition to the neonicotinoids has arisen in North America and Europe, but direct implication of them in overwintering losses has not been sustained by recent research [2], [6].
 Estimates of the environmental exposure of bees to imidacloprid are typically low relative to the LD50 [6], and studies have not demonstrated hive-level consequences of imidacloprid contamination [38].
 Our results suggest that inhibition of MDR transporters may reduce the LD50 of neonicotinoids possibly amplifying acute and chronic effects to bees at lower concentrations.
 The large increases in sensitivity to pesticides by inhibition of MDR transporters and the chemical diversity of the synergized pesticides suggest that these transporters may mediate adverse synergisms of diverse toxins in bees.
 Because of its clinical importance in human health, proven and candidate p-gp substrates and inhibitors of many types have been identified [16], [17].
 Knowledge of these compounds may help us identify chemicals likely to interact with honey bee MDR transporters.
 In the first application of this mechanism-based strategy to honey bees, we uncover a significant negative interaction among three medications routinely applied to bee hives [35], [36], [37].
 OTC, coumaphos and t-fluvalinate are all known to interact with mammalian p-gp [31], [32], [33].
 If honey bee transporters behave similarly, we would expect increased toxicity following co-application of a toxic transporter substrate and an inhibitor.
 As anticipated, concentrations of OTC similar to those applied to bee hives increased bee's sensitivity to both coumaphos and t-fluvalinate.
 OTC is applied to bee hives in the late fall and/or early spring, often in tandem with one of the acaricides [36].
 Our results suggest that co-application of these compounds could increase the likelihood of intoxication by the acaricides and other pesticides contaminating beeswax and food stores.
 These results raise the possibility that adverse interactions of medications (such as OTC) and pesticides (coumaphos and t-fluvalinate) contribute to the loss of honey bee colonies during the winter or early spring, a common feature of CCD.
 Although the per-bee concentration of OTC used here is similar to field application rates, the pesticide concentrations are higher than those found in bee hives (see [6]).
 Therefore, although we have demonstrated that verapamil and OTC increase bee's sensitivity to these pesticides in acute laboratory bioassays, additional testing of lower pesticide concentrations over longer time periods is necessary to fully understand the field relevance of these interactions.
 Additional work is also required to directly demonstrate that OTC inhibits p-gp or other efflux transporters in honey bees.
 Nevertheless, we show here using OTC and the acaricides as an example, how identification of MDR transporter substrates and inhibitors can highlight potentially dangerous chemical combinations and improve the assessment and management of toxicological risks faced by honey bees.

 Insects Insects
 Bees were collected for laboratory bioassays from newly established colonies reared on new frames and freshly drawn comb.
 Colonies were not treated with apicultural medications or pesticides.
 Frames with emerging workers were taken from hives and placed into dark growth chambers maintained at 33�2�C and (70�80%) RH.
 Newly-emerged bees were collected from the frames daily and maintained in groups of 20�30 in 80�100 mm metal mesh cages capped at each end by standard polystyrene petri dishes.
 Bees were fed sucrose solution (50%; w:v) through 1 mm holes from a 2.0 ml microfuge tube.
 Chemicals Chemicals
 Terramycin (oxytetracycline, 5.5% soluble powder, Pfizer) was purchased from Dadant and Sons (Hamilton, Illinois).
 Coumaphos, t-fluvalinate (both technical grade) and verapamil were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc.
 (St.
 Louis, MO).
 Commercial formulations of imidacloprid (Admire Pro) and thiacloprid (Calypso) were provided by Bayer CropScience (Durham, NC), and acetamiprid (Assail) was provided by United Phosphorous Inc.
 (King of Prussia, PA).
 Drug pretreatments pretreatments
 Verapamil (1 mM) and oxytetracycline (OTC, 1.4 mM) were incorporated into 50% sucrose solutions for oral dosing of 1�3 day old workers.
 Preliminary feeding trials of 1 mM solutions of oral verapamil revealed no toxicity.
 The 1.4 mM concentration of OTC provides a per-bee exposure comparable to that of the label-recommended dosage of 600 mg applied to a hive containing 12,000 bees�a typical colony size entering winter [39].
 Sucrose-drug solutions were made fresh every 3 days and the vials supplying each cage were replaced as needed.
 Topical bioassays of insecticides/acaricides insecticides/acaricides
 Cohorts of 3�6 day old workers pretreated by feeding with the two sucrose-drug solutions were anesthetized with CO2, and 1 ul of coumaphos (2 ug/ul)or t-fluvalinate (3 ug/ul) in acetone (or acetone alone for controls) was applied to the dorsal thorax of each bee using an ISCO microapplicator driving a 1/4 cc tuberculin syringe.
 After application, bees were returned to cages containing the sucrose-drug or sucrose-only solution.
 Mortality of bees in each cage was recorded at 24 and 48 h.
 5�10 replicate cohorts of 25 bees were tested for each acaricide - pretreatment combination.
 Oral bioassays of insecticides insecticides
 Pre-fed cohorts of 3�6 day old workers were fed sucrose syrup containing one of the neonicotinoids.
 Mortality of each cage was recorded at 24 and 48 hours.
 Imidacloprid was tested at 5 and 50 ng/ul, acetamiprid at 25 and 100 ng/ul, and thiacloprid at 25, 100 and 500 ng/ul.
 These concentrations caused low-intermediate mortality of bees fed sucrose-only solution in preliminary range-finding experiments.
 2�13 replicate cohorts of 25 bees were tested for each toxin concentration - pretreatment combination.
 Analysis.The effects of verapamil or OTC pretreatment on insecticide/acaricide mortality were tested using a repeated measures analysis of variance (Proc Mixed, SAS).
 Following transformation (arcsine square-root), mortality was analyzed with a model that included pretreatment, insecticide concentration if multiple levels were used, and time endpoints (24 and 48 h) as fixed factors to assess the main effects and their interactions.
 Because only mortality at 24 h was available, analysis of t-fluvalinate combined with OTC, was performed using a simple t-test, comparing the t-fluvalinate and the t-fluvalinate+OTC treatments.

 ABSTRACT ABSTRACT
 A primary concern with composting is the lack of knowledge about the fate of widely used pesticides.
 Also, there is increasing interest in the use of composting as a bioremediation method for soils contaminated with xenobiotics such as TNT, PCBs, chlorophenols and PAHs.
 We used a laboratory scale composting system to determine the extent of mineralization, incorporation into humic matter, and volatilization, during the composting of yard trimmings amended with 14C labeled pesticides such as 2,4-D, diazinon, and pendimethalin.
 Our results showed that the pesticides studied have very different fates during composting.
 For example, 2,4-D is rapidly mineralized and transformed into high molecular weight humic compounds.
 Diazinon, on the other hand, is not readily mineralized, but undergoes rapid transformation to water soluble metabolites, while pendimethalin appears to be converted primarily into unextractable residues.
 Atrazine mineralization during composting is limited and varies with different lignocellulosic substrates.
 Preliminary results show that limited degradation of PCBs occurs during the composting of contaminated soils.
 Our results also indicate that thermophilic microbial communities are involved in the mineralization and biotransformation of xenobiotics during composting.
 Introduction Composting is an aerobic thermophilic process widely used for the recycling of organic residues such as yard trimmings, agricultural wastes, food wastes, and biosolids.
 Gradients of oxygen, nutrients, and temperature that exist in compost support a diverse microbial population and rapid organic matter conversion (6).
 There is also a growing interest in using composting for the bioremediation of soils and sludges contaminated with xenobiotics (2,3,4,15,16).
 In this paper we present our work on the fate of xenobiotics such as pesticides and PCBs during composting, and describe efforts to identify thermophilic microorganisms involved in their degradation.
 Pesticide Degradation during Composting Composting
 Pesticides are widely used in lawn care and agriculture in the US and around the world.
 In the U.S., over 30,000 tons of pesticides are used every year on lawns, turf farms and gardens.
 Although much is known about the fate and microbial degradation of pesticides in soils, little is known about their fate during composting (1,11).
 There is a general public concern about the possible persistence of pesticides in composts made from yard trimmings and agricultural residues.
 Our broad research goals are to study the fate of pesticides and other xenobiotics during composting and to advance our understanding of the microbial Microbial Processes during Composting communities involved in the turn over of the organic matter and in the degradation of xenobiotics during composting.
 We used a laboratory scale compost reactor system which simulates the temperature and aeration conditions typically found in windrows (7,8).
 Compost feed stock consisted of yard trimmings (2:1 leaves:grass, w/w) amended with 14C ring-labeled pesticides at 10-20 ppm.
 The extent of pesticide conversion to CO2, volatilization, humification, leaching, and biotransformation during composting were determined and these results are summarized here (Table 1).

 Microbial Processes during Composting 2,4-D, a post-emergence broad leaf herbicide, is the second most commonly used lawn care pesticide (approximately 3000 tons used per year) in the U.
 S.
 There have been varying reports on the levels of 2,4-D found in yard trimmings at composting facilities.
 One study reported that 2,4-D was detected in all samples at levels up to 5.5 ppm (9).
 Another study showed that after a standard application of 2,4-D to grass, 80 ppm was found on day 0, 45 ppm on day 14, and 6 ppm on day 56 (9).
 During composting with yard trimmings, 48% of the 14C-2,4-D was mineralized to 14CO2 after 50 days of composting (7).
 Most of the remaining 2,4-D was transformed into high molecular weight humic compounds or was unextractable.
 Diazinon is a broad-spectrum insecticide which is the single most widely used lawn care pesticide.
 Approximately 5000 tons are used per year in the U.
 S.
 At yard trimmings composting sites, diazinon has been found in a majority of the incoming yard trimmings samples at concentrations up to 5 ppm.
 Typically, the amount of diazinon on grass cut within a week of a standard pesticide application is 5 to 9 ppm (5).
 When diazinon amended yard trimmings were composted, low amounts (11%) of diazinon were transformed to CO2.
 The bulk of the diazinon carbon, however, was transformed into a potentially leachable but less toxic hydrolysis product (isopropyl methyl hydroxy pyrimidine), and into unextractable and/or high molecular weight residues which are presumed to have low bioavailability (8).
 After 10 days of composting, no diazinon was detectable in lab scale composts.
 Diazinon degradation was faster during composting than that reported in soils, apparently due to the higher temperatures and greater moisture content of compost as compared to soils.
 The extent of diazinon volatilization observed in composting studies varies greatly (Table 1), perhaps due to the level of diazinon added, the feedstock used, the amounts of compost in the bench scale reactors, and the moisture content of the compost (8,13).
 Pendimethalin (trade name Prowl�) is a preemergence herbicide that is commonly used to control broadleaf and grassy weeds.
 Although 5 to 40 ppm pendimethalin are found on cut grass after a standard application (5), generally low levels (� 0.13 ppm) are found in yard trimmings at composting facilities (9).
 During composting of yard trimmings, little pendimethalin was mineralized (13%).
 However, much of the pendimethalin (73%) was transformed into humic and unextractable residues (9).
 Atrazine is one of the most widely used agricultural pesticides in the U.S.
 accounting for 12 percent of all pesticides used.
 It has widespread use in the control of broad-leaf weeds in corn, sorghum and certain other crops, and for lawn care.
 Also, it is one of the most frequently detected pesticides in surface waters in the U.S.
 Pesticide laden rinse waters from agricultural sites can contain up to 2000 ppm atrazine and atrazine has been detected in well waters at levels as high as 25 ug/liter.
 Rao et al (12) employed 14C-atrazine amended wood products to determine the extent of atrazine mineralization and biodegradation during composting.
 Their results showed that atrazine carbon was mostly chloroform-extractable before composting but after 40 days of composting, much of the atrazine carbon had been converted into methanol- and NaOH- extractable residues.
 TLC analysis showed no detectable atrazine in the methanol extracts.
 These findings indicate that atrazine is converted to polar metabolites and is largely incorporated into humic acids during composting.
 The amount of atrazine mineralization observed during composting was from 2 to 7%, depending on the feedstock used (12).
 Microbial Processes during Composting Composting
 Thus varying degrees of mineralization and humification of different pesticides are found during composting.
 Humification appears to be largely mediated by compost microorganisms, because in sterilized control composters the extent of conversion of pesticide carbon to humates was negligible (7).
 It should be noted, however, that there is little definitive information on the nature of pesticide-humate complexes, the amounts of pesticide carbon released over time from such complexes, and the relative toxicity of the pesticide carbon released.
 It is generally believed that the release of pesticide carbon from pesticide-humate complexes is a relatively slow process.
 Bioremediation of Xenobiotics in Soils via Composting Composts and composting have recently been used for the bioremediation of soils contaminated with explosives.
 In a field scale demonstration, Williams et al., (16) showed that explosives in contaminated soils such as TNT, RDX, nitrocellulose and HMX were reduced from greater than 10,000 ppm to less than 50 ppm during composting.
 In a succeeding study, Pennington (10) studied the fate of from 14C TNT during composting and showed that almost no 14CO2 was produced.
 Much of the 14C-TNT was converted to amino derivatives of TNT and to conjugation products with cellulose and humin.
 Chlorophenols were widely used as wood preservatives.
 These are important pollutants which persist in the environment, especially in soils near wood-processing facilities.
 Laine et al (4) showed that 14C chlorophenols are converted primarily (60%) to 14CO2 during bench scale composting of contaminated soils with softwood bark.
 During field scale composting, chlorophenol concentrations decreased from 850 ppm to less than 50 ppm with the accumulation of various chlorophenol metabolites.
 Inoculation of some soils with a chlorophenol degrading enrichment culture improved the initial rate of chlorophenol degradation.
 Collectively, these studies showed that in general composting is less costly than incineration or other remediation alternatives.
 Another advantage of composting is that it generates topsoil for site restoration.
 In recent work, we have conducted field and laboratory scale tests on the bioremediation of PCB contaminated soils via composting.
 The microbial degradation of PCBs occurs primarily via cometabolism.
 In this process, PCBs are transformed, yet the organisms responsible are unable to grow on the PCBs and do not derive energy or carbon from their transformation.
 Therefore, a co-substrate is needed for microbial growth and activity.
 Composting can potentially provide both a highly diverse microbial environment, and the needed cosubstrates for PCB metabolism.
 Few investigations on the effectiveness of composting in degrading recalcitrant pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been reported.
 Snell (14) reported that as much as 75% of a lower chlorinated PCB mixture (Aroclor 1221) added at a concentration of 500 mg/kg disappeared after 30 days of composting.
 In another study, Hogan et al.
 (2) reported 83% disappearance of Aroclor 1232 (11 mg/kg) and 1.6% volatilization after 35 days of composting at 50�C.
 These early studies suggested that PCB degradation occurs at a faster rate during composting than in soils alone; however, congener specific analysis and 14C fate studies on PCB degradation were not done.
 We recently initiated a study to determine the effect of yard trimmings amendment on PCB degradation during composting of a contaminated soil.
 The contaminated soil was located at a former paper mill and had a PCB concentration of 51+ 21 ppm (identified as Microbial Processes during Composting Aroclor 1242), a moisture content of 65%, bulk density of 800 kg/m3, carbon content of 26%, C:N ratio of 50, and pH of 6.7.
 The contaminated soil was mixed with various levels of yard trimmings (1:1:1 leaves:grass:brush) and a shredder was used to mix the composts.
 The effect of amendment level on composting temperature, oxygen content, organic matter loss, and other environmental parameters which influence microbial activity were determined.
 These experiments showed that as little as 10% amendment (by weight) led to the development of active composting with temperatures greater than 50�C whereas little temperature change or oxygen uptake was observed in control piles containing soil alone.
 Degradation of PCB congeners in the composted soil was monitored by direct organic extraction and congener specific analysis.
 These results indicated a significant correlation between the level of amendment added to the contaminated soil and the overall PCB loss during composting.
 Less-chlorinated PCB congeners (1-3 chlorines) were degraded more than highly chlorinated congeners.
 Overall, however, the rate and extent of PCB degradation during composting was much less than that observed for pesticides and other organic contaminants.
 Microbiology of Thermophilic Xenobiotic Degradation Degradation
 An interesting question regarding xenobiotic degradation during composting is how thermophilic microorganisms and their enzymes responsible for this process differ from those active in mesophilic environments.
 We isolated thermophiles from lab scale composts that were actively mineralizing 2,4-D [Michel, Jr., FC, Topp E, Forney LJ, Reddy CA (1997) Abstr Ann Mtg Amer Soc Microbiol].
 The isolates grew on 2,4-D as the sole carbon and energy source at 60� C, but not at 37� or 25�, and were Gram positive, spore-forming, motile rods.
 Sequencing of 16S rDNAs amplified from these isolates indicated that they were closely related to group 5 thermophilic Bacilli.
 The total DNA from these isolates was analyzed by Southern hybridization using 2,4-D degradation pathway gene probes tfdA, tfdB, tfdC, tfdD and tfdE cloned from plasmid pJP4 of the mesophile Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134.
 No hybridization was observed at high stringency (>90% homology) with any of the strains.
 However, all of the probes hybridized at medium stringency (70-90% homology) with total DNA from one isolate (X2), and hybridized at low stringency (>60% homology) with total DNA from another (X3).
 These results suggest that genes from thermophilic 2,4-D degraders are somewhat similar to 2,4-D degradation genes widely found in gram negative mesophiles from soils.
 Future studies will aim to sequence these thermophilic 2,4-D degradation genes for comparison with mesophilic genes.
 Aerobic PCB degradation is believed to occur by cometabolism of biphenyl and similar compounds such as terpenes.
 A biphenyl dioxygenase (bphA) is known to be conserved in many PCB degrading mesophilic bacterial strains.
 However, the biphenyl degradation genes used by thermophilic PCB degraders are not known.
 By using primers corresponding to bphA genes from mesophiles, we recently PCR-amplified bphA genes using total DNA isolated from thermophilic composts made from PCB contaminated soils amended with yard trimmings [LaMontagne, MG, Quensen III JF, Tiedje JM, Reddy CA (1998) Abstr Ann Mtg Amer Soc Microbiol].
 The bphA gene sequence was also amplifiable from thermophilic yard trimmings compost made without PCB contaminated soil, indicating the ubiquitous nature of bphA like genes.
 The sequences of the amplified bphA gene fragments found in composts were closely related to those from mesophilic PCB degrading strains.

 Xenobiotics are organic compounds not synthesized by organisms and which are thus, foreign to the biosphere.
 Xenobiotics comprise pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial pollutants; they arrive at organisms accidentally or due to intended usage.
 Since xenobiotics may exert adverse effects on organisms, examination of their toxicity and metabolism prior to usage are today demanded by regulatory authorities of all countries.
 In case of pesticides, metabolism data are needed at early stages of development of candidates, since metabolites may exhibit an unacceptable toxicity.
 The same holds for pharmaceuticals and to a certain degree also for industrial pollutants.
 Additionally, metabolism plays a crucial role in tolerance, resistance and susceptibility, e.g.
 with herbicides and insecticides, as well as in phenomena observed with drugs and carcinogens.
 Regarding all aspects of xenobiotic metabolism, thorough chemical identification of metabolites is required.
 Several in vitro systems, including plant cell cultures, have been developed in order to generate rapidly a broad spectrum of metabolites for their identification.
 These screening procedures support inevitable studies conducted subsequently or in parallel with organisms under relevant conditions.
 Xenobiotic metabolism in man, animals and higher plants is usually subdivided in three phases:
 transformation (phase I), conjugation (phase II), and excretion in man/animals or compartmentation in plants (phase III).
 Typical phase I reactions are oxidation, hydrolysis and reduction.
 The resulting primary metabolites are those which are important e.g.
 for the evaluation of pesticides due to their possible toxicological properties.
 The most relevant phase I processes are oxidative reactions.
 In man, animals and plants, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are mainly responsible for oxidation of xenobiotics, which is an initial crucial step.
 Typical reactions are N-, O- and S-dealkylation, aromatic and aliphatic hydroxylation, epoxidation, oxidative desulfuration and sulfoxidation.
 Generation by in vitro systems of oxidized metabolites for chemical identification is thus, desirable.
 In man, eleven P450 isozymes are responsible for 90 % of all P450 reactions observed with xenobiotics.
 These crucial human P450s (prevailingly expressed in the liver) are CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C10, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4.
 They exhibit broad and overlapping substrate specificities.
 Nowadays, data on catalytic activities of the P450 isozymes towards xenobiotics are mainly derived from studies using bacteria or yeasts, which heterologously express the P450 genes, or from microsomes (commercially available) containing selected human P450s, which are produced by means of bacterial (Escherichia coli) or baculovirus expression systems.
 These systems require co-expression of NADPH-P450 reductase (supplier of necessary electrons), in order to obtain catalytically active P450s.
 In the last 15 years, studies were published on the overexpression of human P450 isozymes of families CYP1-3 in higher plants (tobacco, potato, rice).
 The plants were transformed with a single or several P450 genes.
 Objectives of these studies were the production of either herbicide-resistant plants (e.g.
 chlortoluron), or plants suitable for (phyto-) remediation of contaminated areas.
 Due to broad substrate specificities, the transgenic plants exhibited considerable enhancment of metabolic activity towards several herbicides (multiple resistance) or a range of contaminants.
 All experiments showed that co-expression of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase was not required; the human P450s cooperated sufficiently well with endogenous plant reductases.
 The project combines i) the importance of P450s in xenobiotic metabolism, ii) the broad substrate specificities of human P450s, iii) the convenient plant cell culture in vitro system often used in our lab, and iv) the ease of expressing catalytically active P450s in plant cells.
 It is intended as method to screen rapidly and qualitatively the principal patterns of oxidized xenobiotic metabolites, and to produce metabolites of concern on a larger scale for thorough chemical identification.
 The project was thought as first move of a series of investigations.
 Accordingly tobacco cell suspension cultures were transformed with human CYP1A1 and CYP1A2.
 The resulting P450-transgenic cell cultures were subsequently used for metabolism studies with the herbicides atrazine and metamitron, as well as the insecticide dimethoate.
 Environmental exposure to certain drugs, chemicals, radiation, and viruses can cause abnormal fetal development.
 A single teratogen can cause malformations of multiple body systems.
 Conversely, multiple teratogens can cause abnormal development of the same system.
 This leads to speculation that there may be some underlying mechanism in common to most teratogens.
 If such a mechanism could be established, it might be possible to develop a more rapid and accurate assay for potential teratogens.
 This paper explores the hypothesis that immunotoxicity may be a common marker for many established teratogens.
 The immune system is a frequent target organ of toxic insult following chronic or acute exposure to environmental chemicals, therapeutic drugs, abused drugs or radiation.
 Interaction of the immune system with these xenobiotics may result in undesirable effects of three principal types:
 1) immunosuppression; 2) immune deregulations (autoimmunity); and 3) immunologic response to the xenobiotic (allergy).
 (NTP Annual Plan 1986) The health implications of these immune dysfunctions are increased risk of infectious diseases; development of neoplasia; autoimmune disorders and allergies.
 (Berlin et al.
 1987) 1987)
 An analysis of current research on immunotoxins also suggests that prenatal exposure to xenobiotics can result in a fourth type of adverse outcome - teratogenesis.
 New research in developmental immunotoxicology is exploring the possibility that one teratogenic outcome of prenatal exposure to immunotoxins may be impairment of the developing fetal immune system.
 (NTP 1988) Children born with dysfunctional immune systems are at increased risk of allergies, chronic infections, autoimmune disease, learning problems and/or childhood cancer.
 Immunologically active agents can be divided into immunodepressants and immunostimulants, but a more appropriate term would be immunomodulators since both immunodepressants and immunostimulants can produce paradoxical immune effects.
 In fact, exposure to an immunodepressive xenobiotic may first be manifested by a form of immune hyperactivity since downregulatory cells may be more sensitive than helper-inducer immunocytes.
 (Spreafico 1987) 1987)
 Evidence that immunosuppressive agents may be teratogenic can be found as far back as the early sixties in research on thalidomide, the popular sedative which caused a worldwide epidemic of children with phocomelic limbs and other serious birth defects.
 Hellman and his co-workers were able to demonstrate that thalidomide was able to suppress immunological responses to transplanted tissue.
 A number of other chemical compounds such as aminopterin and methotrexate as well as radiation were also reported to have this immunosuppressive effect.
 These agents were generally teratogenic in mammals.
 It was observed, even in this early research, that immunosuppressive agents usually inhibit the cell divisions in growing tissues and that this effect is consistent with a teratogenic action as well as an immuno-toxic response.
 (Niilson 1962) 1962)
 The possibility of a consistency in the teratogenic effect of immunotoxins can be further explored in research on a broad range of xenobiotics which are immunotoxic and teratogenic in mammals including:
 lead, mercury, polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), diethylstilbestrol (DES) and other estrogenic compounds, ethylene glycol monomethyl ethers, diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin), antihistamines, pesticides, alcohol and marijuana and tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).
 Lead and Mercury - Studies have shown that human lead exposure has been related to immunosuppression manifested as increased susceptibility or severity of infection.
 (Hadden 1986) Although heavy metals like lead and mercury have been reported to be cytotoxic to numerous cell types, they are also able to induce allergic hypersensitivity.
 Any metal known to produce an allergic response may be a promoter of autoimmunity.
 Research has suggested that lead and mercury-induced immunomodulation can cause autoimmune disease.
 (Lawrence 1986) Animal studies have demonstrated that lead induced immune reactivity can also enhance the growth of tumors.
 (Lawrence 1986) 1986)
 Both lead and mercury are acknowledged teratogens.
 (NJDH 1986) Studies of children with prenatal exposure to high lead levels have demonstrated impairment in verbal processing and performance and sustained attention.
 Mercury is also teratogenic to the developing brain and can cause growth deficiency, blindness, deafness, microcephaly and poor muscle tone.
 Impaired immune function may be a delayed effect of prenatal exposure to methyl mercury.
 Disastrous effects on the unborn were documented in Minamata Bay, Japan when mothers consumed fish from mercury contaminated waters; in Iraq when 6,530 people ate mercury-treated seed grain and in New Mexico when animals fed on the contaminated seed grain were eaten by humans.
 (Smith 1982) 1982)
 Polybrominated biphehyls (PBBS) PBBs are flame-retardants used in clothing manufacture.
 In 1973, PBBs were introduced into the food chain in Michigan when they were accidentally substituted for a food supplement in feed for livestock.
 The effects of this contamination first became evident in the farm animals:
 cows, chickens and sheep that suffered severe wasting disease, abortions and deformed offspring - calves born with holes in their heads; lambs with no hind legs and deformed faces.
 When these PBB poisoned animals were inadvertently consumed by farm families and later customers of their products, men, women and children began to report symptoms of PBB toxicosis:
 blinding headaches, digestive problems, skin eruptions, inexplicable weight loss, fatigue, decreased resistance to infection, chest pains, decreased libido, nervousness, sleep disturbances, visual problems, irritability, memory problems, aching muscles and joints and decreased tolerance to alcohol.
 An epidemic of miscarriages and abortions was also reported in some rural communities.
 (Egginton 1977) 1977)
 Symptoms in both animals and humans first appeared after stress.
 PBBs are stored in the fat-soluble tissues of the body.
 As long as the toxin was quiescent in the fat it appeared to do little harm, but as soon as the fat was mobilized to cope with stress PBB began to devastate the system.
 Paradoxically, the sicker animals usually had the lowest levels of PBB in their bodies.
 These animals had gotten rid of most of the PBB through milk production and calving.
 They were showing the effects of the damage that the chemical had done to their systems.
 The healthier looking animals still had more of the PBB in their tissues.
 In humans, there were great variations of PBB levels within families and no apparent relationship between the levels of PBB in a person's tissues and the severity of symptoms.
 There seemed to be vast differences in the way people's bodies react to toxins.
 (Egginton 1977) 1977)
 Subsequent testing of the PBB-affected human population demonstrated immunological disturbances including depressed T-cell numbers, abnormalities in cell-mediated immunity, increased null cells and Ig levels.
 (Hadden 1986) 1986)
 Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) PCBs, compounds used as heat transfer media and plasticizers, have become a ubiquitous cause of environmental contamination.
 In animals, PCB immunotoxicity has been correlated with increased susceptibility and mortality from viruses, bacteria and parasites.
 Widespread human toxicity occurred after consumption of PCB contaminated rice oil in Japan and China.
 Immunotoxic effects included chloracne, decreases in serum Ig levels and impaired cell mediated immunity with decreased T cell numbers and function as well as increased susceptibility to respiratory infection.
 (Hadden 1986) PCBs are also probable cancer-causing agents in humans with evidence of an association between PCBs and skin cancer.
 (NJDH 1986) 1986)
 Follow-up studies of children exposed in utero to PCB have been reported by several researchers.
 Rogan and colleagues studied over 100 Taiwanese children conceived in the 5 years after their mothers had been poisoned by PCBs and their contaminants, the polychlorinated dibenzofurans.
 The children had a significant excess of ectodermal defects and developmental delays.
 In the U.S., studies have reported that at the upper end of exposures in the general population, there is evidence of motor impairment in newborn infants, motor delay in 6 and 12 month olds and impaired visual recognition memory in 7 month olds.
 (Rogan 1989) 1989)
 Diethylstilbestrol (DES) - DES is a synthetic non-steriodal compound that has estrogenic activity.
 It was used for over thirty years as a treatment to prevent miscarriage.
 In 1971, DES was linked to cervical and vaginal carcinomas in the female children of treated mothers.
 DES has also been used as a growth promoter in poultry and meat production and was linked to episodes of breast enlargement in young children who ate contaminated meat in Puerto Rico and Italy.
 Estrogens, particularly DES, may have significant immunosuppressive effects (Hadden 1986) DES has been shown to have immunotoxic effects on some components of the human immune system.
 The.
 natural killer cell system which is a primary defense against tumors and viruses is the most susceptible to DES.
 (Kalland 1986) The National Toxicology Program has reported altered immune function and resistance to infectious agents in mice exposed to DES.
 (NTP Annual Report 1985) Clinical observations on the prevalence of susceptibility to infectious agents during pregnancy also indicate an effect of female sex steroids on the human immune system.
 In addition to being a transplacental carcinogen, DES has also been associated with malformations of the genitalia in both male and female children exposed in utero.
 DES daughters have shown cellular and structural abnormalities in the vagina, cervix, uterus and Fallopian tubes.
 Studies have also confirmed abnormalities of the reproductive tract in DES sons such as undescended testicles and benign cysts.
 (DES Action 1986) 1986)
 It has been noted that the developing immune system is more susceptible to toxic effects in general and that this holds true for the effects of DES.
 In the mouse, exposure of the immature immune system to DES leads to persistent impairment of the immune system, particularly decreased natural killer cell activity.
 (Kalland 1986) 1986)
 Diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin) Evidence is accumulating that this anti-seizure medication may have significant immunosuppressive effects.
 (Hadden 1986) National Toxicology Program studies in mice exposed to diphenylhydantoin demonstrated a selective effect on immune function resulting in depressed serum IgA levels and altered bone marrow function.
 Researchers are trying to correlate these findings with the IgA deficiency and increased sinuopulmonary infection that occurs in humans on long-term diphenylhydantoin treatment (NTP 1984) 1984)
 A number of reports have suggested a relationship between diphenylhydantoin and the development of lymphadenopathy, lymphoma and Hodgkins Disease.
 There have also been reports of malignancies such as neuroblastoma occurring in children whose mothers received diphenylhydantoin during pregnancy.
 (PDR 1988) 1988)
 In addition to having immunosuppressive effects, diphenylhydantoin is also teratogenic to the developing fetus and has been associated with an increased incidence of congenital malformations, such as cleft lip/ palate and heart malformation, and a pattern of congenital malformations called Fetal Hydantoin Syndrome.
 The sequence of abnormalities in children whose mothers took diphenylhydantoin during pregnancy includes prenatal growth deficiency, microcephaly and mental deficiency.
 (PDR 1988) 1988)
 Antihistamines - Antihistamines are, by the very nature of their pharmacological activity, immunosuppressant.
 An allergic reaction occurs when a foreign antigen activates T-cells passing through the site of the allergic response.
 These activated T-cells stimulate B-cells to produce high levels of IgE antibodies.
 At the same time, the T-cells release chemotactic factors which attract basophils into the affected tissue.
 The basophils, bind with the newly produced IgE and when these cells come in contact with the allergen, they release stores of histamine, heparin and other mediators amplifying the allergic response.
 Antihistamines block the effects of histamine on blood vessels and smooth muscle, thus they help to suppress the body's reaction to a foreign antigen.
 Standard adverse reaction warnings on most antihistamines include many symptoms which are also characteristic of chemically-induced immune dysfunction:
 rash, photosensitivity, fatigue, dizziness, disturbed coordination, insomnia, tinnitus, paresthesia, neuritis, blurred vision, headache, gastrointestinal problems, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and so on.
 Like other immune modulators, antihistamines can also produce the paradoxical effects of sedation in some people, restlessness and excitation in others.
 (PDR 1988) 1988)
 Doxylamine succinate, an antihistamine in a number of over-the-counter products as well as the controversial morning sickness remedy Bendectin, has been associated with a statistically significant increase in acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia in children whose mothers took Bendectin for eleven weeks or more during pregnancy.
 (Robinson et al 1988) In 90-day chronic toxicity studies at the National Toxicology Program, doxylamine was associated with toxic lesions of the livers and parotid glands of mice and rats.
 (NTP 1986) 1986)
 Bendectin has been associated with limb reduction defects, heart defects, oral clefts and other serious birth defects in animal and human studies.
 (ABDC 1988) Other antihistamines, diphenhydramine (Benadryl), meclizine and cyclizine have also been associated with birth defects in animal and human studies.
 Marijuana and Alcohol - Abuse of marijuana or alcohol has been shown to contribute to impaired immune function and lowered resistance either directly or indirectly through an abnormal life style and malnutrition.
 (Dean 1984) Both substances have also been associated with adverse effects on the unborn.
 A pattern of congenital malformation called Fetal Alcohol Syndrome has been identified in the children of chronically alcoholic women.
 FAS may include growth and mental deficiency, microcephaly, short palpebral fissures and other anomalies of the skeleton and heart.
 (Smith 1982) Marijuana use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of childhood acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia.
 (Robinson 1989) 1989)
 Glycol Ethers - Ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (Methyl Cellusolve) and 2-ethoxyethanol (Cellusolve) are widely used industrial solvents for paint, inks, nitrocellulose, pigments and leather finishes.
 Immunological studies of solvent-exposed workers have shown a decrease in overall T-cells; a decrease in T-4 helper cells; and increase in natural killer cells and an increase in human B-lymphocytes.
 Similar changes in lymphocyte subpopulations are found in states of immunodeficiency and immunogenetic forms of aplastic anemia.
 (Denkhaus 1986) 1986)
 Bone marrow injury has been reported in a study of lithographers exposed to glycol ethers.
 (Cullen 1983) A syndrome called Chemically Acquired Immunodeficiency has also been reported in Silicon Valley workers exposed to glycol ethers.
 This pattern of illness includes abnormal T-cell function; flu-like symptoms; multiple allergic reactions to ink, perfume, gasoline, heating fuel and household chemicals; repeated infections; depression; gastrointestinal complaints; chronic headaches and fatigue; concentration, learning and memory difficulties and reproductive problems including miscarriage.
 (Spake 1986) 1986)
 NIOSH recommends that Methyl Cellusolve and Cellusolve be regarded in the workplace as having the potential to cause adverse reproductive effects, including toxic effects to the unborn if the mother is exposed during pregnancy.
 Even at the permissible exposure limits, these two glycol ethers produced damage to the reproductive systems of two species of test animals including testicular wasting, male infertility, and birth defects in the offspring of mothers exposed during pregnancy.
 (UAW 1986) Since thymic atrophy has been observed in animals exposed to glycol monomethyl ether, the National Toxicology Program has started studies to examine the consequences of exposure to this chemical during the development of the fetal immune system.
 (NTP 1986) 1986)
 Dioxin - 2, 3, 7, 8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is the prototype for certain isomers from several classes of halogenated aromatic compounds.
 Toxic responses to TCDD in animals include teratogenesis, wasting and thymic atrophy.
 Immunological studies have shown depressed antibody response, cell-mediated immunity and lymphoproliferative responses in association with increased susceptibility to pathogen and tumor challenge particularly in neonates of exposed mothers.
 (Hadden 1986) 1986)
 Studies in various animal and cell culture models indicate that TCDD's actions seem to focus on two target systems, the skin and the thymus resulting in altered patterns of growth and differentiation.
 This suggests that TCDD may be altering similar regulatory events in both cell targets.
 (Greenlee 1986) 1986)
 In culture, TCDD can suppress the formation of granulocyte-macrophage colonies and plaque forming cells.
 TCDD can also suppress proliferating cells of the immune system, including hematopoietic stem cells and B cells in adult mice.
 (Tucker 1986) Rodents exposed to TCDD during the perinatal period of immune system development have exhibited immunosupression characterized by thymic atrophy, suppressed-cell mediated immunity and increased susceptibility to infections.
 (Greenlee 1986) 1986)
 Studies of workers seventeen years after accidental exposure to dioxin have reported immune system alterations including increases in antinuclear antibodies and immune complexes in the peripheral blood of exposed workers and a significant increase in the number of natural killer cells.
 (Jennings ET al, 1988) 1988)
 Immunologic tests of dioxin-exposed residents of Quail Run Mobile Home Park in Missouri also revealed immune alterations characterized by a decreased ability to react to challenge with specific antigens.
 Clapp suggested that these findings indicate an association between long-term exposure to dioxin and depressed cell-mediated immunity.
 (Clapp et al.
 1990) 1990)
 Clapp also reported a study of 48 children from Seveso, Italy who were heavily exposed to dioxin.
 Their lymphocyte responses to selected allergens were significantly higher than the controls.
 (Clapp ET al, 1990) 1990)
 Malignancy is one possible outcome of chemical and viral immunosuppression.
 Higher rates of sarcomas and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have been previously reported in seriously immunodepressed individuals such as AIDS patients and renal transplant patients.
 (Zahm,1988) Hardell reported a significantly increased rate of soft-tissue sarcomas in populations exposed to dioxins in a case-control study.
 (Hardell 1990) A panel of scientists has recently reported a statistical association between TCDD contaminated Agent Orange exposure and the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, chloracne and other skin disorders; early liver disease and porphyria cutanea tarda, a metabolic disorder in Vietnam veterans.
 (AOSTF Report 1990) 1990)
 The Agent Orange panel also said there was enough evidence to suggest an association between Vietnam veterans' TCDD exposure and the development of Hodgkin's Disease, neurological and psychological problems, immunological abnormalities, a large number of cancers, reproductive difficulties and developmental problems in the veterans' children (AOSTF Report 1990) 1990)
 Epidemiological surveys have reported an association between paternal TCDD exposure and increases in several categories of birth defects in children including neural tube defects, heart defects and oral clefts.
 The Ranch Hand Study reported a doubling of birth defects in the children of Agent Orange exposed veterans.
 (Ranch Hand 1986) None of these studies, however, has measured the prenatal effects of TCDD which may be the most prevalent in veterans' children, i.e.
 the effects of TCDD on the development of the immune system.
 A report by the National Information System for Vietnam Veterans at the University of South Carolina has analyzed developmental disabilities in over 1,500 children of Vietnam veterans' served by the project to date.
 The most commonly reported conditions can be grouped into the area of immune response disorders including persistent skin rashes, multiple allergies, infections, chronic fevers, asthma, attention deficit disorders and learning disabilities.
 (Smith 1990) 1990)
 This apparent pattern of skin and immune system disorders seems consistent with information gained from animal models indicating that the skin and immune system are target organs for TCDD.
 Even the reported increases in learning and attention problems can be related to possible immunological dysfunction.
 A 1987 report to Congress on learning disabilities stated that research on the prenatal immune system may be important for understanding learning disabilities because of evidence in animals that prenatal immune disorders can affect brain development and result in behavior comparable to what is observed in learning disabled children.
 (LD Report to Congress 1987) In separate and collaborative studies, Galaburda and Geschwind have postulated a relationship between diseases of the immune system and learning disabilities.
 (Galaburda 1985, Geschwind 1985) Lahita has reported that 35% of the male offspring of mothers who suffer from the autoimmune disorder lupus have forms of learning disabilities or cognitive problems like stuttering, delayed speech or autism.
 Lahita said that this was the first study to show that learning and cognitive problems in children may be linked to both the development of the immune system and to intrauterine effects.
 (Lupus Footnotes 1989) 1989)
 Pesticides - The category pesticides includes insecticides, herbicides and fungicides.
 Since "cide" means to kill, it is readily apparent that these agents are lethal to various forms of life -- insect, plants and fungi.
 That this lethality may also extend to humans is becoming increasingly apparent especially in the area of damage to the immune system.
 Symptoms of a pesticide-weakened immune system include:
 skin rashes, nausea, fatigue, depression, leukemia, frequent infections and fever.
 The most immediately noticeable immune reaction to pesticide exposure is an increase in allergic reactivity often including multiple chemical hypersensitivity.
 People whose immunity is suppressed by pesticides may also be unable to fight off viral infections or may experience a reactivation of one or more of the herpes viruses.
 Immunological studies reveal that pesticide-exposure can cause a decrease in the number of B and Tcells.
 The ratio of T-4 to T-8 helper cells is often reversed similar to the immune abnormalities found in AIDS patients.
 (Legro 1988) 1988)
 (Austin 1989) CFIDS involves a pattern of symptoms including viral reactivation, immunological abnormalities, extreme fatigue, headaches, neurological and cognitive dysfunction, chronic sore throats and lymph node enlargement, muscle and join pain, neuritis, depression and mood swings and chronic infections.
 The rate of cancers - non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia and testicular cancer is also increased in pesticide-exposed agricultural workers and their children.
 A recent study has also shown that children risk a higher incidence of acute leukemia if their parents use pesticides in the home or garden.
 (Moses 1988) 1988)
 Pesticides may also be teratogenic to the developing fetus.
 A California study has reported a statistically significant increase in limb-reduction deformities in the children of mothers who lived in areas of high pesticide exposure.
 (Schwartz 1988) Two large chemical companies recently paid an out-of-court settlement to the family of a child born without any arms or legs.
 The mother had been exposed to teratogenic pesticides while working in the grape fields during pregnancy.
 (Moses 1988) 1988)
 A body of research is growing daily to suggest that many other environmental agents in addition to those discussed in this paper can have adverse effects on the human immune system.
 Since many of these substances are ubiquitous in our environment, we would expect an epidemic of immune disease, cancer and birth defects.
 There is some evidence to believe this may already be happening.
 One in every three Americans will develop cancer in their lifetime.
 As many as twelve million Americans are estimated to have Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome.
 Over 15% of all children suffer minor or major birth defects according to the largest epidemiological study to date.
 It has also been reported that the birth defect rate has doubled in the last twenty-five years.
 Yet, it is also clear that not everyone who is exposed to one of these potentially toxic agents will have an adverse outcome.
 There are obviously co-factors which can enhance the immunotoxic and teratogenic effects of xenobiotics.
 In an environmental health primer (Enviro-Health Primer) for seven counties in Florida, information is listed about suspected groups who may be at high risk when exposed to environmental pollutants due to developmental processes, genetic conditions, nutritional deficiencies, diseases and behavioral activities.
 Differences in genetic susceptibility are particularly important.
 For instance, the primer reports that among people of European ancestry, there are about 1 in 1,250 who are highly sensitive to the adverse effects of the broad category of anticholinesterase insecticides.
 Genetic vulnerability to hazardous chemicals has even become a condition for employment in the chemical industry which has been requiring genetic screening for such effects for the past fifteen years.
 (Help Almanac 1981) 1981)
 Nutritional deficiencies may be another key co-factor.
 Children with vitamin A deficiency are more susceptible to the effects of DDT, hydrocarbon carcinogens and PCBs.
 10% of women and 5% of men aged 30 to 60 who are deficient in dietary protein are at greater risk when exposed to DDT and other insecticides.
 (Enviro-Health Primer) Primer)
 The teratogenic effects of environmental immunotoxins may also be modulated by genetic factors and diet.
 For instance, an animal study of the pesticide Dinoseb clearly showed that its teratogenic effect is correlated to the quality of the diet.
 (Giavini et al, 1989) Other research has suggested that susceptibility to the neurotoxic effects of thalidomide may be genetically determined.
 (Kremer 1961) 1961)
 The prenatal and neonatal periods are characterized by immunoincompetence.
 Any toxic interference with the delicately balanced immune system during this period may have major consequences, much more so than in the adult.
 (Shoham 1986) Current research confirms that many immunotoxic agents also have teratogenic potential.
 One possible teratogenic outcome from prenatal exposure to immunotoxins may be impairment in the development of the immune system.
 This possible teratogenic outcome has not been addressed to any extent in current research nor has such an outcome been measured in any epidemiological studies of suspected immunotoxins to date.
 Since the consequences of immune incompetence include such serious outcomes as cancer, chronic illness, severe allergies and learning disabilities, it is critical that the new field of developmental immunotoxicology addresses these important issues as quickly as possible.

 conifer stump treatment to control annosus root disease disease
 Operational details:
 Target plants:
 Borax is used to control the fungus Heterobasidion annosum.
 The fungus often infects cut conifer stumps after thinning or cutting, and thedisease can spread from stumps to other trees.
 Mode of action:
 Borax inhibits the growth of fungi by preventing the production of spores.
 Borax is a contact, preventative fungicide.
 Method of application:
 Application is by granular shaker.
 Timing of application:
 Borax is applied to stumps as soon after felling as practical, within one day of cutting.
 Use rates:
 1 pound to 50 square feet of stump surface surface
 Use Precautions:
 Always read all of the information on the product label before using any pesticide.
 Read the label for application restrictions.
 Surface Water:
 Do not apply directly to water, or to areas where surface water is present or to intertidal areas below the mean high water mark.
 Do not contaminate water when disposing of equipment washwaters or rinsate.
 III.
 Environmental Effects/Fate Effects/Fate
 Soil:
 � Residual soil activity:
 Borax is generally active in the soil.
 Boron from borax is absorbed from the soil by plants.
 Boron is usually found in soils, and is an essential plant nutrient.
 Soil naturally contains boron at a concentration of 5 to 150 ppm.
 � Adsorption:
 Borax is adsorbed by the mineral portion of the soil.
 � Persistence and agents of degradation:
 Borax remains unchanged in the soil for varying lengths of time, depending on soil acidity and rainfall.
 The average persistence is 1 year or more.
 Borax is less persistent in acid soils and in areas with high rainfall.
 Under high rainfall conditions, borax may leach rapidly.
 Soil microorganisms do not break down borax.
 � Metabolites/degradation products and potential environmental effects:
 The main break-down product of borax in the soil is boron.
 Boron is found in most natural soils.
 Water:
 � Solubility:
 Borax is partially soluble in water.
 � Potential for leaching into ground-water:
 The potential for leaching is low.
 Borax is adsorbed to mineral particles in soil.
 Borax may leach more rapidly under high rainfall conditions.
 � Surface waters:
 The potential for surface water contamination with borax is low.
 Surface waters naturally contain low levels of boron.
 The average boron concentration in surface waters ranges from 0.001 mg/L to 0.1 mg/L.
 Air:
 � Volatilization:
 Borax does not evaporate.
 � Potential for byproducts from burning of treated vegetation:
 Major products from burning treated vegetation have not been identified.
 Borax is not flammable, and has been used as a fire retardant.
 IV.
 Ecological Effects Effects
 Non-target toxicity:
 � Soil microorganisms:
 At high levels, borax could be toxic to many soil microorganisms.
 � Plants:
 Borax and other boron compounds at high levels may kill plants.
 Borax may be used as a nonselective herbicide.
 However, boron is an essential nutrient for plants, and boron compounds (including borax) occur widely in nature.
 Boron is taken up from soil by plants in proportion to the amount of boron in the soil.
 Borax is also used in fertilizer formulations to supply boron, which is an essential plant nutrient.
 � Aquatic animals:
 Borax is practically nontoxic to fish, and practically nontoxic to aquatic invertebrate animals.
 It does not build up (bioaccumulate) in fish.
 Acute toxic level:
 species LC50 Source Table Table
 fish >1,000 ppm (Table II, Aquatic) Aquatic)
 water flea 133-226 ppm (Table II, Aquatic) Aquatic)
 � Terrestrial animals:
 Borax is practically nontoxic to birds and mammals.
 It is relatively nontoxic to bees.
 Relatively high concentrations of boron compounds are toxic to insects, and borax is used for insect control in some cases.
 Acute toxic level:
 species LD50 Source Table Table
 quail >2510 mg/kg (Table II, Avian) Avian)
 bee >362 ppm --- ---
 � Threatened and endangered species:
 Borax may be a hazard to endangered plant species if it is applied to areas where they live.
 V.
 Toxicology Data Data
 Acute toxicity:
 � Acute oral toxicity:
 The acute oral LD50 for borax was 5,400 mg/kg in male rats and 5,000 in female rats.
 (Toxicity Category IV, Table I, Oral) Oral)
 � Acute dermal toxicity:
 The acute dermal (skin) LD50 for borax was >2,000 mg/kg in rabbits.
 (Toxicity Category III, Table I, Dermal) Dermal)
 � Primary irritation score:
 In rabbits, 0.5 grams of borax did not cause skin irritation.
 (Toxicity Category IV, Table I, Skin irritation) irritation)
 � Primary eye irritation:
 Borax was a severe eye irritant in rabbits (Toxicity Category I, Table I, Eye irritation) irritation)
 � Acute inhalation:
 The EPA has not required inhalation studies for borax.
 Chronic toxicity:
 � Carcinogenicity:
 In a 2 year feeding study in rats, borax was not found to be carcinogenic.
 An EPA review has classified the related compound boric acid as a Group E carcinogen (evidence of non-carcinogenicity for humans).
 � Developmental:
 In studies in rats and mice given the related compound boric acid during pregnancy, there was no effect on development at 0.1% in the feed.
 � Reproduction:
 In a three generation feeding study in rats, adverse reproductive effects were seen when the feed contained 1.03% borax.
 The reproductive organs in males and females were affected.
 Fertility was reduced.
 � Mutagenicity:
 Laboratory studies of mutagenicity with borax have been negative.
 Hazard:
 Borax is not classified as an agent which causes cancer, genetic damage, or birth defects.
 Studies have indicated that chronic exposure to borax may cause reproductive damage and infertility.
 VI.
 Human Health Effects Effects
 Acute toxicity (poisoning):
 Reported effects:
 Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
 In children, swallowing 5 to 10 grams can cause shockand death.
 Borax is rapidly absorbed through damaged skin.
 Chronic toxicity:
 Reported effects:
 Chronic exposure to borax caused chronic eczema in industrial workers.
 Workers chronically exposed to borax dust developed respiratory irritation.
 Symptoms of chronic poisoning include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, digestive disturbances, and a rash.
 Potential for adverse health effects from contacting or consuming treated vegetation, water or animals:
 Insufficient information available.
 Potential for adverse health effects from inert ingredients contained in the formulated product:
 Because of concern for human health and the environment, the the
 U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced its policy on inerts of toxicological concern (Lists 1 and 2) in the Federal Register on April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305).
 The intent of this policy is to encourage the use in pesticide products of the least toxic inert ingredients available.
 EPA's strategy for the implementation of this policy included the development of lists of inert ingredients according to toxicity.
 The toxicity categories for the lists of inert ingredients are:
 � List 1 - Inerts of toxicological concern concern
 � List 2 - Potentially toxic inerts/high priority for testing testing
 � List 3 - Inerts of unknown toxicity for which there is little concern that they will be shown to be toxic toxic
 � List 4A - Minimal risk inert ingredients ingredients
 � List 4B - Inert ingredients for which the EPA has sufficient information to conclude that their current use patterns in pesticide products will not adversely affect public health and the environment.
 For pesticides containing List 1 inerts, the EPA has given the pesticide registrant the opportunity to reformulate the product to remove the List 1 inerts.
 If the registrant chooses not to reformulate the product, then the List 1 inerts must be identified on the product label.
 For List 2 inerts, the EPA is monitoring ongoing testing and gathering existing information on the potential adverse effects of these chemicals to determine if further regulatory action is required.
 The EPA has no particular regulatory plans for List 3 and List 4 inerts.
 The Forest Service will incorporate new data on inerts into updated fact sheets as it becomes available.
 Sporax, the formulation for forestry use, does not contain any inert ingredients.
 Health effects of exposure to formulated products:
 The effects of exposure to the Sporax formulation would be the same as for borax.
 Health effects associated with other formulations:
 Some formulations of borax for other uses also contain other pesticides, such as bromacil or monouron.
 The information in this fact sheet only applies to formulations in which borax is the only active ingredient.
 Consult other fact sheets for information on the other pesticides.
 Health effects associated with contaminants:
 No contaminants have been identified.
 Health risk management procedures:
 The Forest Service has evaluated health effects data in the development of both pesticide background statement documents and environmental impact statements for pesticide use on forest lands.
 These health effects evaluations have taken into consideration the potential for both worker and public exposure from Forest Service operations.
 This information has been used in assessing health risks and consequently in formulating protective measures to reduce risk to forest workers and to the public.
 Section VII of this fact sheet, Safety Precautions, provides guidance for the safe handling and use of borax.
 VII.
 Safety precautions:
 Signal word and definition:
 Sporax - DANGER - HARMFUL IF SWALLOWED.
 Protective precautions for workers:
 Applicators and handlers must wear long-sleeved shirt and long pants, shoes, socks and waterproof gloves.
 Wash thoroughly after handling.
 The Sporax formulation is exempt from the Worker Protection Standard because it is applied to a harvested portion which is not used for food, feed, or fiber.
 Medical treatment procedures (antidotes):
 If swallowed, get medical attention immediately.
 If medical advice is not available, induce vomiting.
 If in eyes, flush with plenty of water.
 Get medical attention if irritation develops and persists.
 If on skin, remove clothing and wash skin with soap and water.
 If inhaled, remo ve victim to fresh air.
 In case of emergency, call your local poison control center for advice.
 Handling, storage, and disposal:
 Do not contaminate water, food, or feed by storage or disposal.
 Do not store where children or animals may gain access.
 Open burning and dumping are prohibited.
 Pesticide that cannot be used or chemically reprocessed should be disposed of according to procedures approved by federal, state or local disposal authorities.
 Borax is stable at normal temperatures.
 Borax is not flammable, and may act as a fire retardant.
 Improper disposal of excess pesticide, spray mixture, or rinsate is a violation of Federal law.
 If pesticide wastes cannot be disposed of by use according to label instructions, contact your State Pesticide or Environmental Control Agency, or the Hazardous Waste representative at the nearest EPA Regional Office for guidance.
 Emergency (spill) hazards and procedures:
 In case of a spill, dike to prevent borax from entering drains, sewers or water courses.
 Shovel or sweep up spilled material into a container.
 Reclaim for salvage value or dispose of in accordance with federal, state and local regulations.
 In case of a large spill, call CHEMTREC at 1-800-424-9300 for advice.

 Borax As a Pesticide | eHow.com http://www.ehow.com/facts_6037918_borax-pesticide.html#ixzz1eVr1P4Ob http://www.ehow.com/facts_6037918_borax-pesticide.html#ixzz1eVr1P4Ob
 What is the pesticide recipe using Borax?
 We have an ant infestation in our apartment.
 They're coming in through the door in droves! We've purchased Borax because of it's supposed insecticide uses.
 There are 2 cats, 2 rabbits and sometimes a dog living here so we need the recipe to be animal friendly.
 Unfortunately we can't find the right recipe for a paste in order to apply the Borax.
 You don't just mix the stuff with water and go, right?
 Can someone give me a good site or their own paste recipe for it's use as an insecticide?
 Also, where are the best places to apply the paste?
 Borax is quite popular online these days.
 It's in recipes for everything from children's craft concoctions to alternative cleaning products and homemade baby wipe solutions.
 Before you use it, though, make sure you know all the facts.
 Borax, which is also known as Boric Acid and is sold under the brand name "20 Mule Team," is often touted as safe and natural.
 While it is a naturally occurring mineral, that doesn't mean it is without dangers.
 Borax is often recommended as a "safe" pesticide, fungicide and cleaner, but it is officially classified as a poison.
 Government sites recommend that people who work with Borax use gloves and handle it with caution.
 Studies have linked it to reproductive problems in some lab animals, as well as a host of serious disorders at higher levels.
 Boric acid is an acute eye and respiratory tract irritant, which is quite toxic if ingested.
 In addition, it is unavailable in parts of Europe because of concerns that it caused birth defects and problems with the reproductive organs of children.
 It is recommended that pregnant women and children in particular do not have exposure to Borax.
 Here are some medical and U.S.
 government fact sheets about its toxicity:
 http://www.strobel.com/studies.htm http://www.strobel.com/studies.htm
 http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0410.htm http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0410.htm
 http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002485.htm http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002485.htm
 http://www.greenfootsteps.com/borax-information.html http://www.greenfootsteps.com/borax-information.html
 Also, It might be helpful to look at 20 Mule Team's MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet), which they are required to provide.
 You can view it here.
 Note that they specifically say:
 "Nonetheless, the following effects have been reported for a component, sodium borate, and boric acid.
 Sodium borate upon entry into the body becomes boric acid." acid."
 Also refer to section 3 (on page 2) where the company itself says:
 Based on our hazard evaluation, the following chemical substance(s) in this product have been identified as hazardous.
 INGREDIENT INGREDIENT
 Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate Decahydrate
 The health and safety warnings are also listed on the MSDS.
 Everybody can make their own decisions.
 I simply think it's a bad idea to make craft concoctions for small children to handle (and possibly stick in their mouths) considering all of the health risks.
 It's important to remember that many products that we use around the house are just as harmful.
 However, most of them aren't included in recipes we give to toddlers! toddlers!
 Yes, we like goop as much as the next folks.
 After reading about the risks, though, we decided to make some nice scented play dough instead.
 Boric acid (borax and boron-containing salts) is a low-toxicity mineral with insecticidal, fungicidal, and herbicidal properties.
 It does not evaporate or volatilize into the air or pose the considerable health concerns associated with synthetic pesticides; however it can still pose health hazards and should be used with care.
 As with any pesticide, keep boric acid pesticide products out of reach of children and only use it in locations where it will not come in contact with people or animals, such as in cracks and crevices, behind counters, and in baseboards.
 While boric acid is somewhat slower acting than the synthetic pesticides, like chlorpyrifos, diazinon, or pyrethrins, it is highly effective over a long period of time.
 Use and Mode of Action Action
 Registered in 1983 for control of cockroaches, ants, grain weevils and several beetles, it has also been used as an herbicide along rights-of-way and as a fungicide for citrus, and as a wood preservative/fire retardant, and even as an insect repellent in insulation.
 As an insecticide, boric acid acts as a stomach poison for ants, cockroaches, silverfish and termites, and as abrasive to the insects exoskeleton.
 As an herbicide, boric acid causes desiccation or interrupts photosynthesis in plants.
 Boric acid may be used either in a bait formulation containing a feed attractant or as a dry powder.
 The powder may be injected into cracks and crevices, where it forms a fine layer of dust.
 Insects travel through the boric acid, which adheres to their legs.
 When the insects groom themselves, they then ingest the poison, which causes death three to ten days later of starvation and dehydration.
 As long as the material is not allowed to become wet, its continuous presence ensures that hatching insects, which sprays commonly spare, are exposed and die.
 Many insecticidal formulations can be effective for more than a year.
 Toxicity Toxicity
 While exposure to boric acid has been linked to adverse health effects, experts agree that careful application offers a safe and effective alternative without the indoor air problems associated with sprays.
 Boron is a naturally-occurring element in the earth�s crust and background levels even circulate in the human bloodstream.
 Boric acid�s exposure risks are minimal because of its method of application.
 EPA considers boric acid as a moderately acutely toxic due to acute effects including oral and dermal toxicity, and eye and skin irritation.
 EPA�s reregistration document states that a subchronic borax feeding study using dogs resulted in blood and metabolism disorders as well as effects to the testes, endocrine system, brain weight, and size ratios among various organs and glands.
 In chronic oncogenicity studies using mice, rats and beagle dogs, boric acid and borax were found not to be carcinogenic; however, testicular effects and decreases in body weight resulted at high dose levels.
 EPA has classified boric acid as a �Group E� carcinogen, indicating that it shows �evidence of noncarcinogenicity� for humans.
 In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies using rats, mice and rabbits, maternal liver and kidney effects and decreased weight gain as well as decreased fetal body weights were observed.
 In two studies, at the highest dose levels, no litters were produced.
 Prenatal mortality occurred at the highest dose levels in the rabbit study.
 Boric acid does not cause mutagenicity (U.S.
 EPA 1993).
 Applicators and others in treatment areas may be exposed to boric acid and its sodium salts during or after application.
 However, there is no reasonable expectation that these pesticide uses may constitute a hazard or risk to people involved in, or near to, handling or application activities.
 Proper care and adhering to label directions and precautions should reduce exposure and any associated risk (U.S.
 EPA 1993).
 Ecological Effects Effects
 Boric acid is practically nontoxic to birds, fish, aquatic invertebrates, and relatively nontoxic to beneficial insects.
 It�s noncrop herbicidal use may harm endangered or threatened plants, and therefore EPA is requiring three phytotoxicity studies to assess these risks (U.S.
 EPA 1993).
 Effectiveness Effectiveness
 An EPA assessment of a boric acid pilot pest control program conducted at the U.S.
 Army�s Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland found that boric acid was both more economical and more effective than monthly spray treatment.
 At least one study has shown that the combination of heat, 110 degree F for two hours with boric acid, will increase the speed at which the German cockroach is killed.
 The term �borax� is used to refer both to a mineral and to a refined compound with numerous applications.
 The mineral takes the form of colorless to white soft crystals, which can sometimes be tinged with brown, yellow, or green.
 When struck against another material, borax leaves a crumbly white streak.
 The substance is also known as sodium tetraborate or disodium tetraborate, and it has been known to humans for thousands of years.
 The mineral is a chemical compound of the element boron, and the chemical formula for borax is Na2B4O7*10H2O.
 The word �borax� comes from a Persian word, burak, which was used to refer to borax and other borate salts in the Middle East, picked up by the Romans, and adopted by the Middle English.
 Borax and related salts were used in the preservation of both food and mummies, as well as to make pottery glazes in China and as a cleaning material.
 In Medieval Europe, borax was used as a flux in soldering, to scour metal before it was welded together.
 Borax is still used for similar purposes today, although it is more heavily refined for purity.

 While borax is not violently toxic, it can cause skin reactions.
 Ingestion is also not advised, as even small amounts are not beneficial to human health.
 Around the house, borax can be useful for cleaning, laundry brightening, and as an insecticide or pesticide.
 Borax is also used in the manufacture of fire retardants, antiseptics, and fungicides.
 In the laboratory, borax may be used as a buffer for chemical reactions, since it is a non-reactive base and it will keep chemical solutions stable.
 Naturally occurring borax has a high percentage of water.
 As the water evaporates, the borax becomes more white and crumbly.
 If allowed to dehydrate, borax will turn into tincalconite.
 When refined for use, borax is usually broken down and mixed with water, along with a catalyst which will cause the borax to dissolve.
 Pure crystals of borax will reform, and be ready for packaging or further refining with other chemicals.
 Kernite, another chemical compound which contains boron, is also refined into borax.
 When mixed with sulfuric acid, borax becomes boric acid.
 Boric acid is used in numerous industrial applications, including cleaning and preservation.
 Boric acid is also used as a mild antiseptic, and as an eye solution for people experiencing eye irritation.
 It also marketed as an alternative insecticide, since it is more gentle than some chemical compounds.
 Product description description
 Borax and boric acid are derived from boron, a naturally occurring element in soil, rocks and water.
 Pesticides with borax or boric acid as the active ingredient are used in the garden as insecticides.
 They are available in powder, liquid or trap form.
 Manufacturers often add such baits as sweet liquid or peanut butter.
 Target pests (depending on the manufacturer) manufacturer)
 Products with borax or boric acid as the active ingredient may be used to control ants and earwigs.
 How it works works
 Borax and boric acid act as stomach poisons when eaten by insects.
 Death occurs a few days later.
 NB:
 Bait formulations rely on trophallaxis, the exchange of food among ants.
 After finding and eating the poisoned bait, ants take it back to the colony to share.
 The entire colony is affected after several days.
 Hence the importance of not crushing any ants that have visited the bait.
 Application Application
 Powder formulations formulations
 Spread a thin layer of the powder along insects' routes (at the base of foundations and walls, along doorsills, etc.).
 Avoid damp or wet locations, because the powder is effective only when dry.
 Bait formulations formulations
 Liquid:
 In the garden, apply along insect routes or near ant nests (some manufacturers recommend placing the insecticide on a piece of wax paper).
 Traps:
 Place traps along insect routes or near ant nests.
 In most cases, you will need to punch holes in the trap.
 Never remove the lid.
 Precautions Precautions
 The product may irritate the skin and eyes, so it is best to wear gloves, long sleeves and pants and goggles when applying it.
 It is best to wear a mask when applying a powder formulation, to avoid inhaling the pesticide.
 Some products may contain peanut butter, and may be hazardous for people with allergies.
 It is best not to apply it on windy or rainy days, to keep it from drifting or rinsing off.
 Avoid applying powder or liquid formulations near plant roots.
 Borax and boric acid can cause plants to dry out and/or interfere with photosynthesis.
 Do not use near any body of water or wetland, or dump any pesticide or rinse your equipment there, as this will contaminate the water.
 Never dump pesticides down sewers.
 Keep out of reach of children.
 Borax is a natural compound with powerful dehydrating affects and a wide range of applications as a preservative and pesticide.
 Borate-treated wood can resist infestations and rot for up to 30 years and the same borax powder you find at your grocery store is a cheap and environmentally safe insecticide.

 Function Function
 As a desiccant, borax dehydrates organisms that carry the powder back to their nests and contaminate the food supply of the colony within two weeks.
 Features Features
 Borax is considered a low-toxicity insecticide for silverfish, termites, cockroaches and ants.
 It also works as an herbicide and fungicide, yet is practically non-toxic to humans, animals, fish and birds.
 Potential Potential
 You can sprinkle loose powder under and around the house or leave traps of cotton balls soaked with borax and sugar in cracks and crevices.
 Treat wood and baseboards with a boric acid solution to protect against all types of infestations.
 Time Frame Frame
 The United States Forestry Service uses the borax product, Sporax, to treat freshly cut logs and stumps to ward off pests and rot.
 Warning Warning
 While Borax is considered a safe pesticide in comparison with other chemicals, it can cause nausea vomiting and abdominal pain and can cause shock and death in children if consumed in doses of more than 5 grams.

 Opinion & Information on Boric Acid Acid
 By Michael R.
 Cartwright, Sr.
 (Michael R.
 Cartwright, Sr.
 is a third generation licensed professional in the fields of structural pest control and building construction and is also licensed in agriculture pest control.
 His qualifications are too extensive to print but are available on request from The Reporter.) Reporter.)
 Over the past years I have seen, in many homes and restaurants, boric acid covering everything.
 Carpets, floors, toys and furniture, in kitchen cabinets, on counter tops and tables, in refrigerators, clothing, etc.
 Why?
 Because environmentalists, helped by an uninformed news media, tell them to.
 Why don't the news media also explain the possible dangers of applying something not normally found in the home environment, that you or your animals will come in direct contact with?
 I'm writing this article even though a California environmentalist group advised me not to say anything against boric acid and that I would pay dearly for only trying to mislead the public.
 My company uses a lot of boric acid, but not as described above.
 Under an OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, based on animal chronic toxicity studies of inorganic borate chemicals, boric acid and/or borates are Hazardous Materials.
 California has identified boric acid as a hazardous waste.
 The above information is taken from Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) 25-80-2320 (Section 2 and 13) supplied by U.S.
 Borax Inc.
 (the major supplier of borax to many industries).
 The National Academy of Sciences reports that children may be uniquely sensitive to chemicals and pesticide residues because of their rapid tissue growth and development.
 Most laboratory tests are performed on fully grown adult laboratory animals.
 On page 312 of the National Academy of Sciences' report Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children (under the section entitled "Non-dietary Exposure to Pesticides") boric acid is cited as one of the pesticides/fungicides that can induce adverse skin reactions such as contact dermatitis and hyperkeratosis with dermal contact of treated surfaces.
 Boric acid and/or borates are important and promising pesticides and fungicides, for my industry as well as for the general homeowner, for the control of fungus, termites, roaches and other insects as well as a wood preservative.
 Using appropriate application methods, boric acid and/or borates can be safe and long lasting pesticides and fungicides without having any negative side effects on the environment.
 Boric acid is generally known as a desiccant; in other words, it kills by removing the moisture from the body of the target pests, causing severe dehydration which will affect electrolyte metabolism with the potential of metabolic acidosis.
 In fact, boric acid is a stomach poison normally ingested, along with the fact that it can also enter the blood by inhalation.
 Boric acid is an acid.
 Acid will decrease the pH level with the possible side effects of renal, respiratory, and cardiovascular failure.
 Symptoms and signs of boric acid poisoning are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dysphagia, cold sweats, dyspnea, muscular debility, scarlatinal eruptions, subnormal temperature, cardiac weakness, cyanosis, coma, collapse, etc.
 Boric acid is 3 parts hydrogen, 1 part boron, and 3 parts oxygen.
 Recently U.S.
 Borax discovered that boric acid contains traces of arsenic.
 Before California Prop 65 there were few, if any, human studies on boric acid.
 When human studies were requested from U.S.
 Borax they said they were unable to supply us with any at that time.
 But in the late 1980's they had started doing new and extensive toxicity tests on rats and mice as a result of California Prop 65.
 As a result of these tests, they discovered a decrease in sperm count and the stopping of fetal and embryonic development in rats and mice.
 In early 1993, U.S.
 Borax had asked for, and has received, additional time to complete their laboratory studies from the State of California.
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has adopted a "de minimus" policy, which accepts that zero is not absolute, but a very, very small amount.
 But environmental groups protested the EPA policy, and the U.S.
 Ninth Circuit Court in California struck down the de minimus clause, thus establishing zero as absolute zero.
 Boric acid is a substance of chemical contained traces of arsenic,  which is known to the state of california to cause cancer.
 U.S.
 Borax was able to use the EPA de minimus policy, which accepts that zero is not absolute, but very, very small to remove arsenic from its Material Safety Data Sheet.
 I personally do not see any risk with the trace amount of arsenic at 1 part per million in boric acid and/or borates if used in an appropriate application method.
 But, not where there will be constant direct contact.
 Others in the pesticide manufacturing industry have found that boric acid is an effective and reliable long term pesticide.
 Consider the fact that the environmentalist groups approved of its use, contrary to their stand on the EPA de minimus policy.
 When they discovered a possible decrease in sperm count and no development of the egg capsule or ovum plus the stopping of fetal and embryonic development in roaches with the potential to similarly affect other insects, this made it the perfect pesticide, and with the blessings of the environmen- talists.
 Those in the fungicide and wood preservative manufacturing industries discovered that boric acid and/or borates are effective and reliable long term fungicides and preservatives.
 When wood was treated with boric acid and/or borates and then placed in a damp and warm area, the ideal environment for fungus growth you would have no fungus growth.
 These chemicals also work as a termiticide (prevents and/or kills termites and other wood destroying insects) -- unlike other fungicides and preservatives, which would also break down.
 Boric acid and/or borates are derived from natural elements, therefore they do not break down readily.
 When boric acid and/or borates are used as fungicides and preservatives, they serve as a growth regulator rather than a desiccant.
 Fungi are plants that contain no chlorophyll.
 Therefore, they cannot make their own food and so they must have an outside source of food, in this case wood.
 There are four requirements for fungus growth; first is food, such as cellulose and lignin which is contained in all wood; second is air; third is warmth; and, fourth is moisture.
 I do not wish to see the loss of boric acid and/or borates as we have seen in the past the loss of so many other fine pesticides, due to improper methods of application, which in many cases unnecessarily exposed people to hazardous chemicals.
 Boric Acid is one of the safest pesticides if used correctly.
 THIS IS NOT AN INDICTMENT OF U.S.
 BORAX for they have always been forthright about providing any new information regarding any of their products.
 U.S.
 Borax has the only correct Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) on boric acid that I have seen to date.
 Most, if not all, other manufacturers of pesticides that contain boric acid have incomplete information contained in their MSDSs about boric acid and/or borates.
 When talking with U.S.
 Borax about use of their product, technical grade boric acid, for reformulating or repackaging into registered products, they do not necessarily approve of anyone using boric acid in any manner inconsistent with their original label.
 But there is nothing they can do if its recommended use is inconsistent with its own original label when it has been re-labeled by still others.
 U.S.
 Borax indicated that if they were to try to stop reformulators or repackagers from registering products with recommendations that were inconsistent with their product label on boric acid, that would be considered restraint of trade.
 It is entirely up to the discretion of the EPA to oversee how a pesticide is labeled.
 Broadcast application of boric acid (to cover entire areas or surfaces) is not one of U.S.
 Borax's recommended methods of application on its registered label.
 Based on U.S.
 Borax's label, broadcast application would not be the normal occupational exposure and not what I would consider the normal human exposure to boric acid.
 Limiting the use (application methods and locations) of pesticides and/or reducing of unnecessary human and/or animal contact with pesticides regardless of their perceived safety is of the utmost importance.
 Many illnesses may be directly related to a pesticide or chemical but because of its perceived safety could be overlooked.
 Because Michael Cartwright feels that the information provided to The Reporter would be helpful in understanding his opinion on the use of boric acid and derivative products for pest control, he has included additional supporting information relating to the basic principles of toxicity testing.
 This information will be presented as Part II of this article in the next issue of the Reporter.
 What I actually received from Mr.
 Cartwright is a presentation nearly an inch thick of background information, including MSDSs on various commonly used flea control products and relevant reference articles.) articles.)
 The term �borax� refers to both a mineral and a refined boron compound with many uses.
 You may have also heard it called by the names sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, or disodium tetraborate.
 Borax typically takes the form of a white powder made up of smaller colorless crystals that easily dissolve in water.
 Read below for more information.
 Borax is not just an ingredient in pesticides pesticides
 Borax has a wide variety of applications; it�s most common being that of a cleaning agent.
 Borax can also be found in cosmetics, household detergents and enamel glazes.
 It is also used as a fire retardant, anti-fungal compound, a texturing agent for cooking, and creates the base for other compounds containing boron.
 Borax as a Pesticide Pesticide
 Insecticides containing borax target ants, cockroaches, silverfish, and fleas.
 It also works as a fungicide and herbicide.
 Mode of Action Action
 When insects ingest Borax it immediately begins to dehydrate them, resulting in eventual death.
 However the process is not so quick as to prevent them from first carrying the substance with them back to their colonies where it contaminates the food supply.
 Toxicity Toxicity
 Borax is considered a low-toxicity insecticide for its target pests, yet is practically non-toxic to humans, pets and other animals.
 While it is considered a safe pesticide compared to others, it can cause adverse side affects if consumed in doses of more than 5 grams so Always read the product label before applying.
 Borax is a natural compound with powerful dehydrating affects and a wide range of applications as a preservative and pesticide.

 Borax is considered safe as a pesticide as it does not produce harmful vapors.
 It should not be ingested and care should be taken when using borax near pets and animals.
 A homemade insecticide can be made using borax and other household items to kill pests like ants, roaches and silverfish (see references 1, 2 and 3).

 Using Borax as Bait Bait
 The Sonora Environmental Research Institute recommends using mixing equal parts of honey, artificial sweetener and borax into a paste to use as an insecticide bait.
 Place the mixture in small bowls or on small strips of cardboard in areas where insects are present.
 Insects such as ants, cockroaches, termites and silverfish are attracted to the sweet bait and they will carry it back to their nests.
 When the insects ingest the borax, they are poisoned and begin to die by dehydration.
 Take special care when creating bait traps using borax.
 Keep bait in areas away from children and dogs since borax is moderately toxic when ingested and can cause skin irritation, according to the Safety Source for Pest Management.
 Check areas where you have placed bait frequently and replenish when needed.
 Borax works slowly, so continue to replace the bait as needed until insects no longer appear (see references 1,2 and 3).
 Using Borax as Dry Powder Insecticide Insecticide
 Borax may also be used as a dry powder instead of a bait.
 Instead of spraying for insects using a toxic insecticide, dry borax powder may be sprinkled in areas where insects are present.
 Place borax powder on drop-down cabinet tops, as recommended by the Sonora Environmental Research Institute.
 Borax should also be placed into cracks and crevices where insects travel, according to the Safety Source for Pest Management.
 By applying borax powder where insects frequently travel, the insects will pick up the powder on their bodies.
 Borax works to scratch the exoskeleton of insects, leading to death by dehydration.
 The insects also carry the powder back to their nests, where they spread the borax.
 The powder is also able to dehydrate and kills insect eggs that have not hatched.
 Ensure that areas treated with dry borax do not become wet as the powder is not effective when wet.
 Replace the powder as needed.
 The Safety Source for Pest Management suggests that an application of borax will continue to be effective for a year.
 Keep borax away from children and pets (see references 1,2 and 3).

 If I asked you to roll around and/or climb on concertina (razor) barb wire - you would think the request absurd - yet ants can climb all over it without harm - you can powder your baby's bottom with talcum powder, but ants will leave an area where talcum is sprinkled.
 Volatile, synthetic pesticide poisons were basically invented to kill man - why try using them on insects?
 Unlike the "professional" pest control industry that only has one "tool" to control pest problems -volatile, synthetic pesticide poisons - we want you to begin to understand my "tool box".
 The following are only a few of my favorite things or "tools" or Pestisafes� to control or repel the species of pesticide resistant insects that annoy man and/of that damage his crops and/or the other nuisance wildlife that "bug" him.
  You either love your fellow man or you love money and power more.
 1.
 BAITS - Why use baits?
 Make the pests help do their own pest control by taking the toxin where it will kill the others others
 No or low odor odor
 Little or no volatility volatility
 Low % active ingredient ingredient
 Low volume application application
 High % mortality mortality
 Good service life life
 Safety - less risk - Caution:
 Any time you make a toxic bait (even with borax or food-grade DE) add green food color to the bait and note on it clearly - "Not for human consumption." consumption."
 Baiting for German cockroaches:
 Perform a thorough inspection.
 You will need a "red or yellow" flashlight at night.
 Put bait as close as you can to the cockroaches.
 Make it easy for them! Bait detection zone is about about
 12"; apply small amounts of bait in many places.
 Use enough bait to feed the entire cockroach population.
 For example:
 A baiting program wasn't "working", and the PCO still saw cockroaches.
 But when he checked, the PCO found the bait was all gone.
 He didn't use enough bait to feed/kill off all the population.
 Do a follow-up evaluation on any bait's performance - 10 - 14 days.
 Caution:
 If you kill cockroaches and they die inside your building, you will breathe them in a few months.
 Termite baits are just starting to be introduced and be used.
 The best termite bait station is the made of rolled cardboard and described in The Best Control II�.
 A termite bait station to be effective must be properly placed near the structure, but away from soils contaminated with termiticide poisons.
 Virtually any diluted antibiotic or salt spray will quickly kill a feeding colony of termites.
 As EPA and environmental concerns limit traditional termiticides, people will rely more on baits.
 Trying to get a feel for the colony is important for treatments, esp.
 baits.
 Worker termites and supplemental queens are the ones to key on with your bait treatments.
 Placement is important.
 Use �% - 1% disodium octoborate tetrahydrate or table salt or borax as the maximum amount of toxin in your (cardboard or cellulose insulation) baits, or use Flagyl� or goldenseal which also helps to kill the protozoa and bacteria in their guts.
 2.
 BENEFICIALS - Beneficial insects are classified into two major groups:
 1) Predators that attack, kill, and eat their prey and 2) Parasites which lay eggs in or on a host which later hatch and kill the host.
 Pathogens are a third group of beneficial organisms e.g., bacteria, viruses, and/or fungi which invade the host and cause disease.
 Insects, nematodes, BT, milky spore, decollate snails, microbial fungicides, streptomycin bacteria, lacewings, predatory mites, lady bugs, praying mantis, earwigs, yellow jackets, and/or predator wasps, mealy bug destroyers, etc.
 The costs are varied and the types of beneficials extremely varied, e.g., the lacewing is not mobile at the time of application and must be applied directly to the infested area, while adult lady bugs can be released to find their own target pests, but lady bugs are captured and not raised and may be out of stock.
 There are many suppliers and, as with most trends, you can expect more to come on line.
 Many of the companies who supply beneficials also employ consultants.
 These consultants typically have a wealth of knowledge regarding specific traits and tendencies that each beneficial is capable of demonstrating.
 The 5 listed below are just a fraction of what is out there:
 Though often touted as a green cleaning ingredient, borax isn't really a healthy, eco-friendly alternative, according to an environmental health scientist.

 Alisha Vargas/Flickr Vargas/Flickr
 Many MNNers already shun conventional cleaning products, most of which contain unnecessarily harsh and potentially harmful chemicals that are undisclosed on the ingredient list, if a list�s even provided.
 Instead, green cleaning advocates often mix their own DIY cleaning products from safer ingredients like lemon juice, vinegar, baking soda and borax.
 If you use all four of the ingredients I just mentioned above, I�ve got bad news.
 Borax isn�t so green and healthy, according to the well-respected environmental health nonprofit, Environmental Working Group.
 �Borax:
 Not the green alternative it�s cracked up to be� is the title of EWG senior scientist Rebecca Sutton�s post.
 What�s wrong with good old borax, which environmentalists have hailed as an excellent ingredient for both green cleaners and eco pesticides?
 Borax is linked to hormone disruption � which could cause sexual health problems for both men and women.
 Writes Sutton:
 Men working in boric acid-producing factories have a greater risk of decreased sperm count and libido.
 According to EPA�s safety review of these pesticides, chronic exposure to high doses of borax or boric acid causes testicular atrophy in male mice, rats and dogs.
 Animal studies reviewed by the EPA indicate that while the female reproductive system is less sensitive to borax, exposure to it can also lead to reduced ovulation and fertility.
 Borax and boric acid can cross the placenta, affecting fetal skeletal development and birth weight in animal studies of high-dose exposures.
 In addition, borax can cause short-term irritations for people who accidentally inhale or ingest the stuff.
 If this bad borax news is new to you, you�re not alone.
 Other MNN bloggers have recommended it as a green cleaning ingredient and gone so far as dedicate a whole post to its natural cleaning power.
 On the other hand, since borax has also been hailed as a roach killer, some environmentalists have avoided using the stuff in everyday cleaners, using borax only to kill pests as needed.
 Even if daily cleaning with borax should be discouraged, is borax still a greener pesticide option � compared to conventional bug killing options like Raid?
 I asked EWG�s Sutton this question, and her short answer is � it depends.
 Here�s her long answer:
 I have not yet done a rigorous comparison of home use insecticides, so it�s hard for me to say if borax is the least toxic option.
 Obviously, any non-pesticidal ways to control roaches etc.
 are important (e.g.
 removing food sources, patching holes/cracks from which the bugs enter, using sticky traps), but sometimes they�re not enough.
 I certainly would avoid dusts or powders, especially in homes with young children, since the chemical can get everywhere in this form.
 Baits or traps might be a better option in these cases, as the pesticide is housed in a more discrete location.
 What�s an environmentalist to do for green cleaning products now?
 Sutton still says you can go ahead and make your own � just use the recipes that skip the borax.
 What should you do with the box of borax already in your home?
 �Since borax is a pesticide, I�d advise disposing of it at a household hazardous waste facility, same as any other home use pesticide,� says Sutton.
 That�s where my box of borax is headed now.
 Many people mistakenly believe that the only way to launch an effective defense against the pest population is through the use of pesticides.
 This certainly is not true.
 All it requires is a bit of research on your part to discover several viable options for getting rid of the most common pests.
 For instance, borax is a crystalline salt that is used in the manufacturing of soaps and detergents.
 Borax is also frequently used as a mild antiseptic and water softener.
 While it may not seem like an obvious solution for getting rid of cockroaches, borax has been proven to be extremely effective in getting rid of these nasty pests.
 All you need to do is fill in around your cabinets, shelves, pipes, baseboards, sinks, and bathtubs with borax to eliminate your cockroach problem.
 Natural pesticides are often as close as your cabinets.
 You can have some remarkable success ridding your yard of ants with products from your kitchen or bathroom cabinets.
 These are just a few of the things that you can use, probably without leaving home to get them:
 Chalk Chalk
 Charcoal Charcoal
 Cayenne Pepper Pepper
 Damp Coffee Grounds Grounds
 Talcum Powder Powder
 Another household item that has worked to get rid of these pests is lemon juice.
 Squeezing a bit of lemon juice in any area where ants have been seen is sure to get rid of them.
 Did You Know?
 The Environmental Protection Agency approved the use of a plant-based protectant (MON 863) designed to control corn rootworm in crops?� crops?�
 There are actually a wide variety of alternatives to pesticides that have been documented through universities and independent research labs.
 While it may require a bit of time to locate this useful information, it is certainly worth any effort that you expend to find alternative, healthful options to getting rid of pests in your home without damaging the health of your family.
 Government Response to Pesticide Concerns:
 Business as Usual Usual
 Any time pesticides are registered for use on foods or feed crops, a specific tolerance level has to be established by the Environmental Protection Agency.
 In turn, these tolerance levels are then enforced by the Food and Drug Administration, as well as the Department of Agriculture.� Agriculture.�
 So, why don't these governmental agencies step up and become more active in eliminating synthetic pesticides from our lives?
 It is certainly an interesting question, but unfortunately, it is one that does not have clear answers.
 While growing numbers of independent groups and individuals are lobbying for safe, organic alternatives to traditional pesticides, the reality is that even though the pesticides are regulated, they continue to be used.
 How To Make Natural & Organic Pesticides Pesticides

 I'm just going to start with the bad news, OK?
 Borax is not a green cleaning ingredient, as many have been led to believe.
 Yes, the 20-mule team laundry booster box has a very "green" look to it and plenty of recipes for "green" homemade cleaners require it.
 But we won't be fooled, and we hope you won't be, either.
 In short:
 EWG does not recommend using borax to clean your home.
 What is borax?
 Borax is a (powdery, white) mineral that also goes by a few other names (just to make it confusing!):
 sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, or disodium tetraborate.
 A close cousin of borax is boric acid, which has many of the same concerns discussed below.
 While you might prefer to remember only one of these names, knowing them all helps you sleuth it out better when reading labels.
 Borax is a pesticide that poisons insects, fungus and weeds, but it also has plenty of other uses that we encounter in consumer products.
 How are we exposed to borax?
 In our daily lives, there are two ways most of us encounter borax:
 when we clean and when we preen.
 It's also in slimy toys and some nutritional supplements.
 1.
 Cleaning products products
 It's not easy to find out what's in most cleaning products, with a few exceptions.
 But it's important to try, since many products are a source of harmful air contaminants and, to make it that much harder, greenwashing is rampant.
 If you're thinking about making your own cleaning products as a safer alternative, we recommend that you not use the recipes that include borax, since it may pose health risks, too.
 Unfortunately, it's often pitched as a "green" or "natural" ingredient - but we don't agree.
 If you're going to make your own, consider these borax-free ideas.
 2.
 Personal care products products
 Boric acid or sodium borate can also be found in personal care products.
 The cosmetic industry's own safety panel states that these chemicals are unsafe for infant or damaged skin, because they can absorb readily into the body.
 Despite this guidance, boric acid is found in some diaper creams.
 See EWG's Skin Deep cosmetics database for other personal care products containing borax or boric acid and click here for diaper creams that don't contain it.
 Both the European Union and Canada restrict these ingredients in body care products made for children under three years of age and require that products containing these ingredients be labeled as not appropriate for broken or damaged skin.
 No similar safety standards are in place in the United States.
 3.
 Goopy toys toys
 Play Doh, silly putty, and other slimy toys may also contain boric acid.
 Homemade playdough is a safer alternative to the store bought variety - here's a simple, borax-free recipe.
 4.
 Nutritional supplements supplements
 Boron, a component of borax and boric acid, is considered a trace nutrient, though its essential biological role is unknown.
 As a result, some nutritional supplements contain boron, which may be in the form of boric acid - check the list of ingredients.
 What's the problem with borax?
 Borax can have short- and long-term health effects:
 Short-term irritant.
 Borax can be irritating when exposure occurs through skin or eye contact, inhalation or ingestion.
 Poison reports suggest misuse of borax-based pesticides can result in acute toxicity, with symptoms including vomiting, eye irritation, nausea, skin rash, oral irritation and respiratory effects.
 Toddlers and young children face special risks from hand-to-mouth transfer of carpet or crack and crevice, dust or spray borax treatments.
 Hormone disruption.
 Borax and its cousin, boric acid, may disrupt hormones and harm the male reproductive system.
 Men working in boric acid-producing factories have a greater risk of decreased sperm count and libido.
 According to EPA's safety review of these pesticides, chronic exposure to high doses of borax or boric acid causes testicular atrophy in male mice, rats and dogs.
 Animal studies reviewed by the EPA indicate that while the female reproductive system is less sensitive to borax, exposure to it can also lead to reduced ovulation and fertility.
 Borax and boric acid can cross the placenta, affecting fetal skeletal development and birth weight in animal studies of high-dose exposures.
 In its 2006 review of the safety of borax pesticides, the EPA declined to perform a risk assessment that included exposures from cleaning supplies, cosmetics and other consumer goods along with professional and consumer pest-control products.
 As a result, it's difficult to assess the level of risk that may be involved in using borax to clean your home.
 In light of the reproductive effects reported in both animal and worker studies, we suggest that you avoid borax in homemade or store-bought cleaning supplies.
 What should I use to keep my house clean?
 Most people buy cleaning products at the store, but making your own is pretty easy if you're up for it.
 Here are some simple tips for both - keeping in mind that a few basic products -- like all-purpose scrub -- are all that you really need:
 Buying cleaning products.
 At the store, look for certified green products with the Green Seal or EcoLogo mark on the label whenever possible.
 And check with the manufacturer for a complete list of ingredients in any cleaners you use.
 If they won't tell you what's in it - don't buy it.
 Unfortunately, borax will often only be listed on the product's label when its marketing reflects its pesticide qualities (e.g., the label claims it's an anti-bacterial product).
 If it's not marketed that way, manufacturers tend to claim that it's inert (which they can), because then it need not be listed on the label.
 Clear as mud, right?
 That's how they like it.
 Making your own.
 Common kitchen ingredients like vinegar, lemons, and baking soda make great homemade cleaning supplies.
 Always take care when combining ingredients - some combinations are safer than others! For example, combining bleach with any acid (vinegar, lemon juice) will create very toxic vapors that you don't want to breathe.
 Click here for some specifics about what not to combine.
 Whether you buy or make your own, remember:
 other than plain soap and water, most cleaning supplies should be handled with caution, since many may be skin or eye irritants or produce caustic vapors.
 Check out EWG's Healthy Home Tips on green cleaning for safer ways to keep your home clean.
 A recent blog post by the Environmental Working Group challenges the long-standing and widespread green cleaning image of borax.
 Bottom-line, EWG no longer recommends cleaning your home with borax.
 Like me, EWG recommended using borax in recipes for homemade cleaners in the past because it's effective, versatile, affordable, and eco-friendly compared to petroleum-based ingredients and chemicals in conventional cleaning products.
 Alternatives are less toxic, but they are rarely totally benign.
 Anything that cleans, kills.
 Ever treated dandelions with a dose of vinegar?
 Sterilized canning jars with boiling water?
 Under many municipal bans on pesticide use, borax is often allowed as a low-risk pesticide.
 The Georgia Strait Alliance's Toxic Smart Solutions factsheet says "while borax is also one of the least hazardous domestic cleaning products, it is not without an environmental impact.
 It contains a higher level of arsenic that most other products (30 parts per million) which is why it's also an effective ant killer." killer."
 Doing the best I can to clean up my act, I'm testing a new borax-free recipe of my all time favorite liquid laundry soap (I'll let you know if it works).
 For everything else, I can think of borax-free alternatives.
 (I was revising my old green cleaning recipes anyway.) anyway.)
 Here are some green cleaning ingredients, listed from least- to less-toxic:
 Least-toxic green cleaning ingredients ingredients

 Baking soda:
 is well-known for its deodorizing properties � you probably have a box in your fridge.
 But baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, not only deodorizes, it also tackles dirt and grease.
 Use it on its own or boost its cleaning power with a little liquid castile soap and vinegar to tackle everything from everyday spills to grimy build-up.
 Baking soda is also non-abrasive, which is great to scrub sinks, tubs, and toilets.
 White vinegar:
 also known as acetic acid, is a great disinfectant and deodorizer.
 The strong smell disappears once it dries.
 It's also my favourite addition to the dishwasher rinse dispenser.

 Lemon:
 a mild acid, lemon juice is known for its bleaching properties.
 It also has natural disinfectant and antibacterial properties.
 Cut a lemon in half and rub it onto a wooden cutting board, then wipe clean.
 Take the other half, place it in a bowl and microwave for one minute.
 Use this lemon-half to rub down the inside of your microwave.
 Let sit for a few minutes and wipe clean! clean!
 Olive oil:

 Washing soda:
 also known as sodium carbonate, washing soda is more caustic, with a higher pH than its cousin, baking soda.
 But it's just as versatile:
 softening water, removing stains and cutting grease-the only downside is it can be hard to find.
 Check your local health food store or organic grocer.
 Borax:
 also known as sodium borate is an alkaline mineral salt.
 It's a naturally occurring compound, but even things from nature can be harmful (like asbestos or mercury).
 Handled with respect, borax can be added to your cleaning arsenal.
 Mix solutions in your kitchen, away from food, and clearly label your finished product.
 Not unlike conventional cleaning products, homemade or store bought green cleaning solutions should be stored safely away from children and pets.

 Print this article Borax is a mineral compound, also called sodium tetraborate or trisodium tetraborate, derived from the element boron.
 Borax has many uses, including cleaning, a laundry brightener, insecticide and pesticide.
 Although borax is not violently toxic, it is effective in eliminating many pests, including a home's worst enemy, the termite.

 Why Borax?
 Borax is a very effective pesticide, fungicide and insecticide.
 It does not evaporate or volatize into the air, making it effective over a long period of time.
 Although it can pose a health hazard, especially if ingested, it is considered to have low toxicity and is therefore much safer to use than other insecticides such as chlorpyrifos, diazinon or pyrethrins.
 All of these traits make it a useful treatment for termites.
 Mode of Action Action
 As an insecticide, borax can be used in a bait formulation or as a dry powder.
 The powder is usually used to treat cracks and crevices where it becomes a fine layer of dust.
 As the termites walk through it, the powder sticks to their legs and they ingest it when grooming themselves.
 Once ingested, it acts as a poison in the stomach causing death within three to 10 days.
 The powder is also abrasive to their exoskeleton, causing dehydration, which aids in the death.
 The dry powder can continue to treat the area ensuring that hatching insects will also die.
 Long Term Solution Solution
 Termites cause millions of dollars in property damage each year.
 To combat this, companies are searching for solutions to protect property from termites before they infest.
 The SmartGUARD/Advance Guard products are a line of building materials including plywood, studs, joists, rafters and OSB panels that provide protection against fungus and termites.
 This solution was created and produced through a strategic alliance between three companies, U.S Borax Inc., Osmose and LP.
 These building supplies are pressure-treated with borates to prevent termites from infesting the property.
 There are also companies who specialize in treating homes and buildings under construction with a spray of protection containing borates.
 The spray will penetrate the wood, thereby providing years and years of protection from termites.
 Toxicity Toxicity
 Although an effective treatment for termites, borax is considered an environmentally friendly insecticide.
 It is safe for plants, as borates are an essential nutrient for plants.
 Boron is also an essential element for humans, although the compound borax should not be ingested and it may cause skin and eye irritation.
 If using the powder, just be sure to keep out of reach of children and treat in cracks and crevices where the family pet will not get to it.
 The building materials treated with borates are also safe and do not require any special treatment or disposal.
 Advantages Advantages
 Borax is safe and effective in treating termites.
 It can be used to treat an infestation or to prevent an infestation.
 It is cost effective, and even the SmartGUARD/Advance Guard products in 2009 cost only about $1.50 more than the comparable untreated material.
 Best of all, the termites will be gone without undue harm to the surrounding environment.

 Environmental Working Group Concludes Borax Should Not Be Used As A Cleaner Cleaner
 The growing awareness that toxic and caustic chemicals present in the vast majority of commercial and retail cleaning solutions need to be eliminated for the sake of both our outdoor and indoor environments has caused some to embrace alternative cleaning products which are touted as "natural." Borax is one of the leading substances which have been claimed by enthusiasts as being safe and organic, thus suitable for a chemical free cleaning program.
 It turns out that statement is far from the truth.
 Borax is a white, powdery mineral that is also known under various nomenclatures including sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, and disodium tetraborate.
 A similar substance to borax is boric acid, which has many of the same characteristics.
 Borax is a pesticide that poisons insects, fungus and weeds, but it also has a number of applications in consumer cleaning products.
 Rebecca Sutton, senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group states that borax has both short term and long term health effects.
 Borax acts as a short term irritant "when exposure occurs through skin or eye contact, inhalation or ingestion.
 Poison reports suggest misuse of borax-based pesticides can result in acute toxicity, with symptoms including vomiting, eye irritation, nausea, skin rash, oral irritation and respiratory effects.
 Toddlers and young children face special risks from hand-to-mouth transfer of carpet or crack and crevice, dust or spray borax treatments." treatments."
 Dr.
 Sutton continues with the long term detrimental effects of the substance:
 "Borax and its cousin, boric acid, may disrupt hormones and harm the male reproductive system.
 Men working in boric acid-producing factories have a greater risk of decreased sperm count and libido.
 According to EPA's safety review of these pesticides, chronic exposure to high doses of borax or boric acid causes testicular atrophy in male mice, rats and dogs.
 Animal studies reviewed by the EPA indicate that while the female reproductive system is less sensitive to borax, exposure to it can also lead to reduced ovulation and fertility.
 Borax and boric acid can cross the placenta, affecting fetal skeletal development and birth weight in animal studies of high-dose exposures.
 In light of the reproductive effects reported in both animal and worker studies, we suggest that you avoid borax in homemade or store-bought cleaning supplies." supplies."
 When it comes to the application of borax as an insecticide, Dr.
 Sutton stated "I have not yet done a rigorous comparison of home use insecticides, so it's hard for me to say if borax is the least toxic option.
 Obviously, any non-pesticidal ways to control roaches etc.
 are important (e.g.
 removing food sources, patching holes/cracks from which the bugs enter, using sticky traps), but sometimes they're not enough.
 I certainly would avoid dusts or powders, especially in homes with young children, since the chemical can get everywhere in this form.
 Baits or traps might be a better option in these cases, as the pesticide is housed in a more discrete location." location."
 Dr.
 Sutton concludes that the Environmental Working Group does not recommend using borax to clean your home.
 We at the Chemical Free Cleaning Network fully concur.
 There is no reason to use borax or any other chemical substance to clean any indoor environment, especially when we consider the wide spectrum of Chemical Free Technologies which sanitize without any chemical substances whatsoever! whatsoever!
 In the house:
 Keep counters, floors and pet feeding areas clean.
 Remove and clean up whatever the ants are after.
 Follow the ant trail and find out how they're getting in.
 Wipe up ants & ant trails w/soapy water.
 Caulk openings where they enter the house.
 Petroleum jelly in the cracks or duct tape can be a quick, temporary fix.
 Apply diatomaceous earth or silica gel into cracks.
 Apply a fine dusting to entry points that can't be caulked.
 Or, apply boric acid dust into cracks where ants emerge.
 It is a poison, so be sure it is inaccessible to pets and children.
 Apply a pyrethrin-based insecticide to entry points.
 Very effective as a repellent.
 Indoor Plants Note:
 Insects seem to always find stressed and weakened plants.
 Plants become stressed:
 - if there is water in the saucer all the time.
 - if plants are over-fertilized over-fertilized
 - (insects love fast, fragile new growth).
 In the yard:
 Ants are generally beneficial in the garden (e.g.
 they attack termites and eat flea eggs), so limit your control efforts to problem areas.
 Ants will protect aphids from their natural enemies and carry aphids to other plants.
 To prevent ants from climbing, apply a sticky, adhesive material (like Tanglefoot) to a band of nursery tape, tin foil, or plastic wrap wrapped around the base of the plant (band should be 12" wide for trees; as wide as possible for bushes), several inches above the ground.
 Place ant baits in problem areas.
 Look for boric acid ant baits or hydramethylnon baits.
 Less-toxic than arsenic.
 If an ant nest is a problem because it is near your house, you can destroy it with boiling water, insecticidal soap, a pyrethrin solution or diatomaceous earth.
 Caterpillars Hand pick, if possible.
 (It has been reported that tomato hornworms glow at night under a "black light.") light.")
 Apply products containing Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) an effective and popular product.
 Must be applied to the leaves when the caterpillars are eating.
 Safe to mammals and other insects, but will kill butterfly caterpillars, too, so be sure to target only the pest caterpillar-infested plants.
 Garden Insects Introduce frogs, toads and lizards into your yard.
 For small infestations, handpick or spray with full-force spray of water.
 To protect local beneficial insects like green lacewings and lady bugs, avoid using conventional pesticides.
 To attract and keep beneficial insects, grow a variety of flowering plants for year-round blooming.
 They need nectar, too.
 And you can buy beneficial insects.
 Less-toxic products to consider first:
 - dehydrating dusts (e.g.
 diatomaceous earth and silica gel) gel)
 - horticultural oil sprays (dormant oil in winter; and summer or supreme oils for the rest of the year) year)
 - insecticidal soaps soaps
 - biological pesticides (e.g.
 Bacillus thuringiensis) thuringiensis)
 For severe infestations, use less-toxic insecticides (e.g.
 pyrethrin) pyrethrin)
 Generally gauge the toxicity of a pesticide by the signal words on the label.
 Flies Successful fly control requires eliminating fly breeding areas rather than trying to control adult flies after they emerge.
 Keep kitchen garbage containers tightly closed.
 Clean regularly.
 Sprinkle dry soap or kitty litter into bottom of container.
 Rinse out your recyclables.
 Check your yard for:
 - garbage cans with loose lids, lids,
 - fruit rotting under trees, trees,
 - pet waste not collected daily, daily,
 - compost piles that are not turned at least once a week and where decomposing food is not covered with dirt or black plastic.
 Screen windows and doors.
 Use fly swatters, flypaper (streamers), traps with pheromones (sex attractant) or meat-baited traps.
 Mosquitoes Screen windows and doors.
 Remove all standing water near your house (tires, wading pools, bird baths, vases, barrels).
 Critical step! step!
 Use Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (a non-toxic, biological control) in ponds.
 Kills the larvae in the water.
 Encourage mosquito predators:
 birds, frogs, turtles, ants, spiders, dragonflies, bats, praying mantids.
 Repellents:
 Use citronella oil insect repellents.
 Burn citronella candles or oil at outside gatherings.
 While not proven, some people find that mosquitoes find them less attractive if they take B vitamins.
 Don't wear any strong smelling products like lotions, deodorants, hair spray, sun tan oils.
 They attract mosquitoes.
 The more-toxic mosquito repellent should be applied to clothing, not to skin.
 (Test fabric first to see if it will stain.) Yellow porch lights don't attract flying insects.
 Moths Clothes:
 Destroy all stages of clothes moths by cleaning garments before storing.
 Hang clothes in the sunlight and beat them to dislodge moth larvae and eggs, before storing.
 Store clothes in sealed bags.
 Vacuum closets thoroughly.
 Cedar repels moths.
 Roaches Close openings into house (e.g.
 gaps around pipes and electrical work, door molding, cracks in walls, etc.) with caulking, screening, weather-stripping.
 Seal all food containers.
 Clean dishes nightly, or, if you don't, be sure they're sitting in a basin of soapy water.
 Do not leave pet food out overnight.
 Apply boric acid dust into cracks and places where roaches hide, like under the refrigerator.
 Apply only in out-of-the-way places where pets and children can't touch it.
 Roaches will avoid piles of boric acid, so use a fine dusting.
 This is a proven, less-toxic roach control product.
 Apply fine dusting of diatomaceous earth or silica gel to roach walkways.
 These dusts dehydrate and repel roaches.
 Place bay leaves in the pantry, cupboards and on shelves to repel cockroaches.
 Use non-toxic roach traps (like Roach Motels&Cedilla;) to monitor the change in the population.
 Silverfish Silverfish feed on paper, glue, starch and some fabrics.
 They like warm and damp areas.
 Their presence can be an early indication of wood rot.
 Dry out damp areas.
 Vacuum to eliminate any food source in carpets and cracks.
 Follow advice under Roaches above.
 Snails and Slugs Minimize breeding spots-shady, cool, moist spots in the garden like an ivy patch, agapanthus, lilies, ice plant, wood pile, empty flower pots, etc.
 Hand pick-safest and surest method.
 Snails are active at night.
 With a flashlight, check traps (see below) 2 hrs.
 after sunset or in early morning.
 Kill snails by smashing or drowning in soapy water.
 (Dead snails will attract flies if not covered with dirt or collected in a bag).
 Use copper barriers (see below) to protect plants.
 If infestation is severe, judicious use of a metaldehyde snail bait may be needed.
 Be sure that pets can't get at it, e.g.
 place bait inside flattened tin cans (that snails can enter but your pet can't "nose" into) in the garden section with the most snail damage.
 The bait can attract and poison dogs.
 It is also toxic to birds, so place bait carefully.
 Traps:
 Propped up, overturned clay pots, boards, or black plastic sheeting.
 Sink shallow pans, filled with stale beer, in the ground, with the rim even with ground level.
 Remove dead snails regularly.
 Yeast in the beer attracts snails.
 Barrier:
 Copper stripping (2"+) mounted around raised planting beds keeps snails and slugs out of the protected area.
 (Snails won't cross copper.) Be sure to capture all snails already in the area.
 Bend sharp edges under to protect children and pets.
 Termites If you suspect you have termites, have the type identified.
 Prevention:
 Subterranean termites need water, so keep water away from the perimeter of the house.
 Keep area under and around the house free of decaying wood.
 Wood (house frame or firewood pile) should not be in direct contact with soil.
 Build with borate-treated wood.
 Watch for and destroy any termite-built earthen tubes (pencil width) in basement and foundation area.
 These are a sure sign you have subterranean termites.
 Treatment:
 Hire a professional who uses some of the following less-toxic techniques:
 Sand barrier around the house.
 Heat or cold treatment for drywood termites.
 Silica gel (dust) applied in attic.
 Use of less-toxic pesticides like pyrethroids, borax, and methoprene.
 Wasps Use non-toxic wasp traps.
 Trap wasps by suspending a piece of raw meat 1/2 inch over soapy water in a 5-gallon bucket.
 Fungus & Weed Control Control
 For This Try This This
 Fungus Control Choose plant varieties that are tolerant of or resistant to the fungi in our area.
 Plant roses in full sun, at least 3 ft.
 apart for good air circulation.
 Avoid over watering.
 Remove and carefully dispose of dead or diseased leaves and flowers.
 Do not add them to the compost pile.
 To control powdery mildew on roses:
 spray both sides of rose leaves with:
 2 tablespoons mild liquid soap, 2/3 teaspoons baking soda in 1 gal water.
 Spray in the morning, weekly.
 Spray leaves at the first sign of powdery mildew with an antitranspirant (e.g.
 Wilt-Pruf or Cloud Cover) as a preventative (not registered as fungicide, but has been reported to be effective).
 Or use sulfur-based fungicides, the least toxic of the conventional fungicides).
 Weed Control Pull weeds out with roots, or cut off weeds just below the surface with a hoe, minimizing soil disturbance (Note:
 Soil disturbance stimulates dormant weed seeds.) Kill weeds before they begin to flower and produce seeds! To kill the roots and seeds of weeds and the insects in a selected area, cover area for 4-6 weeks.
 in the summer with clear plastic sheeting (1 mil thickness is fine), seal w/soil at edges.
 Wet soil thoroughly before laying plastic.
 Remove plastic before planting.
 (Clear plastic heats sub-surface soil better than black.) black.)
 Cover areas of garden you want weed free with woven black garden fabric before you plant.
 You can spread bark over it and it won't disintegrate like black plastic.
 Garden fabric lets water drain through while preventing weeds from growing.
 Cover bare areas of garden with 5" of mulch.
 Or, cover bare areas with living ground cover like grass, vetch, annual rye grass, or crimson clover to crowd out weeds.
 Improves the soil also.
 In lawns, sprinkle grass seed in bare areas after weeding to prevent weeds from returning.
 Mow your grass to 2", no shorter.
 Discourages weed growth.
 Mow weekly.
 Encourages dense growth of grass shoots.
 Crowds weeds.
 Use commercially available soap solution/weed killers.
 Weeds can develop resistance to chemical herbicides (weed killers).
 If you use herbicides, limit use and paint or squirt product directly on individual weeds.
 Give herbicides enough time to work.
 Don't over apply.
 Control runoff of herbicides.
 Do not apply weed killers if rain is forecast.
 Runoff goes directly into our creeks.
 Herbicides may be toxic to the wildlife in and around our creeks.
 Moss:
 Soap-based moss killers are available.
 Some gardeners have been known to use bleach to kill moss in gardens.
 We do not recommend this practice.
 Yard runoff into the storm drain or creeks could be hazardous as bleach is very toxic to fish and other marine creatures.

 Pantry Moths Place herbs that have insect-repellent qualities on pantry shelves or even in stored grain.
 U.S Dept.
 of Agriculture has found this to be effective.
 Try bay leaves, coriander, dill, cinnamon, lemon peel, black pepper.
 Vacuum and wash down pantry shelves to kill eggs.
 Dust shelves and cracks with a dehydrating dust.
 If moths persist, try non-toxic, sticky, meal moth traps with pheromones.
 Store grains and flours in pest-tight containers (e.g.
 a glass jar with a rubber seal and a metal spring clamp; zip-lock type bags are not adequate).
 Freezing newly purchased bulk grains for a week will guarantee no new moths.
 Aphids Aphids almost always arrive before their predators.
 Don't panic.
 While you're waiting...
 Crush dense colonies at plant tips.
 Spray off with a strong stream of water.
 Spray with insecticidal soap.
 Mix 1 tablespoon dish soap/detergent & 1 cup vegetable oil.
 Add 1 teaspoon of this mix to 1 cup water and spray on aphids (works on mites, too).
 Try solution on a few leaves first.
 Oil may harm vegetable plants in the cabbage family.
 Introduce green lacewings to your garden.
 They stick around longer than imported lady bugs.
 Green lacewings love perennial bunch grasses growing in the shade.
 They appreciate a source of nectar and pollen in the winter (e.g.
 fennel and calendulas).
 Control aphids by controlling ants if ants are seen in aphid-infested areas.
 See ants.
 Don't fertilize plants with high nitrogen fertilizer in early spring.
 Aphids love the fast, new growth.
 Use a slow-release fertilizer like fish emulsion.
 Flea Control It is important to note that fleas can never be completely eradicated from your pets, or your home as long as you have pets.
 The key is to control infestations through a combination of these alternatives:
 In the house:
 Vacuum house frequently (every day, at the beginning of your flea program-especially carpet edges at the wall and pet bedding).
 Remove, seal, and dispose of the vacuum bag outside the home and away from pets.
 Leave vacuum bag in the sun for a day to kill fleas (will keep fleas from escaping into your yard from the trash).
 Clean pet bedding regularly.
 Steam clean the carpet; kills adults, the larvae and some eggs.
 The heat will trigger some of the eggs to hatch, so be prepared to vacuum soon after steam cleaning.
 Apply a dusting of diatomaceous earth or silica gel to pet bedding, under furniture and around house's foundation.
 Dehydrates adult fleas.
 Use Precor (methoprene), an "Insect Growth Regulator." "IGRs" interrupt the reproductive cycle of fleas.
 It prevents the flea larvae from maturing.
 Low-toxicity to mammals.
 Precor has recently become available by itself, without the more toxic adult flea killers.
 Pyrethrin/methoprene is a least-toxic combination of IGR and adult killer.
 Pyrethrin-based flea products are reported to be the least-toxic of the most commonly used conventional flea control products.
 Common forms found, in order of increasing toxicity:
 pyrethrums, pyrethrin alone or with inerts, pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide and inerts.
 On your pet:
 Use a flea comb specially designed to remove fleas from pets, drop fleas into soapy water.
 Wash pet with an insecticidal flea soap, a pyrethrin/methoprene flea shampoo, or a citrus oil shampoo or dip containing limonene or linalool.
 Begin regular baths when pets are young so they can get used to the idea.
 Pyrethrum powders can be used directly on pets.
 Avoid getting powder into pet's eyes, nostrils, mouth.
 Wear a dust mask.
 When cats clean themselves, they will ingest some, so don't over apply, and powder only when necessary.
 While not proven, many pet owners find it helpful to feed pets vitamin B pet supplements.
 Or sprinkle pet's food with brewer's yeast (nutritional yeast).
 Or mix raw garlic into pet's food.
 Seems to make the pet less attractive to fleas, and these additives are certainly good for the pet's general health.
 Discuss with your veterinarian.
 Best to introduce the pet to these additives when young.
 Experiment with natural flea repellents such as:
 eucalyptus, citronella, cedarwood, pennyroyal, and black walnut leaves.
 Find them in "essential oil" flea dips or herbal flea collars.
 Herbal repellents are most useful once the flea population is under control.
 Avoid using conventional flea collars (a constant, low-level exposure of your pet to a toxic substance).
 If you use them, limit use to periods of serious infestation.
 In the yard:
 Spray insecticidal soap outdoors in areas where fleas are concentrated.
 A walk with white socks will reveal the target areas.
 IGRs are not effective outdoors; they breakdown in ultraviolet light.
 Deodorizers Sprinkle litter box with baking soda before adding kitty litter.
 If pet wets the carpet, absorb as much moisture as you can, right away, with paper towels.
 Then either:
 - Sprinkle a mix of 1 part borax to 2 parts cornmeal on the spot.
 Vacuum up after 1 or 2 hours.
 - Or, apply a mix of 2 cups white vinegar in a gallon of water, and gently blot the stain.
 Both borax and vinegar could slightly bleach the carpet, so try on an inconspicuous area first.
 To discourage pets from wetting that spot again, sprinkle with dried pennyroyal.
 Animal Deterrents To keep cats from clawing furniture:
 (1) Purchase a scratching post or make one from carpet scraps.
 (2) Rub the herb rue on upholstery they claw.
 Rue is a bitter herb which cats detest.
 Avoid deterrent products containing paradichlorobenzene (there's evidence that it causes cancer in laboratory animals).
 To keep cats or dogs out of your yard:
 Blend 3 cloves garlic, 4 hot red peppers, and a few drops of detergent in water.
 Mix into a bucket of water and sprinkle solution around the edges of your yard.
 There are many tools and strategies for nontoxic pest control - using them together is known as Integrated Pest Management - a synthesis of combining tools from different areas to achieve a more total pest control.
 Maintenance Maintenance
 Primary to ant control is proper cleanliness, housekeeping, and maintenance.
 Next is to locate and destroy ant nest(s).
 Remove all clutter and debris inside and outside - it is often when doing this we locate the ant infestation.
 Trim all tree and bush branches that touch or overhang the building.
 Remove any landscaping that harbors or invites the ants into the building.
 Landscape mulch should be thin, less than 2� deep.
 Dig up ant nests / mounds repeatedly.
 Practice proper sanitation and improve drainage around building.
 Eliminate moisture problems and improve ventilation.
 Install and maintain dehumidifiers in damp areas.
 Caulk or seal all visible cracks, crevices or other openings around the perimeter of the building.
 Keep food and garbage properly stored away from ants.
 Make sure people eat only in designated areas.
 Routinely clean food areas:
 floors, counters, sinks, garbage bins, with a solution of Safe Solutions TweetMint Enzyme Cleaner (1 oz.
 per gallon water) with either a � cup of borax or baking soda per gallon of hot water.
 Use this cleaner to mop and wash surfaces.
 Crawling children should be kept off the borax cleaned floor.
 Spray kitchen surfaces with a solution of distilled white vinegar, or baking soda.
 Vacuum the infested areas thoroughly daily.
 If you are dry-vacuuming live ants, add a small amount of Safe Solutions Food-Grade DE, talcum or medicated body powder to the dry vacuum first.
 If you are wet-vacuuming live ants, add a small amount of Safe Solutions TweetMint Enzyme Cleaner or liquid detergent to the wet-vacuum first.
 Nontoxic Ant Sprays Sprays
 Spray ants with a solution of Safe Solutions TweetMint Enzyme Cleaner (1 oz.
 per quart water), or diluted dish soap (2 oz.
 - 4 oz.
 per quart water) in a spray bottle.
 Spray ants with Safe Solutions Not Nice to Bugs�.
 Mix 10% salt and some white pepper or Tobasco sauce in water and spray to repel ants.
 Blend 1 clove of garlic, 1 onion, 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper and 1 quart water.
 Steep mixture for 1 hour, strain, add 1 tablespoon of liquid soap and spray it for ant control.
 Ant Barriers & Repellents Repellents
 You can dust to deter ants with any of these nontoxic alternatives:
 Safe Solutions Food-Grade DE, talcum powder, medicated body powder, baking soda, Splenda�, dried peppermint, cinnamon, salt, freshly ground pepper (cayenne), garlic powder, cream of tartar, bone meal, powdered charcoal, cedar oil, Tide�soap, calcium chloride Bon Ami� or Comet�.
 Lightly blow or sprinkle the powder into the corners, cracks, crevices etc.
 where you have seen the ants infesting or entering building.
 A light layer works better than a heavy layer.
 Cucumber peels and damp coffee grounds are also known to repel ants.
 Create a barriers where you do not want them to cross.
 Draw a line with chalk, or anchor a strip of duct tape sticky-side up in places where ants are seen crossing.
 Ant Repellent - Dilute geraniol in olive oil.
 Fire Ant Repellent:
 Sprinkle talc, medicated body powder, or Food-Grade DE onto exposed skin/clothing.
 Outdoor Ant Repellent:
 Mix 10� oz.
 water, 3 oz.
 Tabasco sauce, and � oz.
 Safe Solutions TweetMint Enzyme Cleaner.
 Spray where ants are seen around the perimeter of the home or building.
 Find the ants' entrance and block it with a patch of petroleum jelly, toothpaste, white glue or tape.
 Spray them with Fantastic�, WD40�, Vaseline� or STP� oil treatment.
 Locate the place of ant entry, squeeze the juice of a lemon into it and leave the peel.
 Flood ant nests with a dilution of one of the following:
 Safe Solutions TweetMint Enzyme Cleaner (3 gallons warm water to 4 - 5 oz.
 TweetMint Enzyme Cleaner), Safe Solutions Food-Grade DE (4 tablespoons per gallon of water), or a dilution of orange juice, Lemon Joy�, Splenda�, peppermint or white vinegar.
 Ant mounds or nests can be gased with a carbon dioxide tank or a high pressure steamer.
 Ants nests in hollow tree trunks:
 First dust the nest with Safe Solutions Food-Grade DE, talcum powder and then fill the cavity with aerosol foam insulation, and turn the ants into "instant fossils".
 Put bands of cedar oil, Tanglefoot, Vaseline, fluoride toothpaste, or duct tape (sticky-side up) around the perimeter of the infested tree(s).
 Nontoxic Ant Baits Baits
 Note:
 Baiting works best when proper sanitation measures have eliminated the ant's alternative food sources.
 Most ants living in a house or other structure are typically feeding on people food and only rarely on honeydew.
 Ant food preferences are often seasonal, and their foraging needs can and do vary hourly.
 Ant baits should be used when the temperature is above 70� F and less than 90� F, and kept out of rain.
 Place baits where you see ants.
 The only way to eliminate ants permanently is to destroy the queen(s), thefore the ants must be able to carry the bait back to the queen.
 If the ants are dying near the bait, it may be too strong.
 However, if you still have ants after two weeks, the bait is too weak.
 Ant baits should be made by first finding their preferred food source, (e.g.
 apple sauce, creamy peanut butter, shortening, sugar water, moist cat food, honey, light Karo Syrup, jelly) and then lightly mixing in a small amount of borax or boric acid (about 1% - 2%); or (3% - 5%) Food-Grade DE, or aspartame (Equal� or Nutrasweet�).
 Use a variety of baits.
 Try adding a little diluted Tagmet, aspartame or baking soda to your ant baits.
 Make a bait mixture of 50% baking soda and 50% powdered sugar.
 Make a bait mixture of 50% instant grits and 50% packets of Equal�.
 Make a bait mixture of 1/3 powdered sugar, 1/3 baking soda and 1/3 powdered Vitamin C.
 Spray dry dog food with diluted 1% borax or sodium borate; let dry and grind to powder and then use as ant bait.
 This bait will also kill rats and mice.
 If you are a smoker, wear clean gloves before handling bait.
 Keep borax / borate baits away from children, pets and wildlife.
 Bait until the ants quit taking the bait.

 There's always been a lot of hoopla around using borax, but increasing studies are showing that it's not all that non-toxic! non-toxic!
 Please note I am in no way connected to this article except for the fact I think it is a great article! article!

 Borax:
 Not the green alternative it's cracked up to be be
 By Lisa Frack Frack
 February 17, 2011 2011
 By Rebecca Sutton, PhD, EWG Senior Scientist Scientist
 I'm just going to start with the bad news, OK?
 Borax is not a green cleaning ingredient, as many have been led to believe.
 Yes, the 20-mule team laundry booster box has a very "green" look to it and plenty of recipes for "green" homemade cleaners require it.
 But we won't be fooled, and we hope you won't be, either.
 In short:
 EWG does not recommend using borax to clean your home.
 What is borax?
 Borax is a (powdery, white) mineral that also goes by a few other names (just to make it confusing!):
 sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, or disodium tetraborate.
 A close cousin of borax is boric acid, which has many of the same concerns discussed below.
 While you might prefer to remember only one of these names, knowing them all helps you sleuth it out better when reading labels.
 Borax is a pesticide that poisons insects, fungus and weeds, but it also has plenty of other uses that we encounter in consumer products.
 How are we exposed to borax?
 In our daily lives, there are two ways most of us encounter borax:
 when we clean and when we preen.
 It's also in slimy toys and some nutritional supplements.
 1.
 Cleaning products products
 It's not easy to find out what's in most cleaning products, with a few exceptions.
 But it's important to try, since many products are a source of harmful air contaminants and, to make it that much harder, greenwashing is rampant.
 If you're thinking about making your own cleaning products as a safer alternative, we recommend that you not use the recipes that include borax, since it may pose health risks, too.
 Unfortunately, it's often pitched as a "green" or "natural" ingredient - but we don't agree.
 If you're going to make your own, consider these borax-free ideas.
 2.
 Personal care products products
 Boric acid or sodium borate can also be found in personal care products.
 The cosmetic industry's own safety panel states that these chemicals are unsafe for infant or damaged skin, because they can absorb readily into the body.
 Despite this guidance, boric acid is found in some diaper creams.
 See EWG's Skin Deep cosmetics database for other personal care products containing borax or boric acid and click here for diaper creams that don't contain it.
 Both the European Union and Canada restrict these ingredients in body care products made for children under three years of age and require that products containing these ingredients be labeled as not appropriate for broken or damaged skin.
 No similar safety standards are in place in the United States.
 3.
 Goopy toys toys
 Play Doh, silly putty, and other slimy toys may also contain boric acid.
 Homemade playdough is a safer alternative to the store bought variety - here's a simple, borax-free recipe.
 4.
 Nutritional supplements supplements
 Boron, a component of borax and boric acid, is considered a trace nutrient, though its essential biological role is unknown.
 As a result, some nutritional supplements contain boron, which may be in the form of boric acid - check the list of ingredients.
 What's the problem with borax?
 Borax can have short- and long-term health effects:
 Short-term irritant.
 Borax can be irritating when exposure occurs through skin or eye contact, inhalation or ingestion.
 Poison reports suggest misuse of borax-based pesticides can result in acute toxicity, with symptoms including vomiting, eye irritation, nausea, skin rash, oral irritation and respiratory effects.
 Toddlers and young children face special risks from hand-to-mouth transfer of carpet or crack and crevice, dust or spray borax treatments.
 Hormone disruption.
 Borax and its cousin, boric acid, may disrupt hormones and harm the male reproductive system.
 Men working in boric acid-producing factories have a greater risk of decreased sperm count and libido.
 According to EPA's safety review of these pesticides, chronic exposure to high doses of borax or boric acid causes testicular atrophy in male mice, rats and dogs.
 Animal studies reviewed by the EPA indicate that while the female reproductive system is less sensitive to borax, exposure to it can also lead to reduced ovulation and fertility.
 Borax and boric acid can cross the placenta, affecting fetal skeletal development and birth weight in animal studies of high-dose exposures.
 In its 2006 review of the safety of borax pesticides, the EPA declined to perform a risk assessment that included exposures from cleaning supplies, cosmetics and other consumer goods along with professional and consumer pest-control products.
 As a result, it's difficult to assess the level of risk that may be involved in using borax to clean your home.
 In light of the reproductive effects reported in both animal and worker studies, we suggest that you avoid borax in homemade or store-bought cleaning supplies.
 What should I use to keep my house clean?
 Most people buy cleaning products at the store, but making your own is pretty easy if you're up for it.
 Here are some simple tips for both - keeping in mind that a few basic products -- like all-purpose scrub -- are all that you really need:
 Buying cleaning products.
 At the store, look for certified green products with the Green Seal or EcoLogo mark on the label whenever possible.
 And check with the manufacturer for a complete list of ingredients in any cleaners you use.
 If they won't tell you what's in it - don't buy it.
 Unfortunately, borax will often only be listed on the product's label when its marketing reflects its pesticide qualities (e.g., the label claims it's an anti-bacterial product).
 If it's not marketed that way, manufacturers tend to claim that it's inert (which they can), because then it need not be listed on the label.
 Clear as mud, right?
 That's how they like it.
 Making your own.
 Common kitchen ingredients like vinegar, lemons, and baking soda make great homemade cleaning supplies.
 Always take care when combining ingredients - some combinations are safer than others! For example, combining bleach with any acid (vinegar, lemon juice) will create very toxic vapors that you don't want to breathe.
 Click here for some specifics about what not to combine.
 Whether you buy or make your own, remember:
 other than plain soap and water, most cleaning supplies should be handled with caution, since many may be skin or eye irritants or produce caustic vapors.

 antimetabolite, a substance that competes with, replaces, or inhibits a specific metabolite of a cell and thereby interferes with the cell�s normal metabolic functioning.
 An antimetabolite is similar in structure to a metabolite, or enzymatic substrate, which is normally recognized and acted upon by an enzyme to form a substance required by the cell.
 Although the antimetabolite may resemble the substrate enough to be taken up by the cell, it does not react in the same way with the enzyme�either the enzymatic reaction is inhibited or the antimetabolite is converted by the enzyme into an aberrant component.
 Many antimetabolites are used for therapeutic purposes.
 Sulfanilamides are antimetabolites that disrupt bacterial, but not human, metabolism and are used to eradicate bacterial infections in humans.
 Other antimetabolites such as methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil are used to treat a variety of cancers.

 Enzyme inhibitorFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia encyclopedia

 HIV protease in a complex with the protease inhibitor ritonavir.
 The structure of the protease is shown by the red, blue and yellow ribbons.
 The inhibitor is shown as the smaller ball-and-stick structure near the centre.
 Created from PDB 1HXW.An enzyme inhibitor is a molecule that binds to enzymes and decreases their activity.
 Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are enzyme inhibitors.
 They are also used as herbicides and pesticides.
 Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.
 The binding of an inhibitor can stop a substrate from entering the enzyme's active site and/or hinder the enzyme from catalysing its reaction.
 Inhibitor binding is either reversible or irreversible.
 Irreversible inhibitors usually react with the enzyme and change it chemically (e.g.
 via covalent bond formation).
 These inhibitors modify key amino acid residues needed for enzymatic activity.
 In contrast, reversible inhibitors bind non-covalently and different types of inhibition are produced depending on whether these inhibitors bind the enzyme, the enzyme-substrate complex, or both.
 Many drug molecules are enzyme inhibitors, so their discovery and improvement is an active area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology.
 A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, which indicates the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme).
 A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.
 Enzyme inhibitors also occur naturally and are involved in the regulation of metabolism.
 For example, enzymes in a metabolic pathway can be inhibited by downstream products.
 This type of negative feedback slows flux through a pathway when the products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain homeostasis in a cell.
 Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target.
 This can help control enzymes that may be damaging to a cell, such as proteases or nucleases; a well-characterised example is the ribonuclease inhibitor, which binds to ribonucleases in one of the tightest known protein�protein interactions. Natural enzyme inhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as ways of killing prey.

  Reversible inhibitors Types of reversible inhibitorsReversible inhibitors bind to enzymes with non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and ionic bonds.
 Multiple weak bonds between the inhibitor and the active site combine to produce strong and specific binding.
 In contrast to substrates and irreversible inhibitors, reversible inhibitors generally do not undergo chemical reactions when bound to the enzyme and can be easily removed by dilution or dialysis.
 Competitive inhibition:
 substrate (S) and inhibitor (I) compete for the active site.There are four kinds of reversible enzyme inhibitors.
 They are classified according to the effect of varying the concentration of the enzyme's substrate on the inhibitor.[2] inhibitor.[2]
 In competitive inhibition, the substrate and inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme at the same time, as shown in the figure on the left.
 This usually results from the inhibitor having an affinity for the active site of an enzyme where the substrate also binds; the substrate and inhibitor compete for access to the enzyme's active site.
 This type of inhibition can be overcome by sufficiently high concentrations of substrate (Vmax remains constant), i.e., by out-competing the inhibitor.
 However, the apparent Km will increase as it takes a higher concentration of the substrate to reach the Km point, or half the Vmax.
 Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate (see examples below).
 In uncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds only to the substrate-enzyme complex, it should not be confused with non-competitive inhibitors.
 This type of inhibition causes Vmax to decrease (maximum velocity decreases as a result of removing activated complex) and Km to decrease(due to better binding efficiency as a result of Le Chatelier's principle and the effective elimination of the ES complex thus decreasing the Km which indicates a higher binding affinity.
 In mixed inhibition, the inhibitor can bind to the enzyme at the same time as the enzyme's substrate.
 However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate, and vice versa.
 This type of inhibition can be reduced, but not overcome by increasing concentrations of substrate.
 Although it is possible for mixed-type inhibitors to bind in the active site, this type of inhibition generally results from an allosteric effect where the inhibitor binds to a different site on an enzyme.
 Inhibitor binding to this allosteric site changes the conformation (i.e., tertiary structure or three-dimensional shape) of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the active site is reduced.
 Non-competitive inhibition is a form of mixed inhibition where the binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme reduces its activity but does not affect the binding of substrate.
 As a result, the extent of inhibition depends only on the concentration of the inhibitor.
 Vmax will decrease due to the inability for the reaction to proceed as efficiently, but Km will remain the same as the actual binding of the substrate, by definition, will still function properly.
  Quantitative description of reversible inhibitionReversible inhibition can be described quantitatively in terms of the inhibitor's binding to the enzyme and to the enzyme�substrate complex, and its effects on the kinetic constants of the enzyme.
 In the classic Michaelis�Menten scheme below, an enzyme (E) binds to its substrate (S) to form the enzyme�substrate complex ES.
 Upon catalysis, this complex breaks down to release product P and free enzyme.
 The inhibitor (I) can bind to either E or ES with the dissociation constants Ki or Ki', respectively.
 Competitive inhibitors can bind to E, but not to ES.
 Competitive inhibition increases Km (i.e., the inhibitor interferes with substrate binding), but does not affect Vmax (the inhibitor does not hamper catalysis in ES because it cannot bind to ES).
 Non-competitive inhibitors have identical affinities for E and ES (Ki = Ki').
 Non-competitive inhibition does not change Km (i.e., it does not affect substrate binding) but decreases Vmax (i.e., inhibitor binding hampers catalysis).
 Mixed-type inhibitors bind to both E and ES, but their affinities for these two forms of the enzyme are different (Ki ?
 Ki').
 Thus, mixed-type inhibitors interfere with substrate binding (increase Km) and hamper catalysis in the ES complex (decrease Vmax).
 Kinetic scheme for reversible enzyme inhibitors inhibitors
 When an enzyme has multiple substrates, inhibitors can show different types of inhibition depending on which substrate is considered.
 This results from the active site containing two different binding sites within the active site, one for each substrate.
 For example, an inhibitor might compete with substrate A for the first binding site, but be a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to substrate B in the second binding site.[3] site.[3]
  Measuring the dissociation constants of a reversible inhibitor inhibitor
 Lineweaver�Burk plots of different types of reversible enzyme inhibitors.
 The arrow shows the effect of increasing concentrations of inhibitor.As noted above, an enzyme inhibitor is characterised by its two dissociation constants, Ki and Ki', to the enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex, respectively.
 The enzyme-inhibitor constant Ki can be measured directly by various methods; one extremely accurate method is isothermal titration calorimetry, in which the inhibitor is titrated into a solution of enzyme and the heat released or absorbed is measured.[4] However, the other dissociation constant Ki' is difficult to measure directly, since the enzyme-substrate complex is short-lived and undergoing a chemical reaction to form the product.
 Hence, Ki' is usually measured indirectly, by observing the enzyme activity under various substrate and inhibitor concentrations, and fitting the data[5] to a modified Michaelis�Menten equation equation
 where the modifying factors a and a' are defined by the inhibitor concentration and its two dissociation constants constants
 Thus, in the presence of the inhibitor, the enzyme's effective Km and Vmax become (a/a')Km and (1/a')Vmax, respectively.
 However, the modified Michaelis-Menten equation assumes that binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme has reached equilibrium, which may be a very slow process for inhibitors with sub-nanomolar dissociation constants.
 In these cases, it is usually more practical to treat the tight-binding inhibitor as an irreversible inhibitor (see below); however, it can still be possible to estimate Ki' kinetically if Ki is measured independently.
 The effects of different types of reversible enzyme inhibitors on enzymatic activity can be visualized using graphical representations of the Michaelis�Menten equation, such as Lineweaver�Burk and Eadie-Hofstee plots.
 For example, in the Lineweaver�Burk plots at the right, the competitive inhibition lines intersect on the y-axis, illustrating that such inhibitors do not affect Vmax.
 Similarly, the non-competitive inhibition lines intersect on the x-axis, showing these inhibitors do not affect Km.
 However, it can be difficult to estimate Ki and Ki' accurately from such plots,[6] so it is advisable to estimate these constants using more reliable nonlinear regression methods, as described above.
  Special casesThe mechanism of partially competitive inhibition is similar to that of non-competitive, except that the EIS complex has catalytic activity, which may be lower or even higher (partially competitive activation) than that of the enzyme�substrate (ES) complex.
 This inhibition typically displays a lower Vmax, but an unaffected Km value.[7] value.[7]
 Uncompetitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor binds only to the enzyme�substrate complex, not to the free enzyme; the EIS complex is catalytically inactive.
 This mode of inhibition is rare and causes a decrease in both Vmax and the Km value.[7] value.[7]
 Substrate and product inhibition is where either the substrate or product of an enzyme reaction inhibit the enzyme's activity.
 This inhibition may follow the competitive, uncompetitive or mixed patterns.
 In substrate inhibition there is a progressive decrease in activity at high substrate concentrations.
 This may indicate the existence of two substrate-binding sites in the enzyme.
 At low substrate, the high-affinity site is occupied and normal kinetics are followed.
 However, at higher concentrations, the second inhibitory site becomes occupied, inhibiting the enzyme.[8] Product inhibition is often a regulatory feature in metabolism and can be a form of negative feedback.
 Slow-tight inhibition occurs when the initial enzyme�inhibitor complex EI undergoes isomerisation to a second more tightly held complex, EI*, but the overall inhibition process is reversible.
 This manifests itself as slowly increasing enzyme inhibition.
 Under these conditions, traditional Michaelis�Menten kinetics give a false value for Ki, which is time�dependent.
 The true value of Ki can be obtained through more complex analysis of the on (kon) and off (koff) rate constants for inhibitor association.
 See irreversible inhibition below for more information.
  Examples of reversible inhibitors inhibitors
 Peptide-based HIV-1 protease inhibitor ritonavirAs enzymes have evolved to bind their substrates tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind in the active site of enzymes, it is unsurprising that some of these inhibitors are strikingly similar in structure to the substrates of their targets.
 An example of these substrate mimics are the protease inhibitors, a very successful class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV.[9] The structure of ritonavir, a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three peptide bonds, is shown on the right.
 As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.
 Enzyme inhibitors are often designed to mimic the transition state or intermediate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction.
 This ensures that the inhibitor exploits the transition state stabilising effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower Ki) than substrate-based designs.
 An example of such a transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug oseltamivir; this drug mimics the planar nature of the ring oxonium ion in the reaction of the viral enzyme neuraminidase.[10] neuraminidase.[10]
 Nonpeptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitor tipranavirHowever, not all inhibitors are based on the structures of substrates.
 For example, the structure of another HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir is shown on the left.
 This molecule is not based on a peptide and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate.
 These non-peptide inhibitors can be more stable than inhibitors containing peptide bonds, because they will not be substrates for peptidases and are less likely to be degraded.[11] degraded.[11]
 In drug design it is important to consider the concentrations of substrates to which the target enzymes are exposed.
 For example, some protein kinase inhibitors have chemical structures that are similar to adenosine triphosphate, one of the substrates of these enzymes.
 However, drugs that are simple competitive inhibitors will have to compete with the high concentrations of ATP in the cell.
 Protein kinases can also be inhibited by competition at the binding sites where the kinases interact with their substrate proteins, and most proteins are present inside cells at concentrations much lower than the concentration of ATP.
 As a consequence, if two protein kinase inhibitors both bind in the active site with similar affinity, but only one has to compete with ATP, then the competitive inhibitor at the protein-binding site will inhibit the enzyme more effectively.[12] effectively.[12]
  Irreversible inhibitors Types of irreversible inhibition inhibition
 Reaction of the irreversible inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) with a serine proteaseIrreversible inhibitors usually covalently modify an enzyme, and inhibition can therefore not be reversed.
 Irreversible inhibitors often contain reactive functional groups such as nitrogen mustards, aldehydes, haloalkanes, alkenes, Michael acceptors, phenyl sulfonates, or fluorophosphonates.
 These electrophilic groups react with amino acid side chains to form covalent adducts.
 The residues modified are those with side chains containing nucleophiles such as hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups; these include the amino acids serine (as in DFP, right), cysteine, threonine or tyrosine.[13] tyrosine.[13]
 Irreversible inhibition is different from irreversible enzyme inactivation.
 Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for one class of enzyme and do not inactivate all proteins; they do not function by destroying protein structure but by specifically altering the active site of their target.
 For example, extremes of pH or temperature usually cause denaturation of all protein structure, but this is a non-specific effect.
 Similarly, some non-specific chemical treatments destroy protein structure:
 for example, heating in concentrated hydrochloric acid will hydrolyse the peptide bonds holding proteins together, releasing free amino acids.[14] acids.[14]
 Irreversible inhibitors display time-dependent inhibition and their potency therefore cannot be characterised by an IC50 value.
 This is because the amount of active enzyme at a given concentration of irreversible inhibitor will be different depending on how long the inhibitor is pre-incubated with the enzyme.
 Instead, kobs/[I] values are used,[15] wherekobs is the observed pseudo-first order rate of inactivation (obtained by plotting the log of % activity vs.
 time) and [I] is the concentration of inhibitor.
 The kobs/[I] parameter is valid as long as the inhibitor does not saturate binding with the enzyme (in which case kobs = kinact).
  Analysis of irreversible inhibition inhibition
 Kinetic scheme for irreversible inhibitorsAs shown in the figure to the left, irreversible inhibitors form a reversible non-covalent complex with the enzyme (EI or ESI) and this then reacts to produce the covalently modified "dead-end complex" EI*.
 The rate at which EI* is formed is called the inactivation rate or kinact.
 Since formation of EI may compete with ES, binding of irreversible inhibitors can be prevented by competition either with substrate or with a second, reversible inhibitor.
 This protection effect is good evidence of a specific reaction of the irreversible inhibitor with the active site.
 The binding and inactivation steps of this reaction are investigated by incubating the enzyme with inhibitor and assaying the amount of activity remaining over time.
 The activity will be decrease in a time-dependent manner, usually following exponential decay.
 Fitting these data to a rate equation gives the rate of inactivation at this concentration of inhibitor.
 This is done at several different concentrations of inhibitor.
 If a reversible EI complex is involved the inactivation rate will be saturable and fitting this curve will give kinact and Ki.[16] Ki.[16]
 Another method that is widely used in these analyses is mass spectrometry.
 Here, accurate measurement of the mass of the unmodified native enzyme and the inactivated enzyme gives the increase in mass caused by reaction with the inhibitor and shows the stoichiometry of the reaction.[17] This is usually done using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.
 In a complementary technique, peptide mass fingerprinting involves digestion of the native and modified protein with a protease such as trypsin.
 This will produce a set of peptides that can be analysed using a mass spectrometer.
 The peptide that changes in mass after reaction with the inhibitor will be the one that contains the site of modification.
  Special cases cases
 Chemical mechanism for irreversible inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase by DFMO.
 Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (Py) and enzyme (E) are not shown.
 Adapted from[18]Not all irreversible inhibitors form covalent adducts with their enzyme targets.
 Some reversible inhibitors bind so tightly to their target enzyme that they are essentially irreversible.
 These tight-binding inhibitors may show kinetics similar to covalent irreversible inhibitors.
 In these cases, some of these inhibitors rapidly bind to the enzyme in a low-affinity EI complex and this then undergoes a slower rearrangement to a very tightly bound EI* complex (see figure above).
 This kinetic behaviour is called slow-binding.[19] This slow rearrangement after binding often involves a conformational change as the enzyme "clamps down" around the inhibitor molecule.
 Examples of slow-binding inhibitors include some important drugs, such methotrexate,[20] allopurinol,[21] and the activated form of acyclovir.[22] acyclovir.[22]
  Examples of irreversible inhibitors inhibitors
 Trypanothione reductase with the lower molecule of an inhibitor bound irreversibly and the upper one reversibly.
 Created from PDB 1GXF.Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) is shown as an example of an irreversible protease inhibitor in the figure above right.
 The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus�fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains bound to the serine in the active site, deactivating it.[23] Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of acetylcholine esterase in the synapses of neurons, and consequently is a potent neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100 mg.[24] mg.[24]
 Suicide inhibition is an unusual type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a reactive form in its active site.
 An example is the inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, a-difluoromethylornithine or DFMO, which is an analogue of the amino acid ornithine, and is used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness).
 Ornithine decarboxylase can catalyse the decarboxylation of DFMO instead of ornithine, as shown above.
 However, this decarboxylation reaction is followed by the elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a conjugated imine, a highly electrophilic species.
 This reactive form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.[18] enzyme.[18]
 Since irreversible inhibition often involves the initial formation of a non-covalent EI complex, it is sometimes possible for an inhibitor to bind to an enzyme in more than one way.
 For example, in the figure showing trypanothione reductase from the human protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, two molecules of an inhibitor called quinacrine mustard are bound in its active site.
 The top molecule is bound reversibly, but the lower one is bound covalently as it has reacted with an amino acid residue through its nitrogen mustard group.[25] group.[25]
  Discovery and design of inhibitors inhibitors
 Robots used for the high-throughput screening of chemical libraries to discover new enzyme inhibitorsNew drugs are the products of a long drug development process, the first step of which is often the discovery of a new enzyme inhibitor.
 In the past the only way to discover these new inhibitors was by trial and error:
 environmental chemicals includes some pesticides.
 screening huge libraries of compounds against a target enzyme and hoping that some useful leads would emerge.
 This brute force approach is still successful and has even been extended by combinatorial chemistry approaches that quickly produce large numbers of novel compounds and high-throughput screening technology to rapidly screen these huge chemical libraries for useful inhibitors.[26] inhibitors.[26]
 More recently, an alternative approach has been applied:
 rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors.[27] These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor.
 This new inhibitor is then used to try to obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex to show how the molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to optimise binding.
 This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced.[28] Computer-based methods of predicting the affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking[29] and molecular mechanics.
  Uses of inhibitorsEnzyme inhibitors are found in nature and are also designed and produced as part of pharmacology and biochemistry.
 Natural poisons are often enzyme inhibitors that have evolved to defend a plant or animal against predators.
 These natural toxins include some of the most poisonous compounds known.
 Artificial inhibitors are often used as drugs, but can also be insecticides such as malathion, herbicides such as glyphosate, or disinfectants such as triclosan.

 The most common uses for enzyme inhibitors are as drugs to treat disease.
 Many of these inhibitors target a human enzyme and aim to correct a pathological condition.
 However, not all drugs are enzyme inhibitors.
 Some, such as anti-epileptic drugs, alter enzyme activity by causing more or less of the enzyme to be produced.
 These effects are called enzyme induction and inhibition and are alterations in gene expression, which is unrelated to the type of enzyme inhibition discussed here.
 Other drugs interact with cellular targets that are not enzymes, such as ion channels or membrane receptors.
 An example of a medicinal enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction.
 This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate.[30] This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection.
 Since the drug decreases the activity of the enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last for a longer period of time.
 Another example of the structural similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target is seen in the figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid.
 Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate.
 Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides.
 This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly-growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.[31] chemotherapy.[31]
 Drugs also are used to inhibit enzymes needed for the survival of pathogens.
 For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan.
 Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together.[32] This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst.
 In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).
 Drug design is facilitated when an enzyme that is essential to the pathogen's survival is absent or very different in humans.
 In the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors of this process are selectively toxic to bacteria.
 Selective toxicity is also produced in antibiotics by exploiting differences in the structure of the ribosomes in bacteria, or how they make fatty acids.
  Metabolic controlEnzyme inhibitors are also important in metabolic control.
 Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition.
 A good example is the allosteric regulation of the glycolytic pathway.
 This catabolic pathway consumes glucose and produces ATP, NADH and pyruvate.
 A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1).
 When ATP levels rise, ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease the rate of the enzyme reaction; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls.
 This negative feedback control helps maintain a steady concentration of ATP in the cell.
 However, metabolic pathways are not just regulated through inhibition since enzyme activation is equally important.
 With respect to PFK1, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and ADP are examples of metabolites that are allosteric activators.[33] activators.[33]
 Physiological enzyme inhibition can also be produced by specific protein inhibitors.
biochemical pesticides include chemicals that can interfere with the growth, feeding, or reproduction of pests or insect pheromones applied for mating disruption, monitoring or attract-and-kill strategies (copping and menn, 2000).
 This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens.
 Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so it is important to inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself.
 One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the pancreas.
 This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ.[34] Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state.[35] Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase[36] and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.[37] phosphatases.[37]
  Pesticides and herbicidesMany herbicides and pesticides are enzyme inhibitors.
 Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme found in animals from insects to humans.
 It is essential to nerve cell function through its mechanism of breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into its constituents, acetate and choline.
 This is somewhat unique among neurotransmitters as most, including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, are absorbed from the synaptic cleft rather than cleaved.
 A large number of AChE inhibitors are used in both medicine and agriculture.
 Reversible competitive inhibitors, such as edrophonium, physostigmine, and neostigmine, are used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis and in anaesthesia.
 The carbamate pesticides are also examples of reversible AChE inhibitors.
 The organophosphate insecticides such as malathion, parathion, and chlorpyrifos irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase.
 The herbicide glyphosate is an inhibitor of 3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase,[38] other herbicides, such as the sulfonylureas inhibit the enzyme acetolactate synthase.
 Both these enzymes are needed for plants to make branched-chain amino acids.
 Many other enzymess are inhibited by herbicides, including enzymes needed for the biosynthesis of lipids and carotenoids and the processes of photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation.[39] phosphorylation.[39]
 To discourage seed predators, pulses contain trypsin inhibitors that interfere with digestion. Natural poisonsAnimals and plants have evolved to synthesise a vast array of poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors.
 Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes.[40] The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell.
 For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.[41] cytoskeleton.[41]
 Many natural poisons act as neurotoxins that can cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey.
 Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses.[42] An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
 Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death.
 Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.[43] receptors.[43]
 Although many natural toxins are secondary metabolites, these poisons also include peptides and proteins.
 An example of a toxic peptide is alpha-amanitin, which is found in relatives of the death cap mushroom.
 This is a potent enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA.[44] The algal toxin microcystin is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases.[45] This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is a known carcinogen that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.[46] doses.[46]
 Proteins can also be natural poisons or antinutrients, such as the trypsin inhibitors (discussed above) that are found in some legumes, as shown in the figure above.
 A less common class of toxins are toxic enzymes:
 these act as irreversible inhibitors of their target enzymes and work by chemically modifying their substrate enzymes.
 An example is ricin, an extremely potent protein toxin found in castor oil beans.
 This enzyme is a glycosidase that inactivates ribosomes.
 Since ricin is a catalytic irreversible inhibitor, this allows just a single molecule of ricin to kill a cell.[47] cell.[47]

 Activity-based proteomics - a branch of proteomics that uses covalent enzyme inhibitors as reporters to monitor enzyme activity.
 Imidazole, an anti metabolite of histamine and nicotinic acid, has been found to be a safe and effective pesticide.
 The biological effects of imidazole have been evaluated on a metabolic basis and as a contact insecticide.
 Reversal of imidazole with histamine, histamine derivatives, and nicotinic acid has been demonstrated within a biological system.
 Imidazole, when synergized with boric acid, may be employed at low levels to proof fabric satisfactorily against insect attack.
 When synergized with 2- Aminopyridine and combined with base oil, imidazole quickly controlled a number of insect and related arthropod species.
 The effectiveness of imidazole was significantly increased by adding two surfactants to base oil.
 A hydrophilic surfactant has been found to increase the physiological activity of imidazole, without improving the physical properties of the oil carrier, while perchloroethylene has been found to directly increase lipid solubility.
 Male CD- 1 mice were fed diets containing 0 (control), 10, 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg/day piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and 0.05% sodium phenobarbital (NaPB) and male F344 rats were fed diets containing 0 (control), 100, 550, 1050, and 1850 mg/kg/day PBO and 0.5% NaPB for periods of 7 and 42 days.
 In both species PBO and NaPB increased relative liver weight and whereas PBO produced a midzonal (mouse) or periportal/midzonal (rat) hypertrophy, NaPB produced a centrilobular hypertrophy.
 In the rat, individual cell necrosis was also observed at 42 days after high doses of PBO.
 Replicative DNA synthesis, assessed as the hepatocyte labeling index following implantation of 7-day osmotic pumps containing 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine during Study Days 0-7 and 35-42, was increased in mice given 300 mg/kg/day PBO and NaPB for 7 days and in rats given 550 and 1050 mg/kg/day PBO and NaPB for 7 days and 1050 mg/kg/day PBO for 42 days.
 While PBO had no effect on body weights in mice, the body weights of rats given 550, 1050, and 1850 mg/kg/day PBO for 42 days were reduced to 92, 89, and 70% of control, respectively.
 PBO induced microsomal cytochrome P450 content and mixed function oxidase activities in the mouse and rat, although the effects were less marked than those produced by NaPB.
 In summary, this data demonstrates that PBO can produce liver enlargement in the mouse and the rat which is associated with induction of xenobiotic metabolism, hypertrophy, and hyperplasia.
 The hepatic effects of PBO in the mouse were similar to but less marked than those produced by NaPB.
 In the rat high doses of PBO were hepatotoxic and resulted in a marked reduction in body weight.
 Thus while the reported formation of eosinophilic nodules in mouse liver by PBO may occur by a mechanism(s) similar to that of NaPB and other nongenotoxic enzyme inducers, the reported tumor formation in rats at greater than the maximum tolerated dose is most likely associated with marked enzyme induction in conjunction with a regenerative hyperplasia resulting from PBO-induced hepatotoxicity.

 Print this article You can easily get rid of insects either at your home or office by implementing a single or multi-faceted approach.
 You can adopt varied approaches to exterminate insects and all need to be deployed under different circumstances.
 Some extermination processes require trained and experienced personnel to execute (See Reference 3).

 Antimetabolites Antimetabolites
 Antimetabolites contain hormones, amino acids and vitamins.
 Even though antimetabolites are not metabolized in the same way, they starve insects by disrupting their metabolic cycle.
 You can also use antimetabolites like sulphonamides to prevent the development of microorganisms that supply essential nutrients for insect's growth.
 Contact Sprays Sprays
 Utilize the services of professional exterminators and certified pest control operators who apply mothproofing chemicals and contact sprays on rugs, carpets and upholstered furniture.
 Contact sprays are made from either oil or water solutions.
 Rooms with poor ventilation are sprayed with water-based solutions while oil-based solutions are used in rooms with good ventilation.
 But before you spray, consider the best solution for your textiles.
 If your materials are likely to be stained or discolored from water-based solution, then use oil-based solution.
 Repellents Repellents
 Use insect repellents to discourage insect infestation at home.
 Repellents containing naphthalene and p-dichlorobenzene exterminate carpet beetles and moths.
 If you use these two chemicals in high concentrations, the released vapor kills moth's young larvae and eggs.
 Fumigants Fumigants
 Fumigants are toxic gases and liquids; only professionals should handle these chemicals.
 Chemicals for fumigation have volatile infinitesimal molecules that contain one or more halogens such as chlorine or fluorine.
 One advantage of fumigants is that they kill insects in all stages of their growth, though they do not protect your home from reinfestation.
 The disadvantage of fumigates is that they are expensive to use because they require certain equipment like fumigation chambers in addition to trained personnel.
 All fumigants need careful handling, because their toxicity can result in fire or explosion.

 PESTICIDES AND CANCER CANCER
 An edited transcript of a lecture given by Professor Samuel Epstein, 1993.
 He is Professor of Occupational and Environmental Medicine at the School of Public Health, University of Illinois, California.
 A Sheffield farmer who is campaigning against diazinon, a compound of sheep dip, because of neurobehavioural problems in both sheep and farmers, was assured by the Ministry of Health that there is no basis for linking such problems with this particular organophosphate.
 This official denial of any link reflects both an ignorance of the literature, and an automatic reflex denial on problems of causation.
 There is, in fact, a substantive literature on neurobehavioural effects of organophosphates in general, and diazinon in particular.
 Cancer treatment is at times damaging damaging
 While the cancer rate is increasing, our ability to treat and cure cancer has not materially improved for decades.
 Although there have been remarkable successes with some of the rare cancers, childhood cancers, some lymphomas and testicular cancer, some of these successes may be more apparent than real.
 For instance, children who have been treated successfully for acute leukaemia with anti-metabolites - 6-mercaptopurine among others - have a 10 to 20-fold greater chance of getting subsequent cancers from the treatment itself.
 In addition, there's a wide range of other delayed toxic effects.
 When you examine most cancers for which chemotherapy is used, namely cancers of epithelial organs such as breast, gut etc., once they are past the localised stage there is no evidence that chemotherapy is of any value, despite contrary assertions by the cancer establishments in New Zealand, Britain and the USA.
 Some data indicate that people who leave the cancer untreated do better, because treatment in many instances is so toxic that it not only damages the quality of life but also shortens life.
 This contrasts with the hyperoptimistic claims periodically made, the basis for which is usually what is known as initial tumour response, a shrinkage of the tumour.
 A 75% shrinkage in tumour size is hailed as the latest cure.
 But such "cured" patients live no longer than those who were not treated at all, and in fact often die earlier.
 Another factor is massive permeation of our air, food and water and workplace with synthetic carcinogens over the last few decades.
 The US began manufacturing synthetic organic chemicals in 1940, and by the mid-1980s about 5 billion pounds were being produced annually.
 Amongst the major classes of these chemicals are pesticides.
 Cancer epidemic epidemic
 It is difficult to interest the average person in the issue of pesticides until you point out that:- that:-
 (a) we are facing a major epidemic of cancer, and and
 (b) pesticides are clearly linked to this.
 For the chronic neurobehavioural problems which we're seeing increasingly in people who have been exposed to organophosphates, we don't have a national database.
 So when industry asks where the epidemiological evidence is, the answer is that, with the exception of cancer, we don't have any registry on most other chronic diseases from immunological to reproductive, although one or two countries have registers for birth defects.
 Furthermore, most carcinogens also induce other chronic toxic effects.
 The "average" carcinogen not only produces cancer, it also inhibits immune response and can be reproductively toxic.
 So, from the point of view of human impact, cancer is the most important expression of the new petrochemical era, the runaway technology of the twentieth century.
 Evidence Evidence
 Evidence on the carcinogenicity of pesticides goes back for decades, with overwhelming data from animal experiments that have been repeated ad nauseam nationally and internationally.
 There's a consensus that a chemical that has been shown to be carcinogenic in animal tests must also be carcinogenic in humans.
 A reason why we don't have epidemiological data on a wide range of industrial chemicals, including pesticides, is that the industries concerned have created impediments and blocks to the development of such data.
 That's another big topic on its own.
 Over and above the experimental data from animal tests, we have studies from farmers all over the world showing major increases in overall cancer rates - a wide range of cancers including Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, leukaemias, multiple myelomas.
 Rates of increase in leukaemias and multiple myelomas in the US over the last few decades are in excess of 100%.
 Drift Drift
 As regards the nature of exposure of the individual householder or citizen to pesticides, and evidence linking their exposure to cancer, we know there is massive drift when pesticides are applied, particularly from aerial application.
 In general, less than 5% applied aerially reaches the target.
 It's a substantial drift and it can happen not only from aerial application but also from urban mosquito control programmes and lawn spraying.
 Of about 35 chemicals used as pesticides in lawn spraying in this country, as in the US, some are unequivocal carcinogens, including 2,4-D; 10 are reproductive toxins, and 14-15 are known to be immunotoxic, etc.
 Food Food
 Additional lines of evidence come from what we call "risk assessments" of dietary contaminants.
 We know that foodstuffs are contaminated with a very wide range of carcinogenic pesticides.
 Very limited data are available in this country, but according to the last data from the Ministry of Health and MAF, celery has in the region of 17 pesticide residues, about 10 of which are carcinogenic, and an apple may have as many as 5-10 carcinogenic pesticides, so you're dealing with food which has massive and pervasive contamination.
 The EPA under the Reagan/Bush administration wasn't exactly a progressive organisation.
 In fact, amongst the crimes of Reagan and Bush which will go down in history are their emasculation of Federal regulatory apparatus, with the appointment of chiefs and heads of Federal agencies hostile to the legislative mandates.
 The Dellaney Amendment was a 1958 law, an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act which basically says, "Thou shalt not add any level of carcinogenic pesticides to the foodstuffs".
 This was an important law because it recognised that we don't know any way of stating safe levels of carcinogens; and it also insulated the Federal agencies EPA and FDA from political pressures from the chemical industry etc.
 But in 1988, under the Bush administration, the EPA - illegally, in our view - revoked the Dellaney Law and introduced the concept of "acceptable risk".
 This allows one pesticide on one particular food item if the risk for that is no more than one in a hundred thousand cancers per year.
 This is based on attempts to extrapolate from animal data.
 There are problems in that these numbers are highly relaxed in terms of protecting the public.
 The EPA permissible level translates nationally to 30-40 extra cancer deaths per year.
 However, if you take the more realistic position that we eat many food items in a meal, and every one might be contaminated by 5 to 10 to 15 different pesticides, then according to the Reagan/Bush data, the figures for aggregate risk come to about 50-60,000 extra cancer deaths a year.
 Among many other lines of evidence, one that relates to dogs is quite interesting.
 Dog owners who have had their lawns treated with a chemical will find that their dogs will die, at a six times greater rate than others, of a variety of problems, particularly Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
 Breast Cancer Cancer
 In many instances, the American Cancer Society has demonstrated actual hostility to prevention.
 For example, they refused to support toxic substances legislation, they refused to support the Dellaney Law, which forbids the actual and deliberate addition of chemical carcinogens to foodstuffs.
 There's a long track record of these acts of indifference.
 For these reasons, I and others have come to the conclusion that the only way of persuading the American Cancer Society to develop more responsible policies is to threaten them with an economic boycott.
 In fact, a variety of groups all over the US, particularly women's breast cancer groups, are in the process of organising such a boycott.
 Breast cancer is a subject that is creating a great deal of interest in the US, Britain and New Zealand.
 Rates of breast cancer have increased from the 1950s to the mid-1980s by almost 60%.
 The established risk factors for breast cancer include genetic, familial factors; they also include reproductive factors:
 late menstruation, late menopause, no children, and a so-called high-fat diet.
 The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society have spent $1.5 billion in the last two decades on cancer research that focuses mainly on nutritional factors; and they still claim that a high fat diet itself is an important risk factor.
 Well, a series of epidemiological studies - what we call case control in cobalt studies - have clearly shown no link between breast cancer and a high fat diet itself.
 So these risk factors can only account for about 20% of all breast cancers, and they can in no way account for increase in incidence and increase in mortality from breast cancer over the last few decades.
 The intriguing point about all the nutritional studies from the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute, in this country and elsewhere, is that none of these studies has looked into the question of dietary contaminants.
 None at all.
 Yet when you look into the matter of dietary contaminants, a wide range of lines of evidence become apparent, which create a very strong presumption of causal relationship between contaminants and breast cancer.
 First, the carcinogenicity of the organochlorine pesticides DDT, aldrin, dieldrin, chlor, heptachlorine etc.
 has been known since the late 1960s.
 Furthermore, the three major studies made so far of women with breast cancer have all shown excess of these organochlorines, and also PCBs, in breasts with cancer as opposed to those without cancer.
 Then we have the "Israel Anomaly".
 In the mid-1970s the Israeli Ministry of Health forced major reduction in levels of organochlorine pesticide residue contaminants in dairy products and related foods, and what we then saw was a major decrease, by 30%, in premenopausal mortality from breast cancer.
 This was a unique phenomenon; especially since at that time reproductive risk factors were increasing:
 women were having fewer children and they were eating more fat, and yet this occurred.
 Who is responsible?
 Probably the greatest responsibility for the cancer epidemic we're faced with lies with you.
 Your lack of interest in the past, your lack of involvement, your unwillingness to develop coherent strategies, your unwillingness to challenge authority - these have created a vacuum in decision-making, that has been filled by professional groups with mindsets, with conflicts of interests, in some instances with close relationships with the chemical industries - professional groups that are uninterested in prevention.
 By your quiescence and your acquiescence, you have allowed these situations to develop.
 I think the responsibility for the cancer epidemic is reflected in the Pogo cartoon:
 "I see the enemy, and the enemy is us".
 It is high time that empowerment and democracy and decision-making on these vital issues should be at least shared by you, if you should not indeed take a more prominent role.
 The uptake of the aminoacid biosynthesis inhibitor, used as the broad-spectrum herbicide ingredient, glyphosate (N-[phosphonomethyl]-glycine) was investigated in E.
 coli as a model to study mechanisms of cell resistance to antimetabolites as drugs and pesticides.
 Unlike the glyphosate-degrading Arthrobacter sp.
 strain for which the first successful measurement of glyphosate uptake and its inhibition by orthophosphate was reported [15], E.
 coli K-12 cannot take up this inhibitor either in the presence of orthophosphate, or after a prolonged starvation for it.
 However, cells made competent after an overnight cold CaCl2 exposure followed by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) treatment could take up this compound (K m for glyphosate uptake, 274 M).
 Neither amino acids, belonging to a single transport system, nor orthophosphate gave essential inhibition of glyphosate uptake by these cells.
 Cancer cells lose their ability to be controlled in natural growth and reproduction by the body and multiply very fast, often migrating to other parts of the body in addition to the original site.
 Normal cells know when to stop growing, particularly in repair situations, but cancer cells are different from normal cells in ignoring the body�s signals to stop growth.
 The cancer cells become erratic and keep multiplying rapidly and, if not controlled or killed, the cancer cells disrupt normal and essential cell functions, crowd out normal tissue of organs and eventually, if not stopped, cause organ failure resulting in death.
 Chemotherapy (chemo) and radiation are two of only three sanctioned medical procedures (surgery is the third) utilized in the treatment of cancer.
 Chemo involves antimetabolites that attempt to disrupt cancer cell growth and reproduction and cytotoxic (cell poisoning) drugs to kill cancer cells.
 Chemo and radiation are also utilized to shrink the cancer tumor size prior to surgery, with an objective to make removal both less invasive to the patient and more effective in removing the cancerous tumor or tumors.
 Chemotherapy was first developed as a U.S.
 Army poison gas program during World War II, a fact seldom revealed to those in treatment.
 Chemotherapy is the chosen sanctioned therapy when cancer has metastasized, or spread beyond the original site of origin.
 Cancer has metastasized in cancer patients in 50-70% of diagnosed cancer cases, a condition status that unfortunately reduces success statistics for "cure." Control by reduced reproduction of cancer cells and tumor size shrinkage are much more frequent results than a factual "cure" and are positive developments in cancer treatment.
 Success rates for chemotherapy have been highest in ovarian, testicular and Duke�s C cancers.
 Cures by chemotherapy and radiation regimens in other cancers are less successful involving all-to-often misleading statistics.
 As an example, cancer is considered cured if a patient is cancer-free for 5 years after treatment; even if cancer reoccurs in year 6.
 This equates cancer remission for a 5 year period with cure and, while certainly a positive development, the word "cure" should equate to "gone" or cancer being no longer present to any extent in any amount.
 While approximately 50% of cancer patients receive chemotherapy in some form, the success rate according to Dr.
 Ralph Moss, author of Questioning Chemotherapy, is only 2 to 5% for a cure.
 Pharmaceutical manufacturers and organized medicine present more optimistic industry success rates at about 25%, with rates varying by type and stage of the form of cancer treated and the definition of "cure." If cancer, particularly breast cancer, is "cured," why do most Oncologist insist on a post-operative "chemotherapy" treatment plan that is debilitating due to side effects and financially a heavy burden even though they, "got it all?".
 Radiation treatments for cancer, or radiotherapy, involve the use of radioactivity including ionizing radiation from Gamma-rays, X-Rays or Cobalt-60 as killing agents in therapy.
 Approximately 60% of cancer patients receive radiation in some form.
 Radiation is aimed at killing the malignant cells and tissues involved in cancer.
 Radiation can in fact damage cancer cells, but radiation can also cause secondary cancers after the primary cancer has been treated; thus being classified as a carcinogen defined as a cancer-causing agent.
 In addition to being carcinogens, chemotherapy drugs and radiation are in many instances classified as free radicals responsible for cancer-causing mutations to the body's deoxyribonucleic acid, better known as DNA.
 Free radicals are in actuality molecules that have lost an electron and are therefore "unpaired," similar to a sparking wire uncontrolled in the body.
 The "unpaired" molecules "steal" an electron from any nearby molecule in an attempt to replace their missing electron, leading to the creation of more free radicals and initiating a chain reaction.
 Excessive free radicals in the body are to be avoided and a serious detriment to attaining and maintaining good health.
 As with any prescription pharmaceutical drug, the prescribing physician must evaluate risk versus reward of the drug or drugs prescribed, with the presumption the reward of curing the treated disease is more beneficial than the risk of the prescription drug's known bad side effects in the body.
 In prescribing post-operative chemotherapy after claiming "we got it all," especially with breast cancer patients, it is hoped a thorough evaluation of the risk of injecting a patient's body with additional poison carcinogens known to cause serious side effects such as fatigue, a suppressed immune response and even cancer, is conclusive in determining the possible reward of killing cancer cells that supposedly are no longer present more than offsets the certain and serious negatives from the treatment itself! itself!
 Many chemotherapy drugs (antimetabolites) are aimed at controlling the growth and reproduction of cancer cells, instead of destroying cancer cells.
 Chemotherapy is similar to spraying pesticides on plants to kill 99% of the bugs.
 The problem is the super bugs in the 1% that survive reproduce even more rapidly and are the most resistant to the chemo drugs and radiation poisons supposed to control them.
 A secondary problem is while shrinkage of a tumor is a positive development, especially prior to surgery, tumor shrinkage too often has been made synonymous with cure by the Cancer industry and this unfortunately is not true because a shrunken malignant tumor is still a malignant tumor if it is still present in the body! body!
 Chemotherapy Drug Types and Purpose Purpose
 Chemotherapy drugs are classified in five categories:
 � Alkylating cytotoxic agents:
 The genetic material or DNA of a cell is composed of molecules named bases.
 These bases must be duplicated and paired precisely when the cell divides.
 Alkylating agents interfere with the orderly process of bases pairing, thus preventing successful cell division.
 The drugs Cytoxan and L-Pam are in this category.
 � Antimetabolites:
 Antimetabolites are chemical compounds absorbed by the cell, similar in fact to vitamins and other nutrients.
 Antimetabolites disrupt the cell metabolic process.
 Methotrexate, 5-FU and 6-MP are examples.
 � Antibiotics:
 Antibiotics are designed to fight bacterial infections by disrupting the synthesis of RNA, a substance the cell needs to make essential proteins.
 Cancer therapy antibiotics include Bleomycin and Adriamycin.
 � Steroids:
 Prednizone and estrogen supposedly work in cancer treatment by preventing production of proteins and key enzymes, but the exact process is unknown to date.
 � Miscellaneous:
 Vinblastine and Vincristine actively prevent cell replication or doubling.
 L-Alparaginase is an enzyme that destroys asparagines, an amino acid some cancer cells must source from the blood stream and cannot produce.
 More chemo drugs are developed almost daily, with advances hopefully being made to make the drugs more targeted in killing cancer cells without nausea and hair loss, and less damaging to the bone marrow, immune cells, nutrient delivery and creation of other cancers.
 Chemotherapy and Radiation Status Today Today
 What is most disturbing is mainstream medicine dictates only chemotherapy, radiation and surgery are currently accepted treatments for cancer, with even nutrition unbelievably considered an alternative form of treatment.
 Cancer is a disease that destroys normal cell function and in turn tissue and organs; i.e.
 a disease of abnormal metabolism.
 Up to 40% of cancer patients are dying of malnutrition, but this aspect of cancer and the contributions to malnutrition due to treatments of chemotherapy and radiation are all but ignored.
 Why can�t the main stream medical establishment embrace the contributions of nutrition, vitamin therapy (Vitamin C particularly) and immune response enhancement to fighting cancer, in addition to other effective alternative methods?
 Dollars?
 This should not be an "us versus them" or "pharmaceutical/surgery versus natural" or any other ridiculous focus other than taking the best of all health sciences to cure the cancer of the patient.
 Why should anything be excluded that can be beneficial simply because it is natural versus synthetic and cannot be patented to produce billions of dollars?
 If chemotherapy, radiation and surgery are so successful after hundreds of millions of dollars in research, why has the cancer death rate per 100,000 population TRIPLED since 1900?
 All but ignoring the source of food for cancer is sugar and the destructive effects of chemotherapy and radiation on the immune response is unexplainable.
 Hopefully extensive research will be done in the future to reduce or eliminate the negatives of the treatments and statistics relating to success will be accurate, without marketing gimmicks to make results appear better than reality.
 Cancer patients deserve the truth and access to any treatment or substance that can be beneficial to managing symptoms or contribute to a cure.
 Dangers of Chemo and Radiation Radiation
 Chemotherapy patients are 14 times more likely to develop leukemia than patients who have not undergone chemo and chemo patients are 6 times more likely to develop cancer of the bones, joints and soft tissue.
 Chemotherapy causes the barrier of the intestine to become permeable and leaky, allowing detrimental bacteria and fungi to enter the bloodstream (fibromyalgia possible cause?).
 Nutrient digestion is impaired by destruction of the villi in the intestinal wall of the small intestine.
 Chemo suppresses the immune response while severely depleting Taurine, a key ingredient of bile needed for fat-soluble vitamin absorption, cell membrane integrity and calcium/sodium balance.
 Most forms of chemotherapy cause depletion of Vitamin A and interfere with intestinal absorption of Vitamin K, needed for proper blood density.
 Dermatitis on the skin is common, while hemoglobin (red blood cell) levels are lowered after chemotherapy.
 Radiation therapy damages bone marrow by X-ray or Gamma-ray emission, while causing a severe decline in needed Vitamin C concentration in the bone marrow and the body�s sodium/potassium balance.
 Further, radiation therapy shrinks the spleen and thymus gland, while causing a reduction in white blood cell counts known as lycopenia.
 Regarding the immune response, both helper T-cells and suppressor T-cells are reduced.
 Bottom line, risk versus reward is a major question in using chemotherapy and radiation in cancer treatment.
 Many have benefited in increased life span, but too often with limited cure achievement, but there are aids to making these treatments more effective while reducing negative side effects many times ignored.
 Can Chemotherapy and Radiation Be More Effective?
 Are there ways to make radiation and chemotherapy more effective against cancer and less destructive to white cells and red cells produced by the bone marrow that are essential for oxygen and nutrient delivery in the body and thus energy itself?
 A study by D.J.
 Allendorf and associates presented at the Center for Mind-Body Medicine Comprehensive Care Symposium in 2003 reported, �Oral treatment with whole glucan particles may be a useful therapeutic intervention following radiation exposure to accelerate myeloid [bone marrow] recovery and increase survival after radiation exposure.� exposure.�
 Dr.
 Myra Patchen and associates from Harvard U.
 published the following results, �These studies suggest that glucan, a macrophage activator, can synergize the G-CSF to further accelerate hemopoietic [formation of blood cells] regeneration and increase survival following radiation-induced myelosuppression [bone marrow suppression].� suppression].�
 As to chemotherapy, A.
 A.
 Tohamy in a peer reviewed article in November 2003 published:
 �This protective effect of beta-glucan could be attributed to its scavenging ability to trap free-radicals produced during the biotransformation of these anti-neoplastic [abnormal tissue growth chemotherapy] drugs.
 Beta-glucan also markedly restored the mitotic [cell division] activity of bone marrow cells that had been suppressed by the anti-neoplastic drugs.
 These results indicate that in addition to known immunopotentiating activity of beta-glucan, it plays a role in reducing genotoxicity [capability to cause cancer] induced by anti-neoplastic [abnormal tissue growth] drugs during cancer chemotherapy.� chemotherapy.�
 These research studies and presentations translate to mean Beta 1,3/1,6 glucan helps protect against free radicals produced by chemotherapy drugs and radiation attempting to stop cancer cell multiplication.
 A major damage factor from chemotherapy and radiation is in inhibiting and damaging bone marrow and spleen production of blood cells � white and red.
 Dr.
 Myra Patchen in peer-reviewed publications further reported, reported,
 �Both glucan P [particulate taken orally as a supplement] and glucan-F enhanced the recovery of peripheral blood white cell numbers, platelet numbers and hematocrit [red blood cell concentration] values.
 In addition, both agents increased endogenous pluripotent hemopoietic stem cell numbers in sublethally irradiated mice.
 � In the spleen, all aspects of hemopoiesis [formation of blood cells] increased after glucan administration.� administration.�
 Beta 1,3/1,6 glucan and the potent form of MG Glucan ingested orally:
 � Nutritionally aids in protecting the white immune cells from damage from the cytotoxicity (cell poisons) of chemotherapy and radiation.
 � Nutritionally aids in replacing needed white immune cells, red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow after treatment.
 � Nutritionally aids �Phagocytosis� by white immune cells that ingest and devour dead or damaged cancer and other cells, thus removing toxic damaged and dead cells from the body.
 � Nutritionally helps promote an improved immune response to enhance God�s protection for us against other health invaders including fungus, bacteria and viruses.
 � Nutritionally promotes replacement of red blood cells in the bone marrow to orally aid in restoring energy and reducing nausea by enhancing delivery of oxygen to cells.
 MG Glucan is a more potent form of Beta 1,3/1,6 glucan due to a U.S.
 Patented process for isolating the nutritional immune cell potentiator, with amounts of 20 mg to 40 mg daily suggested.
 At minimum 10 mg should be taken orally before sleep as the immune response is most active in repair and activity in deep sleep.
 MG Glucan taken orally will additionally aid nutritionally in promoting wellness from leucopenia, hair loss, nausea, pain and vomiting.
 Additional beneficial natural substances include:
 Glutamine is essential as a supplement in both radiation and chemotherapy by increasing the susceptibility of cancer cells to the cytotoxic [poison] effects of the chemicals and radiation.
 To minimize diarrhea, take 18,000 mg (18 grams) of glutamine for 3 days before chemo with 30,000 mg (30 grams) per day for 14 days afterward to minimize pain and mouth sores (oral mucositis), with beta carotene also helping reduce the severity of mouth ulcers.
 Thymic protein A (TPA) counteracts for many the suppression of the immune cells for many, while while
 DMSO considerably reduces the toxic side effects of Cyclophosphamide, a common chemo drug.
 Vitamin A with 25,000 IU per day (do not exceed except under physician guidance), guidance),
 Vitamin E with 400 IU daily and and
 Vitamin C (intravenous under physician supervision preferably) are nutritionally beneficial.
 Hyperthermia, or heat therapy, often increases the effectiveness of chemo.
 Whey protein enhances benefits of radiation therapy by depleting the glutathione content of cancer cells.
 Shark liver oil with alkyl glycerols are useful to women with uterine cancer prior to radium and X-ray therapy to reduce treatment damage to non-cancer cells.
 CoQ10 with 200 mg daily oxygenates cells while boosting cell metabolism to replenish damaged cells.
 Use N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) with 1,800 mg per day for nutritional aid in reducing nausea, vomiting and bladder hemorrhaging, , plus the the
 Herb ginger, preferably in a tea.
 Supplement with Taurine of 2,000 mg per day recommended, recommended,
 Grape seed extract to slow cell mutation, mutation,
 Astragalus to help regain cell function, function,
 Proteolytic enzymes with bromelain to diminish cancer cell integrity (7 tablets 3 times daily suggested) and and
 Cat�s claw for toxicity relief.
 A sick mind cannot help a sick body.
 Fran Di Giacomo, author and cancer survivor says, �Laughter frees the mind from the shackles of despair and, in turn, empowers the body.� Where there is humor together with a spiritual promise, there is hope for the present and future in cancer and life.
 MG Glucan oral intake is suggested at minimum two weeks before beginning chemotherapy and/or radiation treatments and to continue for at minimum 60 days afterward.
 In summary, make informed decisions and utilize all beneficial sources.

 Abstract Abstract
 Reproductive toxicity has been a topic of increasing interest and concern in recent years, generating controversy in association with danger to humans and other living things.
 A veritable host of chemicals is known to be involved, encompassing a wide variety of classes, both organic and inorganic.
 Exposure is pervasive and virtually unavoidable due to contamination of air, water, ground, food, beverages, drugs, and household items.
 The corresponding adverse effects on reproduction are numerous.
 There is uncertainty regarding mode of action although various theories have been advanced, e.g., disruption of the CNS, DNA attack, enzyme inhibition, interference with hormonal action, and insult to membranes and proteins.
 This review provides extensive evidence for involvement of oxidative stress (OS) and electron transfer (ET) as a unifying theme.
 Successful application is made to all of the main classes of toxins, in addition to large numbers of miscellaneous types.
 We believe it is not coincidental that the vast majority of these substances incorporate ET functionalities (quinone, metal complex, ArNO2, or conjugated iminium) either per se or in metabolites, potentially giving rise to reactive oxygen species (ROS) by redox cycling.
 Some categories, e.g., peroxides and radiation, appear to generate ROS by non-ET routes.
 For completeness, other theories are also addressed; a multifaceted approach appears to be the most logical.
 Our framework should increase understanding and contribute to preventative measures, such as use of antioxidants (AOs).
 The ET-OS theory has recently been used as the central theme by us in reviews of biomechanisms involved with anti-infective drugs, anticancer agents, and carcinogens.
 Pests, which include insects, can be defined as:
 any organism causing injury, danger, or annoyance to man, property, or animals.
 In controlled growing conditions insects reduce yield and marketability, increase cropping expenses, are vectors for disease, and at worst, can result in entire crop loss.
 The best way to deal with the problem is to avoid it.
 Insects may enter the grow room on you, your pets, through cracks, new plants, or even hitch a ride on the fresh air intake.
 If you have been out of doors or tending other house plants, make sure to wash your hands and exposed areas, while changing clothes or protective outerwear.
 Ducting into the grow area should contain a fine screen or HEPA filter.
 Keep in mind, that this may restrict airflow significantly.
 Increased fan requirements and/or inline booster fans may be required.
 Make sure to clean the intake screen or replace filters often, as dust and other build up will further restrict airflow.
 Spray your filters with a Pyrethroid with a long term residual-Permethrins work well and have very low toxicity.
 Before introducing a new crop into the grow room, fumigate or scrub the area thoroughly.
 Total Release Fumigators do a reasonably good job of debugging the area.
 Be careful when using these types of products.
 Some are lethal to plants, humans, pets, and can ignite fires.
 Follow the directions to the letter.
 The safest and least toxic are pyrethrum based.
 Quarantine new introductions before setting them out into a healthy grow room.
 Watch for signs of insects and disease.
 If cloning, keep in mind that the longer a plant is in production, the greater the chances are of developing a problem.
 Make sure that the grow area is well sealed.
 Large sheets of polythene make an excellent barrier to prevent entry.
 Take care to seal around doorways.
 Non-insecticide botanical extracts such as a garlic spray help to make a plant less visually appealing to a passing extract.
 It is also true that garlic does have some insecticide like properties if sprayed directly onto pests.
 It is likely, no matter how careful the grower is, that at one time or another a harmful insect will appear.
 Now, the big question is, what are some effective ways to deal with the problem?
 It is not the intention of this article to go into any great depth on particular insects there are many resources on the subject.
 But, there are some suggestions as to ways to effectively, and safely deal with them.
 Obviously, you need to identify the type(s) of insects you have discovered while making your routine checks.
 Some may be harmless or even beneficial; others are your worst nightmare.
 Know your enemies-get to know the life cycle.
 For example, the two-spotted spider mite can produce a new generation in as little as three days, under warm dry conditions.
 In cooler, damper conditions it may take as long as 20 days.
 In this example, the growing conditions might dictate the frequency of treatments.
 Most insects which attack indoor and greenhouse crops have piercing and sucking mouthparts, while outdoor pests more commonly have chewing mouthparts.
 These pests include spider mites, aphids, thrips, and whitefly.
 Some species of spider mites are specific to certain types of crops.
 Knowing how the insect feeds (sucking vs.
 chewing) will help you to determine the type of insecticide you need because of the mode of entry.
 There are five general modes of entry for insecticide:
 Stomach Poisons - chewing insects are more susceptible than sucking insects.
 Systemic - act in plant tissue, insect eats then dies.
 Contact Sprays - only kills on contact, good for rapidly moving insects.
 Residual - organic and inorganic, absorbed by the insects nervous system.
 Fumigants - gets into insect's respiratory system.
 There are six general classes of insecticides that affect the plants nervous system.
 The type you choose should be dictated by the type of crop you're growing and time until harvest.
 Organophosphates - low persistence (breaks down readily), high dermal toxicity (easily absorbed by skin), low to very high toxicity.
 Dursban has been banned for home use by the EPA- effective June 2000.
 Carbamates - low to medium persistence, low to high toxicity, low dermal toxicity.
 Chlorinated Hydrocarbons - high persistence, easily absorbed by fat cells, low to medium toxicity.
 Botanicals - often the best choice for crops intended for human consumption, high toxicity (usually to insects), low persistence.
 This includes natural pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum extracts), nicotine sulphate sulphate
 Synthetic Pyrethroids - similar to botanicals, low to medium toxicity, low persistence.
 Bacterial Fermentation By Products - effective against internal parasites ( such as leaf miners), systemic, medium persistence, low toxicity.
 Other chemical controls which do not affect the insects central nervous system:
 Bacterial agents, such as BT.
 Insect growth regulators.
 Anti-metabolites.
 Pheromones.
 Feeding Deterrents, such as neem oil, garlic, and hot pepper extracts extracts
 Repellents, such as plant extracted terpines (essential sprays).
 Always follow the manufacturers directions for frequency of application.
 Take the time to schedule applications to follow the crops life cycle, as there are a recommended limit of days to harvest after applications.
 Many will break down faster in high light conditions and in the root zone at lowered pH levels.
 External products will breakdown, but systemic's may take longer to flush out than expected.
 Pests can develop resistance to the same class of insecticide and/or the A.I.
 (active ingredient).
 Keep in mind new generations may arise within five days, so there seems to be an accelerated rate of evolution going on in their world.
 So different A.I.
 or modes of entry should be applied in rotation.
 Dip entire young seedlings or clones in a mild contact solution such as insecticidal soaps containing fatty acids, or hot pepper or neem extracts.
 Always try sprays, etc.
 on a few trial plants first, as some plant varieties are more sensitive than others.
 If problems have been persistent in the past you may consider a systemic treatment, if accounting for days required before harvest and environmental conditions.
 Keep in mind that many label recommendations are intended for outdoor or greenhouse crops, which often receive higher light levels, rain, etc.
 than what is more common to indoor grow rooms.
 You can spray a deterrent on or around plants frequently, even if the problem does not persist.
 Spraying a contact spray such as pyrethrum around the plants is also good for preventing infestations, and if insects do persist spray directly onto the plants almost up to harvest.
 No matter how safe the product is, always be sure to rinse your plants near harvest.
 Take care not to develop mold from drenched leaves and flowers, and watch for sunscald from wet foliage in high light conditions.
 When using contact sprays, be sure to maintain a safe distance from the plant in order to prevent burning of the foliage.
 Surfactants and wetting agents increase the efficiency of application and rinsing of insecticides, only small amounts are required.
 Insecticides are not the only solution, whether organic or inorganic.
 Prevention is the best step.
 Beneficial insects, which are specific predators to your problem are also often a viable chemical free solution.
 Insects have plagued man since the beginning, so there is a great deal of information and products to choose from.
 Take the time to get to know the problem and how best to effectively deal with it.
 1.0 INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION
 This document contains information on protecting U.S.
 Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) trust resources in Region 2 from pesticide applications.
 Region 2 (Southwest Region) of the Service includes Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.
 The document serves as the regional pesticide recommendations (RPR) for Region 2 and will be updated when new species are listed or new information becomes available.
 The Service regional pesticide coordinator in Austin, Texas, should be contacted at 512-490-0057 for information on pesticides or protection measures not covered in the RPR.
 The purpose of the RPR is to provide recommendations to Service personnel, regulatory agencies, and pesticide users for pesticide applications involving Service trust resources of (1) national wildlife refuges and fish hatcheries, (2) migratory birds, and (3) threatened and endangered (T&E) species that have been listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
 The document specifically provides pesticide protection measures that can be used to protect Federally-listed species, species proposed for listing, and critical habitat.
 Recommended protection measures in the RPR may be modified on a case-by-case basis with additional information.
 However, the RPR cannot be used in lieu of section 7 consultations or section 10 permits as required under the Endangered Species Act.
 Recommendations in the RPR do not constitute rules, regulations, requirements, or project evaluation criteria of the Service.
 The recommendations also do not create or establish any legal obligations, binding effects, minimum standards, or criteria to be adopted by the private sector or by government agencies at the Federal, state, or local level.
 Note - Any product, active ingredient, or formulation of a pesticide addressed in this document does not infer recommendation or endorsement by the U.
 S.
 Fish and Wildlife Service for its use.
 2.0 GENERAL INFORMATION FOR PESTICIDE APPLICATIONS APPLICATIONS
 2.1 Regulatory Compliance Compliance
 2.1.1 Federal statutory authorities authorities
 Unlawful uses of pesticides that potentially involve Service trust resources can have substantial penalties according to various Federal regulatory statutes.
 The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), as amended (16 U.S.C 153 et seq.), protects plant and animal species that have been listed by the Federal government under the act as either threatened or endangered.
 Civil penalties can be assessed under the ESA for up to $25,000 for knowing violations of the act and up to $500 for unknowing violations.
 Criminal penalties for individuals under the act include up to $100,000 in fines and one year imprisonment.
 The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 prohibits the killing of migratory birds and assesses penalties for up to $15,000 and six months imprisonment for misdemeanor violations.
 Felony violations by individuals under the act can involve up to $250,000 in fines and two years� imprisonment.
 The Bald Eagle Protection Act of 1940 assesses penalties for killing, poisoning, or disturbing both bald eagles and golden eagles with up to $5,000 in fines for civil penalties and up to $250,000 in fines and two years� imprisonment for a felony violation.
 The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 prohibits disturbing, injuring, or damaging plants and animals within a refuge.
 Criminal penalties under the act include up to $100,000 in fines and one year imprisonment.
 In addition to the aforementioned acts, penalties for unlawful pesticide use may also be assessed under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1947 (FIFRA), as amended (7 U.S.C.
 135 et seq.), and other regulatory statutes.
 2.1.2 The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (FIFRA)
 The U.
 S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates pesticides that are sold, distributed, or used in the United States by requiring either (1) full registration of a pesticide under FIFRA section 3; (2) exemption status for a pesticide under FIFRA section 18 for use in individual counties or states during emergency conditions; or (3) a special local need registration for a pesticide by an individual state under FIFRA section 24(c).
 Before registration can occur, EPA must make a determination that a pesticide will generally not cause unreasonable adverse effects on humans or the environment.
 In addition, a pesticide must be registered in a state by an appropriate state agency before it can be sold or used.
 A pesticide may be suspended after registration under FIFRA section 6(c)(1) if EPA determines that the pesticide is an imminent hazard that can jeopardize a listed species.
 A pesticide may only be used as specified by the pesticide label, and application of a pesticide other than as directed by the label is a FIFRA violation.
 The label is a legal document that regulates specific uses and applications of a pesticide.
 For example, only a limited number of pesticides are registered for use in waterbodies or wetlands.
 Pesticide use in these areas is restricted to aquatic pesticide formulations (piscicides, mosquito control agents, aquatic herbicides, etc.) that have a product label that specifically states that the pesticide is intended for aquatic use.
 Some pesticides such as 2, 4-D, glyphosate, and imazapyr have different formulations to allow use with both land and aquatic areas.
 2.1.3 Pesticide use and the Endangered Species Act Act
 Under the ESA, �take� of animal species listed as threatened or endangered is prohibited.
 Take of Federally-listed animal species includes harassing, harming, pursuing, hunting, shooting, wounding, killing, trapping, capturing, collecting, or attempting to engage in any such conduct.
 Take can only be exempted under limited circumstances through (1) incidental take provisions as authorized by a biological opinion in an ESA section 7 consultation or (2) an incidental take permit obtained under section 10 of the ESA.
 Incidental take refers to take that is incidental to, and not the purpose of, carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity (e.g., loss of individuals of a listed animal species through pesticide spray drift from nearby cropland).
 Pesticide use can cause take of listed animals through killing, harming, or harassment.
 As defined under 50 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) � 17.3, harm to listed animal species can include significant habitat modification or degradation that results in death or injury to listed species by impairing essential behavioral patterns such as breeding, feeding, or sheltering.
 Examples of harm to listed animal species that can be caused by pesticide applications include loss of prey species, abnormal behavioral changes, and induced sublethal effects (e.g., endocrine system disruption).
 Harassment of listed animal species under 50 CFR � 17.3 can be an intentional or negligent action (or omission of an action) that creates a likelihood of injury to a listed species by annoying individuals of the species to such an extent as to significantly disrupt normal behavior patterns that include (but are not limited to) breeding, feeding, or sheltering.
 Noise disturbance from pesticide application equipment can result in harassment through (1) nest abandonment by birds or (2) disruption of nesting colonies of shorebirds or wading birds.
 Although take does not apply to listed plant species, the ESA does prohibit the following actions in areas under Federal jurisdiction:
 (1) removal, damage, or destruction of endangered plant species and (2) removal of threatened plant species.
 In addition, actions that remove, damage, or cause destruction of endangered plant species in non-Federal areas that are in violation of state or local laws are prohibited.
 Experimental populations of listed species are protected by the ESA (as modified by special rules in 50 CFR � 17.80-17.85) against unlawful use of pesticides if these populations are (1) essential experimental populations on either public or private lands or (2) nonessential experimental populations on national parks or wildlife refuges.
 Candidate species and species proposed for listing do not have ESA protections until the time of listing; however, Federal agencies are required to confer with the Service about potential actions that may jeopardize the continued existence of proposed species.
 Federal agencies are also required to consult with Service on actions that can adversely modify critical habitat of listed species.
 2.1.4 ESA section 7 consultation for a pesticide action by a Federal agency agency
 Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA requires Federal agencies to ensure that any action (e.g., pesticide use) they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any Federally-listed threatened or endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat.
 Actions conducted by Federal agencies that involve pesticide use include, but are not limited to, the following examples:
 1.	Area-wide programs for control of insect pest species (cotton bollweevil, grasshopper, etc.), etc.),
 invasive species, rodents, or predators; and and
 2.	FIFRA authorizations such as pesticide registrations (section 3), emergency exemptions exemptions
 (section 18), and state-specific registrations (section 24(c)).
 In the event that a Federal agency concludes that its action �may affect� a listed species or designated critical habitat, the agency is required to consult with the Service regarding the degree of impact to the species from the agency�s action and the measures necessary to avoid or minimize adverse effects.
 Federal agencies involved with pesticide programs that can modify critical habitat through activities such as brush control or removal of prey species must consult with the Service.
 During ESA section 7 consultations, informal consultation between the Federal agency initiating the action and the Service may be used to determine whether (1) any adverse effects to listed species or critical habitat by the proposed action can be avoided or summarily minimized or (2) formal consultation is needed with the Service.
 To initiate formal consultation on pesticides, the Federal action agency is required to send information to the Service:
 1.	A description of the action to be considered; considered;
 2.	A description of the specific area that may be affected by the action; action;
 3.	A description of any listed species or critical habitat that may be affected by the action; action;
 4.	A description of the manner in which the action may affect any listed species or critical habitat and an analysis of any cumulative effects; effects;
 5.	Relevant reports including any environmental impact statement, environmental assessment, or biological assessment prepared; and and
 6.	Any other relevant available information on the action, the affected listed species, or critical habitat.
 If listed species or critical habitat are present in the action area, a biological assessment must be prepared by the Federal agency initiating the action pursuant to regulations implementing section 7 (e.g., 50 CFR � 402).
 Biological assessments made by Federal agencies may be done as part of the compliance for the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
 After a Federal action agency has provided any necessary documents such as a biological assessment, the Service will issue a biological opinion for the agency action.
 If the proposed action does not involve jeopardy for a listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat, the biological opinion will provide the Federal agency with an incidental take statement and non-discretionary reasonable and prudent measures (RPMs) to protect the species.
 In the event that jeopardy to a listed species (animal or plant) or adverse modification of critical habitat has been found by the Service for the action, the biological opinion will stipulate non-discretionary reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) that must be followed by the Federal agency to protect the species or critical habitat.
 2.1.5 ESA section 10 permit actions involving pesticide use on private, state, or local local
 	government lands lands
 Section 10 of the ESA authorizes the Service to issue permits allowing normally prohibited actions against Federally-listed species such as collection of species for scientific purposes.
 The section also gives the Service the authority to provide incidental take permits of listed animal species by non-Federal activities.
 Unless incidental take of listed animal species has previously been authorized by consultation under section 7 of the ESA, pesticide users who believe that their otherwise-lawful pesticide application(s) may cause take of a listed animal species should obtain an incidental take permit under section 10 (a)(1)(B).
 The permits may be issued by the Service to private individuals, associations, businesses, and to state, municipal, or tribal governments.
 Since the ESA does not prohibit killing or damaging listed plant species on non-Federal lands except in the event that killing or damaging of those plants is in violation of state or local law, incidental take permits are not issued by the Service for listed plant species.
 However, the Service cannot issue a permit for incidental take of listed animal species if a proposed action will jeopardize listed plant species in the project area.
 A Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) must accompany any application for an incidental take permit.
 The purpose of the HCP is to provide measures that will minimize and mitigate impacts to listed species.
 The application for a HCP should include the following information:
 1.	An assessment of impacts likely to result from the proposed taking of one or more listed species.
 2.	Measures that the permit applicant will undertake to monitor, minimize, and mitigate for such impacts; the funding that will be made available to implement such measures; and the procedures to deal with unforeseen or extraordinary circumstances.
 3.	Alternative actions to the taking that the applicant analyzed, and the reasons as to why the applicant did not adopt such alternatives.
 4.	Additional measures that the Service may require as necessary or appropriate.
 2.2 Procedures for Pesticide Incidents Involving Service Trust Resources Resources
 For incidents where a pesticide application may have caused mortality or damage to a Service trust resource, qualified Service personnel (e.g., law enforcement agents, environmental contaminant specialists) should be contacted prior to initial entry into an area involving a pesticide incident.
 Only Service law enforcement agents are authorized to enter private property without landowner permission to investigate a mortality incident related to use of a pesticide.
 All other Service personnel must obtain permission of landowners to enter private property.
 According to Service regulations (Fish and Wildlife Service Manual, 242 FW 6, Hazardous Materials Operations), Service personnel are prohibited from entering sites that (1) involve contamination of personnel by hazardous materials or (2) require personal protection equipment (chemical-resistant clothing, respirators, breathing apparatuses, etc.).
 Service personnel may only enter sites where there are no known atmospheric hazard and no possible involvement with hazardous chemicals through physical contact, splashes, immersion, or unexpected inhalation.
 After a site has been determined to be adequately safe for conducting a response by qualified Service personnel, a determination should be made as to whether dead or injured animals are the result of a pesticide incident or an infectious disease.
 Since some pesticides and wildlife diseases can affect humans, each carcass or injured animal must be approached or processed as a potential health hazard.
 Appropriate equipment (binoculars, chemical-resistant gloves, coveralls, rubber boots, handling tongs, etc.) must be used for investigation of animal die-offs or collection of dead specimens.
 Procedures for conducting a field response to a mortality incident can be found in the Field Manual of Wildlife Diseases:
 General Field Procedures and Diseases of Birds which can be accessed at the internet website of the U.
 S.
 Geological Survey:
 http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/pub_metadata/field_manual /field_ manual.html.
 2.3	Contacts for Pesticide Incidents Involving Service Trust Resources in Region 2 2
 Since a single observed mortality or damaging effect involving a Service trust resource (migratory bird, listed species, or facility) may be a potential violation of a statutory authority, any pesticide-related mortality or incident involving a Service trust resource should be reported.
 Notifications for pesticide incidents in Region 2 should involve the following personnel or agencies:
 1.	Any incident where pesticides have killed or injured migratory birds, listed species, or proposed species in Region 2 should be reported to Service law enforcement:
 2.	Any incident where pesticides may have killed or injured migratory birds, listed species, or proposed species should be reported to the Service regional pesticide coordinator at 512-490-0057.
 Additional contacts for pesticide incidents include state departments of agriculture or wildlife.
 3.	Any incident where a pesticide may have killed or injured wildlife or plants on a Service refuge or fish hatchery should be reported to the refuge manager or hatchery manager.
 4.	Any incident where determination of pesticide-related kills or infectious diseases is necessary for migratory birds, listed species, or proposed species should be coordinated with the 	USGS National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, at 608-270-2460.
 5.	Incidents where pesticides may have killed or injured nontarget wildlife (migratory birds, fish, listed species, etc.) should be reported to the Ecological Incident Information System of the U.
 S.

 2.4 Procedures for Pesticide Applications Involving Habitat of Proposed or Listed Listed
 Species Species
 2.4.1 Control of pests or invasive species species
 In some cases, pesticide control of pests or invasive species may be necessary inside or adjacent to (1) habitat of a proposed or listed species or (2) other areas involving a Service trust resource.
 An invasive species is defined as an alien species (plant or animal) whose introduction either causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.
 Pesticide applications such as mosquito pest control may be required inside or adjacent to habitat of migratory birds or proposed or listed species because of human health concerns.
 Invasive plant or animal species can be a greater threat to migratory birds, proposed or listed species, and/or their habitat than impacts from pesticide use.
 To accomplish recovery of certain listed species, pesticides may be required for temporary elimination of populations of both invasive species and resident listed species (e.g., use of piscicides in aquatic habitat of listed fish species to remove competing or hybridizing species).
 Many invasive plant species can only be controlled by pesticides due to aggressive reproductive strategies, root sprouting, spreading root systems, etc.
 As an example, saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) has rapidly expanded into riparian areas of the western United States and can be a major competitor in habitat of certain listed species such as Pecos sunflower (Helianthus paradoxus).
 Due to high seed production and root sprouting, broad scale aerial applications of herbicides are usually required to control saltcedar over extensive areas such as watershed basins.
 The nearest Service field office, as given in section 2.5 Service Office Contacts below, should be contacted prior to applying pesticide inside or adjacent to habitat of proposed or listed species.
 The Invasive Species Coordinator in the Resource Management Division of the Service Regional Office may be contacted at 505-248-6632 for assistance in control of invasive plants.
 For information on control of invasive or undesirable aquatic species other than plants, the Regional Service Non-indigenous Species Coordinator may be contacted at 505-248-6471.
 General information on invasive species and listed species can be found at the Service internet website:
 http://www.fws.gov.
 2.4.2 Species surveys surveys
 Before pesticides can be applied inside or adjacent to habitat of a proposed or listed species, a determination should be made as to whether the habitat is occupied.
 Occupied habitat of proposed or listed species is defined to be an area where the species is known to occur based on (1) species presence confirmed by a Service-approved survey, (2) visual sightings of the species or its habitat components (nests, roosts, etc.), or (3) the best available scientific knowledge.
 Habitat is considered to be occupied even if the species is absent from the habitat at some point during the annual breeding cycle (e.g., migration).
 To determine occupied habitat of a proposed or listed animal species, a survey usually should be conducted for the species before pesticide application.
 As part of a Federal action involving habitat of a listed plant species, Federal agencies should require a survey to be conducted for the listed plant species before application of herbicide.
 For all other applicators or relevant agencies, a survey for listed plant species is recommended prior to herbicide application within species habitat on non-Federal land.
 Pesticide applicators and relevant agencies should contact the nearest Service field office for information on protocols for conducting listed species surveys.
 Generally, a scientific permit must be obtained from the Service before conducting a survey for a listed animal species.
 Inholdings of nonhabitat areas (e.g., cropland) within habitat of proposed or listed animal species may be excluded in a survey if the species substantially avoids utilizing the nonhabitat areas.
 In some cases, a species survey can be used to flag or otherwise mark individual plants or animal habitat components (nests, roosts, etc.) prior to actual pesticide application.
 The Service may be consulted to determine when a survey is no longer applicable for a particular area and a new survey is necessary.
 Applicators or relevant agencies should also consult with the Service on surveys for pesticide applications in right-of-way corridors that traverse habitat of listed species.
 2.4.3 Requirements for ESA authorizations or permits permits
 When results of a Service-approved survey or other information indicate that a habitat is occupied by a listed species, applicators should coordinate with the nearest Service field office to determine (1) measures to protect the species and (2) any necessary incidental take authorizations or permits as stipulated under section 7 or section 10 of the ESA.
 In addition to incidental take permits of listed animal species, scientific permits may also be issued by the Service under ESA�s section 10.
 These scientific permits allow for incidental take of listed species as part of activities intended to promote species recovery (e.g., use of a pesticide in listed species habitat to reduce competition by an invasive species).
 Service field offices, as given in section 2.5 Service Office Contacts below, can be contacted for information on scientific permits.
 Before incidental take authorizations or permits can be given by the Service, either a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) or an action document by a Federal agency (e.g., a biological assessment) must ordinarily be prepared for pesticide treatments involving habitat of proposed or listed species.
 The HCP or Federal action document should be consistent with any Integrated Pesticide Management (IPM) plan that has been previously developed for a project area.
 Any HCP or Federal action document that involves control of pests or invasive species inside or adjacent to habitat of proposed or listed species should minimize short-term habitat damage from pesticide application while enabling habitat recovery.
 The HCP or Federal action document should address pest control necessary for recovery of species or the habitat, as well as management of sources of re-infestation, such as seed vectors (prevailing winds, flood corridors, etc.).
 When necessary, the HCP or Federal action document should also address re-establishment of native plant species.
 2.4.4 Work plans plans
 As part of a Habitat Conservation Plan or Federal action document involving pesticide treatment that may adversely affect proposed or listed species, the Service recommends that standard operating procedures (SOPs) be written separately into a work plan and approved by the Service prior to application of pesticide.
 For situations involving small areas of treatment and relatively low impacts by selected pesticides, the written work plan may be omitted; however, the nearest Service field office should be consulted.
 At a minimum, the work plan for pesticide treatment should include the following items:
 1.	A description and map of the area to be treated, treated,
 2.	The schedule for applying pesticide in the field, field,
 3.	A survey or detailed habitat analysis for proposed or listed species, species,
 4.	Procedures for applying pesticide, and and
 5.	Any necessary protection measures such as monitoring.
 Work plans should ordinarily require that (1) application of pesticide be closely supervised and (2) applicators using any type of ground equipment must be able to identify proposed or listed species in treated areas when these species are present.
 In areas with varied distributions of proposed or listed species, the work plan may allow only spot applications by handheld equipment in zones that have relatively high impact to proposed or listed species while restricting use of mechanized ground equipment or aerial applications to zones that have relatively low impact.
 When a single pesticide treatment can substantially impact an entire population of a proposed or listed species or its habitat, the Service recommends a staggered sequence of pesticide treatments over different time periods.
 For treatments involving extensive land areas, relatively new populations of invasive species should generally be treated with pesticide prior to treatment of well-established populations.
 Residual pesticide activity in soils or on vegetation within the project area should be considered in setting up the application schedule for the work plan.
 If feasible, applications of pesticides should generally be restricted to periods when (1) proposed or listed migratory species are absent from the habitat or (2) proposed or listed plant species are dormant.
 2.4.5 Pesticide selection selection
 Pesticide active ingredients and any adjuvants (drift retardants, surfactants, etc.), carrier materials, or other types of pesticide additives used inside or adjacent to habitat of proposed or listed species should be fully evaluated for relative risk to these species and elements of their habitat such as plant cover, prey species, pollinators, etc.
 In addition to acute toxicity, other factors associated with pesticides such as chronic toxicity, bioaccumulation, and secondary poisoning potential should also be evaluated.
 The evaluation process for a particular pesticide should include the use of the pesticide, mode of action, and environmental fate.
 Pesticide use is determined by by
 1.	Type of control (insect, broadleaf weed, etc.), etc.),
 2.	Treatment category (pre-emergent herbicides, post-emergent herbicides, etc.), and and
 3.	Formulation (liquid, granular, etc.).
 The mode of action for a pesticide includes includes
 1.	Route or pathway of exposure into an organism (root absorption, inhalation, etc.), etc.),
 2.	Ability to translocate within an organism (e.g., systemic vs.
 nonsystemic), and and
 3.	Behavior as an antimetabolite (respiratory depression, photosynthesis inhibition, reproductive impairment, endocrine system disruption, etc.).
 Environmental fate of pesticides involves persistence, leaching ability, volatilization, transformations (e.g., lethal degradates), bioaccumulation, and other attributes of pesticides after release into the environment.
 Comparisons should be made between alternative pesticides and their individual characteristics for applications inside species habitat, critical habitat, or Pesticide Sensitive Areas.
 Information on pesticides may be found at internet sources such as the EXTOXNET website (http://ace.orst.edu/info/extoxnet).
 Site-specific information for the evaluation process may be obtained from aerial maps, soil surveys, and other sources.
 In general, pesticides with the least acute toxicity and persistence should be selected for use inside or adjacent to habitat of proposed or listed species.
 Selection of pesticide active ingredients that have the least toxicity will tend to decrease buffer zone sizes as recommended in the RPR.
 The volatility of a particular pesticide should be considered in the pesticide selection process if drift from the volatilized pesticide can impact species habitat after treatment has occurred.
 The ability of a pesticide to leach or absorb onto soil or sediment particles should be taken into account for applications that could affect proposed or listed species that are aquatic (plant or animal) or are restricted to aquifers or caves (animal only).
 A pesticide�s potential for inducing chronic toxicity in proposed or listed animal species should be considered if (1) the proposed treatment involves repeated applications, (2) the pesticide in question is persistent in the environment with a relatively long half-life, or (3) a chronic condition may be induced in proposed or listed species by a single application of pesticide.
 Pesticide formulations that are attractive to proposed or listed species should be avoided (e.g., granular formulations applied in areas with grit-eating or seed-eating bird species).
 Pesticides with secondary poisoning potential should also be avoided if proposed or listed species may be affected.
 If possible, only nontoxic carrier materials or adjuvants (drift retardants, surfactants, etc.) should be used for any application.
 Since the toxicity of carrier materials or adjuvants in a pesticide formulation may exceed the toxicity of the active ingredient(s) for a given species, a determination of toxicity should be made for these additives through informational sources such as container labels or MSDSs (material safety data sheets) or by contacting the manufacturer.
 Unless proposed or listed animal species are to be purposely removed by a pesticide treatment, the Service recommends that applied pesticide should be practically non-toxic for the toxicity group of proposed or listed animal species when these species can be directly or indirectly exposed to the pesticide via ingestion, skin absorption, secondary poisoning, etc.
 The Service also recommends that pesticides with slight to very high toxicity be applied in areas with proposed or listed species only if (1) direct or indirect exposure pathways for the species do not exist (e.g., rodenticides used in areas with listed insectivore birds) or (2) the pesticide is applied in formulations with extremely low concentrations that normally cannot impact the species (e.g., fire ant baits).
 Pesticides rated as slightly toxic to very highly toxic may be used when proposed or listed animal species are absent; however, these pesticides should not remain active within the soil or on surfaces of vegetation in species habitat by the time when (1) migratory proposed or listed species have returned to the habitat or (2) proposed or listed species break hibernation or aestivation (summer dormancy).
 For habitat with proposed or listed plant species, the Service recommends that only post-emergent herbicides be used providing that the pesticide is nontoxic to the dicot or monocot classification of resident proposed or listed plant species (e.g., a post-emergent, broadleaf herbicide used in habitat of a listed monocot species).
 However, applicators or relevant agencies should determine whether such applications may indirectly impact proposed or listed plants through factors such as increased competition by non-affected plants, change in soil properties, etc.
 Pre-emergent herbicides or pesticides that remain active within the soil after application should generally not be applied in habitat of proposed or listed plant species by any application method.
 A possible exception is use of a pesticide whose residual soil activity is gone by the time when dormancy of a proposed or listed plant species has been broken.
 2.4.6 Application equipment equipment
 Applicators should avoid physical injury to proposed or listed species or their habitat components (nests, roosts, etc.) in using pesticide application equipment.
 If possible, application equipment should be selected on the basis of reducing hazards to Service trust resources from from
 1.	Spray drift (e.g., using mechanized ground equipment rather than aircraft), aircraft),
 2.	Surface runoff (e.g., using application equipment that can inject pesticide below ground), and and
 3.	Pesticide formulation (e.g., using application equipment with closed system technology to prevent spills of granules, pellets, or treated seed).
 Spray nozzles designed for low nozzle pressures and coarse droplet sizes should generally be used in applications near sensitive areas.
 To reduce spray drift in aerial applications, the width of the spray boom should not exceed 75 percent of the wingspan for fixed-wing aircraft or 90 percent of the rotary blade for helicopters.
 As an alternative to boom sprayers or other similar ground equipment, a spray gun operated under pressure from a pesticide spray tank may be used if the pesticide is applied in liquid streams.
 In areas where invasive species are in close proximity to proposed or listed species, application of pesticide should be made by handheld equipment rather than by mechanized application equipment (ground or aerial).
 A backpack sprayer, wicking tool, paintbrush or other types of hand-operated equipment can be used for pesticide applications such as (1) spot applications involving single plants or plant clusters, (2) basal applications on woody species, or (3) �cut-and-daub� treatments on tree stumps or peeled-back tree bark.
 2.4.7 Pesticide application procedures procedures
 Pesticides should not be applied during temperature inversions or when rainfall is likely to occur within 48 hours after treatment.
 To avoid temperature inversions, wind speeds should be at least 3 miles per hour; however, wind speeds should not exceed 10 miles per hour during pesticide application.
 Wind direction and speed should be monitored during any pesticide application.
 Meteorological equipment such as wind socks, anemometers, or smoke devices may be used to assess wind conditions or detect temperature inversions.
 If a pesticide is applied during a wind greater than 10 miles per hour, pesticide users should increase buffer zones for both ground and aerial applications to prevent spray drift or residue in surface runoff from entering areas that require protection.
 Best management practices for pesticide applications should be followed to protect species and habitat.
 Aerial flight paths made during pesticide application should be parallel to sensitive areas and buffer zones rather than flying directly over them.
 Pesticides should not be mixed, stored, or handled near sensitive areas.
 Excess pesticide and empty pesticide containers should not be allowed to remain near species habitat or waterbodies and should be discarded at authorized landfills or other appropriate sites.
 Application equipment should be well-maintained and checked periodically for leaks, worn parts, and calibration.
 Nontoxic drift retardants should be used in pesticide applications of a liquid formulation to limit pesticide spray drift into sensitive areas.
 Prior to application, pesticide-sensitive dye cards or other types of monitoring devices should be used to calibrate application equipment.
 Dye cards or other types of monitoring devices may also be placed at the outlying edge of areas requiring protection to determine the effectiveness of spray drift reduction during pesticide application.
 2.4.8 Monitoring Monitoring
 Federal agencies should either conduct monitoring or otherwise require monitoring in any action that the Federal agency authorizes, funds, or carries out under section 7 of the ESA with respect to pesticide applications either inside or adjacent to habitat of proposed or listed species or critical habitat.
 For all other applicators or relevant agencies, monitoring is recommended during pesticide application inside or adjacent to species habitat or critical habitat.
 In addition to weather monitoring during pesticide application, monitoring may be necessary for pesticide applications involving Pesticide Sensitive Areas or species habitat near managed areas (golf courses, municipal parks, etc.).
 Measures for monitoring should be described in the work plan.
 State agricultural departments, county extension services, and other appropriate agencies (e.g., land grant universities) may be consulted on procedures and techniques to implement pesticide monitoring.
 Pre-application monitoring and/or post-application monitoring may be necessary for pesticide applications that can affect proposed or listed species or critical habitat.
 Pre-application monitoring may be used to determine prerequisites for pesticide application.
 The population dynamics and life stages of pest or invasive species may have to be monitored by sampling (frequency measurements, trapping, etc.) prior to pesticide application.
 This information can be used for determination of threshold levels of pest or invasive species that will require control by pesticides.
 In post-application monitoring, applicators or relevant agencies may need to monitor areas with proposed or listed species or critical habitat for (1) ambient pesticide concentrations after application or (2) possible long-term trends in adverse effects for species or habitat.
 The monitoring portion of the work plan should address sampling locations, sample matrices (soil, sediment, tissue, etc.), numbers of samples, and the schedule for sampling.
 Monitoring equipment should be placed in areas where pesticides can be transported into species habitat by spray drift or surface runoff.
 Water quality in habitat of aquatic listed species should be monitored continuously when this habitat is in close proximity to managed areas that require repeated applications of pesticide (golf courses, municipal parks, etc.).
 To determine pesticide concentrations, samples should be collected during normal flow periods and during storm events large enough to produce surface runoff.
 If only a single storm runoff sample can be taken, sampling should occur near the beginning of the runoff event to capture the first pulse of runoff-borne pesticides.
 2.5 Service Office Contacts Contacts
 For pesticide applications involving Service trust resources inside individual states of Region 2, applicators or agencies can contact Service field offices:
 For pest control programs involving Service trust resources in more than one state of Region 2, applicators or agencies should contact the Service Regional Office:
 3.0 RPR PROTECTION MEASURES MEASURES
 3.1	Recommended Measures, Pesticide Ecotoxicity Classes, and Species Species
 Information Information
 Table 1 of this document specifies recommended protection measures for Service trust resources of facilities, migratory birds, and proposed or listed species.
 The table also specifies recommended protection measures for (1) critical habitat when proposed or designated, and (2) pollinators of a proposed or listed plant species.
 Protection measures for certain species are not specified in Table 1 if the species is unaffected by pesticides due to to
 1.	Relatively large body weight (e.g., Sonoran pronghorn), pronghorn),
 2.	Location (e.g., brown pelicans nesting on coastal bay islands), or or
 3.	Seasonality (e.g., piping plovers wintering in Texas).
 Protection measures are based in this document on a screening-level hazard assessment for pesticide ecotoxicity as determined in Table 2.
 In the table, pesticides are rated by a classification system that categorizes the level or type of protection to be given for a particular pesticide with respect to ecotoxicity.
 Four ecotox classes for animals and three ecotox classes for plants are used in the classification system to rank active ingredients or formulations of pesticides.
 For animal species, the four ecotox classes cover ranges of pesticide toxicity:
 Class 0		This class includes pesticides that are practically nontoxic to a specific group of animal species that have similar toxicological responses (e.g., fungicidal toxicity for large				mammal species).
 Class 0 pesticides ordinarily do not require protection measures for				animal species.
 Class 1		This class includes pesticides that are slightly to moderately toxic to a specific group 					of animal species that have similar toxicological responses (e.g., malathion toxicity 						for small mammal species).
 Buffer zones and other protection measures for Class 1 						pesticides are minimal for animal species.
 Class 2		This class includes pesticides that are highly toxic to a specific group of animal 							species that have similar toxicological responses (e.g., diazinon toxicity for warm 						water fish species).
 Buffer zones and other protection measures for Class 2 pesticides 					are relatively substantial for animal species.
 Class 3		This class includes pesticides that are very highly toxic to a specific group of animal 						species that have similar toxicological responses (e.g., carbofuran toxicity for small avian 				species).
 Buffer zones and other protection measures for Class 3 pesticides can be highly 				stringent for animal species depending on the sensitivity of a species or its habitat.
 Toxicity endpoints for the four pesticide ecotoxicity classes for animals are defined at the back of this document (see Appendix A).
 Although plant species do not have ranges of pesticide toxicity similar to animal species, pesticides can be rated by ecotox class according to their herbicidal toxicity.
 Pesticide ecotox classes for plants in Table 2 are:
 Class D		This class includes pesticides that have specific toxicity for dicot plants such as legumes,				mustards, etc.
 Buffer zones and other protection measures for Class D herbicides				depend on the dicot classification of individual proposed or listed plant species and the				canopy structure of their habitat.
 Class M		This class includes pesticides that have specific toxicity for monocot plants such as 						grasses, sedges, orchids, etc.
 Buffer zones and other protection measures for Class M 					herbicides depend on the monocot classification of individual proposed or listed plant 					species and the canopy structure of their habitat.
 Class NS		This class includes pesticides that have nonspecific toxicity for any plant species.
 Buffer				zones and other protection measures for Class NS herbicides do not depend on the dicot 				or monocot classification of individual proposed or listed plant species but can depend on 				the canopy structure of their habitat.
 When pesticide toxicity data are lacking for a particular species toxicity group, the rating is modeled after the closest taxonomic group:
 1.	Large Mammal and Predatory Mammal from Small Mammal; Mammal;
 2.	Large Avian from Waterfowl Avian; Avian;
 3.	Predatory Avian, Small Avian, and Reptile from Gallinaceous Avian; and and
 4.	Fresh Water Mollusk from Aquatic Arthropod.
 The toxicity groups of Aquatic Amphibian and Terrestrial Amphibian (e.g., toads) are modeled from the highest rating of either Cold Water Fish or Warm Water Fish when amphibian toxicity data are unavailable.
 Pesticides are rated as Class 3 in the Terrestrial Arthropod toxicity group if a particular active ingredient is used as an insecticide; otherwise, the Terrestrial Arthropod toxicity group is modeled from the higher rating of either the Aquatic Arthropod or Bee toxicity groups.
 Blank cells in the table indicate insufficient information to (1) make a determination of a pesticide�s ecotoxicity rating or (2) justify modeling from an appropriate species toxicity group.
 Pesticide active ingredients listed in Table 2 may have more than one line entry for individual formulations if these formulations have different ecotox class ratings for individual species toxicity groups (e.g., aquatic formulations of glyphosate vs.
 nonaquatic formulations).
 Ecotox class ratings in Table 2 for individual pesticides may have letter subscripts to describe various types of pesticide application or toxicity.
 For example, burrow fumigants are indicated by the subscript �b� whereas pesticides that have a potential for secondary poisoning are indicated by the subscript �sp� (e.g., a rodenticide bait rated as Class 2sp that can kill a predatory animal after the predator has consumed bait-poisoned rodents).
 Pesticides rated for eye or skin irritancy are respectively designated in the table by �e� and �s� subscripts.
 An herbicide rated as Class NSf indicates that individual formulations of the herbicide may have either dicot-specific or monocot-specific toxicity as determined by the application rate (e.g., triazine herbicides).
 In general, the ecotox ratings in the table reflect the highest level of necessary protection according to potential pesticide hazards (acute oral toxicity, subacute dietary toxicity, eye irritancy, etc.).
 The final ecotox class rating for an active ingredient or formulation may reflect pesticide hazards for species such as eye or skin irritancy rather than acute lethal toxicity (e.g., an herbicide that is practically non-toxic for terrestrial animal species on the basis of oral toxicity but is rated as Class 2e for corrosive eye irritancy).
 Toxicity groups of mammals, birds, reptiles, and terrestrial amphibians can be rated for eye irritancy from pesticide active ingredients, but only mammalian toxicity groups (L-MA, P-MA, and S-MA) are rated for skin irritancy.
 Pesticide ratings in the table may also be adjusted for factors such as sublethal effects (e.g., a pyrethroid pesticide rated for endocrine system disruption rather than for actual toxicity in field applications) or lethal byproducts (e.g., moderately toxic acephate transformed into highly toxic methamdiphos).
 3.2 Buffer Zones Zones
 Pesticide buffer zones are recommended in the RPR principally for protection of species and habitat from (1) downwind spray drift during pesticide application and (2) pesticide residues in surface runoff.
 A buffer zone is considered to be the distance between the boundary of the area requiring protection and the closest point of the last spot application or application swath.
 Border areas (roadways, fence lines, canal dikes, etc.) may be used as part of a buffer zone for any type of application if the border area itself does not involve species habitat or a sensitive area.
 In addition to providing protection against spray drift or residues in surface runoff, buffer zones can also reflect minimal distances necessary to address various attributes of species with respect to to
 1.	Mobility (e.g., foraging areas of Attwater�s greater prairie-chicken), prairie-chicken),
 2.	Sensitivity to disturbance (e.g., nesting birds-of-prey), birds-of-prey),
 3.	Exposure to secondary poisoning (e.g., carrion-eating mammals), and and
 4.	Dietary habits (e.g., seed-eating or grit-eating birds).
 The size of the buffer zone is relative to the type of application (i.e., spot, mechanized ground, or aerial) and depositional pattern of the formulation (liquid, granular, etc.) used during pesticide treatment.
 For purposes of defining pesticide formulations with respect to depositional patterns, solid-type formulations are defined in this document as including baits, granules, pellets, and treated seed formulations but do not include dust formulations.
 Liquid formulations of pesticides are defined as including all formulations of emulsifiable concentrates, flowables, invert emulsions, micro-encapsulated sprays, soluble powders, water-soluble packets, wettable powders, or any other type of liquid-based formulation except for ULV formulations.
 ULV (ultra low volume) formulations are liquid concentrates that are applied at a rate of 1/2 gallon or less per acre.
 Applications of ULV formulations are highly prone to spray drift due to very small droplet sizes (i.e., generally less than 141 �m diam.).
 Dust formulations also can have very small particle sizes (as little as 5 �m diam.) and are considered to have drift characteristics similar to ULV formulations.
 3.2.1 Buffer zone approximations approximations
 Various buffer zone sizes and ecotox class ratings are used in the RPR to attain adequate reduction of residues in spray drift and/or surface runoff with respect to pesticide toxicity.
 In some cases, alternative applications or formulations may be provided in the RPR to reduce a particular buffer zone (e.g., a relatively small buffer zone used in conjunction with a belowground application of a solid formulation to protect seed-eating bird species).
 Due to low probability of toxicity and exposure, bait formulations specific for insects (particularly fire ant baits) are generally not given buffer zones except for species habitat where proposed or listed species may be affected (e.g., invertebrate species).
 For animal species, minimal buffer zones for Class 1 pesticides are based on estimates of the distance required for attaining (1) approximately 98-99 percent reduction of deposited active ingredient or (2) minimal effects during ground or aerial application.
 Minimal buffer zones recommended in this document for application of Class 1 pesticides by mechanized ground equipment or aircraft are are
 1.	Thirty feet for mechanized ground applications of liquid formulations, formulations,
 2.	Eighty feet for mechanized ground applications of ULV (ultra low volume) formulations, formulations,
 3.	One hundred fifty feet for low (< 10 feet) aerial applications of liquid formulations, formulations,
 4.	Five hundred feet for low aerial applications of ULV or dust formulations, formulations,
 5.	One-eighth mile for high (> 10 feet) aerial applications of liquid formulations, and and
 6.	One-fourth mile for high aerial applications of ULV or dust formulations.
 For proposed or listed species, additional safety factors are provided for Class 2 and Class 3 pesticides by respectively doubling and tripling buffer zones required of Class 1 pesticides.
 Class 2 and Class 3 pesticides may have the same buffer zone when the habitat of a proposed or listed species is less vulnerable to pesticide applications (e.g., aquatic species in large rivers).
 Otherwise, buffer zones for Class 3 pesticides are three times the minimal buffer zones of Class 1 pesticides when the Class 3 pesticides are applied in proximity to (1) edge habitat of sensitive species (e.g., bird species nesting along the edge of cropland) or (2) species habitat with a limited range (e.g., fish species restricted to a small spring system).
 Except for small aquatic habitat and other types of relatively vulnerable habitat, species serving as food sources for proposed or listed species are not given additional safety factors and have the same buffer zones designated for Class 1 pesticides when necessary.
 Buffer zones for proposed or listed plant species are relative to the type of plant canopy associated with the habitat.
 Minimal buffer zones (i.e., buffer zones used for Class 1 pesticides) are used for proposed or listed plant species in plant communities with closed or dense canopies (e.g., forest or thick woodland).
 Proposed or listed plant species in plant communities with open to semi-open canopies (e.g., grassland or brushland) that are susceptible to spray drift are given minimal buffer zones plus an additional safety factor (i.e., buffer zones used for Class 2 pesticides).
 Buffer zones for plant pollinators (bees and/or terrestrial arthropods) are based on a pollinator�s ability (as determined by size) to range from the area of a listed plant species.
 A buffer zone of 1/2 mile at the edge of sites occupied by listed plant species is recommended for small pollinators such as halictid (metallic) bees whereas a 2-mile buffer zone is recommended for relatively large pollinators such as bumble bees or hawkmoths.
 Alternative buffer zones for pollinators are recommended according to seasonality of flowering of listed plant species.
 For aquatic habitats with proposed or listed species, buffer zones are based on the potential for adverse pesticide concentrations relative to water volume.
 Small water bodies are considered to include include
 1.	Ponds, lakes, and reservoirs less than 100 surface acres; acres;
 2.	Spring runs, streams, and rivers less than 100 cfs (cubic feet per second, mean monthly discharge); or or
 3.	Shallows of relatively large waterbodies.
 Large waterbodies include either either
 1.	Lakes or reservoirs of 100 to 1000 surface acres; or or
 2.	Spring runs, streams, and rivers of 100 to 1000 cfs (mean monthly discharge).
 Because of a relatively low potential for lethal or sublethal pesticide concentrations, buffer zones for larger waterbodies (i.e., coastal bays, large lakes, or reservoirs greater than 1000 surface acres; rivers greater than 1000 cfs) are not given in the RPR.
 Calculated distances for buffer zones are given in Appendix B of this document.
 Due to lack of spray drift and relatively low environmental concentrations, buffer zones for spot applications are generally derived in 10-foot increments.
 Buffer zones between 100 feet and 500 feet for mechanized ground and aerial applications are rounded to the nearest 50 feet.
 Beyond 500 feet, buffer zones are rounded to the nearest 1/8 mile, 1/4 mile, or 1/2 mile, where appropriate.
 The buffer zones are relative to the height of nozzles or spreaders during pesticide application.
 Buffer zones for mechanized ground applications are based on a nozzle or spreader height of no more than four feet above the plant canopy or ground surface.
 The buffer zones for aerial applications are specified according to low or high applications.
 Low aerial applications are 10 feet or less above the plant canopy or bare ground surface and are used mostly in cropland.
 High aerial applications are more than 10 feet above the plant canopy or bare ground surface and are generally used for rangeland or forest.
 In addition to the buffer distances necessary for attaining adequate deposition of pesticide spray and reduction of pesticide toxicity, buffer zones in this document may include setbacks (untreated areas) to allow for species use of edge habitat or habitat susceptibility (e.g., small waterbodies).
 A setback distance of 30 or 60 feet may be used for terrestrial species when these species can travel relatively short distances from species habitat into areas of pesticide treatment.
 To protect aquatic species or aquatic habitat, setback distances of 50 and 300 feet are used, respectively, for relatively large waterbodies and small waterbodies to allow adequate filtration by vegetative filter strips or other types of filtering.
 Other examples of setbacks include pygmy-owl sites, red-cockaded woodpecker clusters, and protected activity centers of the Mexican spotted owl.
 Such areas should generally remain untreated to preserve habitat characteristics essential for survival of local populations or individuals of proposed or listed species.
 3.2.2 Uses and limitations of buffer zones zones
 Three broadly-defined geographic zones are considered in the RPR with respect to pesticide applications and protection measures such as pesticide buffer zones.
 The first geographic zone is the area involving the habitat of a species or a facility (refuge, fish hatchery, preserve, etc.).
 Potential protection measures for applications inside species habitat or a facility include pesticide buffer zones, species surveys, and pesticide use restrictions.
 The second geographic zone is the area that interfaces between (1) species habitat or a facility and (2) nonhabitat areas such as cropland.
 Pesticide buffer zones are the principal protection measures defined for this geographic zone, and the size of the geographic zone itself is relative to individual buffer zones.
 The third geographic zone comprises areas outside the effective range of buffer zones.
 Pesticide applications in the outlying zone can still impact species habitat or a facility by movement of pesticide residues into surface runoff or other transport mechanisms (e.g., groundwater flow).
 Protection measures such as pesticide use restrictions may be necessary in this zone to prevent residues from adversely affecting species or the facility.
 Buffer zones provided in the RPR can generally prevent or reduce the likelihood of killing or injuring species associated with Service trust resources.
 In particular, a buffer zone provides greater protection against �take� for proposed or listed animal species including take from from
 1.	Sublethal effects (abnormal behavioral changes, endocrine system disruption, etc.), etc.),
 2.	Indirect effects (e.g., loss of prey species), or or
 3.	Bioaccumulation of pesticide antimetabolites through food chains or the water environment.
 Buildup of pesticide residues in edge habitat of terrestrial species from repeated field applications can also be reduced by using prescribed buffer zones thereby decreasing the potential for chronic toxicity (i.e., exposure to a toxicant for relatively long periods of time during the life cycle or stage of a species).
 Chronic toxicities for proposed or listed species in aquatic habitat may be reduced by using buffer zones; however, chronic conditions of toxicity in these habitats are potentially influenced by mass transport of pesticide residues (e.g., sediment-borne residues) from portions of the watershed that lie beyond the habitat itself.
 In some situations, buffer zones alone are not always adequate to address complexities involved with pesticide applications (see section 3.3 Pesticide Sensitive Areas for Listed Species below).
 Also, buffer zones may not always reflect necessary levels of protection for a given pesticide due to approximations that are made in deriving buffer zone sizes.
 Relatively limited numbers of surrogate test species and pesticide formulations (ordinarily a technical formulation with at least 90 percent active ingredient) are used to determine ecotox ratings.
 Therefore, the ratings found in Table 2 may only represent a general case in regard to the toxicity of pesticide active ingredients and their various formulations.
 Another limitation is that ecotox ratings do not account for the environmental fate of individual pesticides that can reduce exposure for species (e.g., high volatilization).
 Buffer zone sizes may, therefore, be underestimated or overestimated in terms of pesticide toxicity and exposure for certain species; however, safety factors associated with buffer zones as given by the RPR should help to protect against underestimation of an appropriate buffer zone size.
 3.3 Pesticide Sensitive Areas for Listed Species Species
 Pesticide Sensitive Areas have been designated in the RPR to simplify or adequately address complex situations associated with pesticide applications that potentially affect proposed or listed species and critical habitat.
 Pesticide Sensitive Areas designated in the RPR are shown in the following list.
 Pesticide Sensitive Areas are used in the RPR to reconcile different requirements for buffer zones and other protection measures caused by by
 1.	Proposed or listed species entering areas involving pesticide applications (e.g., Attwater�s greater prairie-chicken entering cropland adjacent to its habitat), or or
 2.	Co-location of more than one species and/or areas of critical habitat (e.g., co-location of five listed aquatic species with four areas of overlapping critical habitat in the San Marcos River of central Texas).
 Pesticide Sensitive Areas are also used to define watersheds where pesticide monitoring and restrictions on pesticide use should possibly be implemented.
 In some Pesticide Sensitive Areas, an integrated pest management (IPM) plan may be used to protect listed species.
 IPM strategies include include
 1.	Cultural controls (e.g., crop rotation), rotation),
 2.	Biological controls (e.g., insect predators), predators),
 3.	Mechanical controls (e.g., pest barriers), barriers),
 4.	Chemical controls (e.g., pesticides), and and
 5.	Selection for host resistance.
 State agricultural departments, county extension services, and other appropriate agencies such as the EPA should be consulted to coordinate or implement any necessary use restrictions and/or pesticide monitoring inside a Pesticide Sensitive Area.
 4.0 RPR PROCEDURE PROCEDURE
 4.1	 Use of the RPR RPR
 This document provides recommendations for pesticide applications in Region 2 that involve Service trust resources of (1) national wildlife refuges and fish hatcheries, (2) migratory birds, and (3) Federally-listed species.
 The RPR specifically provides pesticide protection measures that can be used to protect listed species, species proposed for listing, and critical habitat in Region 2.
 Pesticide protection measures listed in the RPR may be used in ESA section 7 consultations or section 10 permit processes.
 However, the RPR itself cannot be used in lieu of section 7 consultations or section 10 permits as required under the ESA.
 In addition to ESA pesticide consultations, the RPR may be used in conjunction with development of protection measures for various pesticide programs such as the Service�s Pesticide Use Program (PUP) for refuges or hatcheries.
 Recommendations in the RPR do not constitute rules, regulations, requirements, or project evaluation criteria of the Service.
 The recommendations also do not create or establish any legal obligations, binding effects, minimum standards, or criteria to be adopted by the private sector or by government agencies at the Federal, state, or local level.
 Service trust resources are protected from pesticide applications under various statutory authorities and regulations (ESA, FIFRA, etc.).
 Pesticide use restrictions as stated on FIFRA pesticide labels (i.e., labels for section 3 registrations, section 18 emergency exemptions, or section 24(c) state-specific registrations) must be implemented by all pesticide applicators.
 However, protection measures in the RPR may be used in ESA consultations if the RPR protection measures are more protective than pesticide use restrictions prescribed by FIFRA-related pesticide labels.
 Protection measures for proposed or listed species as provided below may be used by Service personnel as baseline information in preparing a Biological Opinion (BO) or Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP).
 The protection measures can be used as appropriate for developing BO components such as reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs), reasonable and prudent measures (RPMs), and conservation measures.
 However, potential take of listed animal species or injury to listed plants should not be inferred when recommended protection measures in the RPR are not used.
 Actual determination of take or listed plant injury can only be made by the Service after pesticide application has occurred.
 Protection measures recommended in the RPR are based on a screening-level hazard assessment for various pesticide ecotoxicities as determined in Table 2; therefore, protection measures in the RPR may be further modified with additional information on a case by case basis.
 As part of a Federal agency action or HCP permit process under the ESA, agencies or applicators can submit alternative protection measures (including ecotox class ratings) for specific pesticides to the nearest Service field office.
 These alternative protection measures should be based on ecological risk assessments, field trials, or peer-reviewed publications.
 County extension services, state agricultural departments, and other agencies may be consulted for alternative protection measures.
 Pesticide applications involving Service trust resources should be based on the assumption that risk to these resources from pesticides can never be completely evaluated or necessarily eliminated.
 In particular, the use of surrogate animal species for estimating pesticide toxicities may not always accurately predict all potential outcomes with respect to exposure of a listed species to specific pesticides.
 Variability in pesticide operations (methods, equipment, etc.) also contributes to risk factors involved with pesticide applications.
 Although protection measures in the RPR should provide adequate protection under most circumstances, prudent care should be taken in using this document for individual pesticide applications.
 During any pesticide application, it is the responsibility of the applicator or action agency to ensure that ESA provisions are not violated such as unauthorized take of listed animal species, killing or damaging endangered plant species on Federal lands, etc.
 4.2	 Determination of Protection Measures Measures
 To develop pesticide protection measures from the RPR, the following process should be applied:
 1.	Find appropriate protection measures and species toxicity groups from Table 1.
 Specific 	 protection measures for Service facilities, migratory birds, and proposed or listed species found below in section 4.2.2.
 2.	Cross-reference individual protection measure numbers from Table 1 to corresponding protection measures found in List of recommended protection measures for Service trust resources in Region 2 in section 4.3.
 3.	Determine relevant parts from each protection measure that pertain to the proposed pesticide application or action.
 When required by a particular protection measure, determine:
 a.	Ecotox class ratings for pesticides from Table 2.
 Ecotoxicity ratings for pesticide active ingredients and various formulations in section 4.4.1.
 b.	Biological factors (habitat/range, seasonality, plant classification, plant flowering periods, and pollinators) for proposed or listed species from Table 3.
 Biological information for proposed or listed species in Region 2 in section 4.4.2.
 After determining general protection measures from the RPR process as shown above, individual protection measures may be developed for specific pesticide applications in a given area.
 Alternative buffer zones suggested by individual protection measures may be used as appropriate according to the type of application or formulation being used.
 Supplementary sources of information (e.g., habitat maps, soil surveys, and evaluations such as risk assessments) should be used to further refine final protection measures for pesticide applications.
 Protection measures for pesticide applications involving Service facilities should be used on a default basis if protection measures derived for proposed or listed species are less stringent.
 When two or more sets of protection measures are applicable for a particular pesticide formulation or application, the more restrictive protection measures are recommended.
 This may occur when (1) more than one listed species is involved in a given area (e.g., listed birds-of-prey nesting in an area that has a listed plant species) or (2) a pesticide has more than one active ingredient with different toxicities for individual toxicity groups (e.g., an herbicide that has 2, 4-D combined with bromacil).
 4.2.1 Approximation of ecotox class ratings ratings
 For determination of buffer zones or other levels of protection, pesticides that have the same ecotox class ratings are given the same level of protection regardless of the subscript descriptor (e.g., Class 2b, Class 2e, or Class 2sp pesticides should all treated as Class 2 pesticides with respect to buffer zones).
 Active ingredients or formulations in Table 2 that have a Class 0 rating for a given toxicity group do not ordinarily require protection measures for that particular toxicity group unless otherwise indicated by the pesticide label or other informational sources.
 Since blank cells in Table 2 generally reflect cases where pesticide toxicity testing has not been performed (e.g., household pesticides untested for outdoor uses), additional information should be obtained on active ingredients or formulations of pesticides that have blank cells with respect to individual species prior to use of these particular pesticides in proximity to Service trust resources.
 Determination of toxicity for active ingredients or formulations can generally be made by (1) consulting pesticide informational sources (e.g., pesticide container labels) or (2) contacting the pesticide manufacturer to obtain a material safety data sheet (MSDS).
 In addition to the ecotox ratings given in Table 2 for individual active ingredients, the toxicity ratings scales in Appendix A may be used to classify pesticide formulations that have (1) more than one active ingredient and/or (2) potentially toxic adjuvants or carriers.
 The following process should be used in approximating ecotox class ratings from Appendix A:
 	1.		When toxicity data for a pesticide are available from the manufacturer or other sources for 				toxicity groups tested under FIFRA regulations (i.e., Small Mammal, Gallinaceous Avian, 				Waterfowl Avian, Cold Water Fish, Warm Water Fish, and Aquatic Arthropod), the 						pesticide should be rated by ecotox class according to the ratings scale in Appendix A for 				individual species toxicity groups that potentially will be affected during application of the 				pesticide.
 	2.		For toxicity groups other than those tested under FIFRA, the following taxonomic groups may be modeled accordingly:
 a.
 Large Mammal and Predatory Mammal from the ecotox ratings for Small Mammal.
 b.
 Large Avian from the ecotox ratings for Waterfowl Avian.
 c.
 Predatory Avian, Small Avian, and Reptile from the ecotox ratings for Gallinaceous Avian.
 d.
 Aquatic Amphibian or Terrestrial Amphibian from the highest rating of either Cold Water Fish or Warm Water Fish.
 e.
 For the Terrestrial Arthropod toxicity group, pesticides should be rated as Class 3 if a particular active ingredient is used as an insecticide; otherwise, the Terrestrial Arthropod toxicity group should be modeled from the higher rating of either the Aquatic Arthropod or Bee toxicity groups.
 					f.
 Bee toxicity group from the ecotox ratings for Aquatic Arthropod.
 g.
 Fresh Water Mollusk from the ecotox ratings for Aquatic Arthropod.
 Pesticides with multiple active ingredients and/or toxic agents should be assigned an overall class rating to match the highest level of toxicity indicated by ratings in Appendix A, Table 2, or other sources.
 For example, a nontoxic active ingredient combined in a formulation together with a highly toxic active ingredient should have an ecotox rating of Class 2.
 4.2.2 Specific protection measures measures
 Recommended protection measures for pesticide applications involving Service trust resources in Region 2 are indicated by specific numbers in Table 1, which can be used to reference respective protection measures listed below the table in the sections for Service facilities, migratory birds, and proposed or listed species.

 4.3	List of Recommended Protection Measures for Service Trust Resources in 				Region 	2 	2
 4.3.1 Service facilities facilities
 1.	To protect Service refuges or fish hatcheries, the Service recommends � �
 	a.	Applicators should contact the facility before (1) applying pesticides near facility boundaries with mechanized ground or aerial equipment or (2) implementing a pest control program in the vicinity of the facility.
 Pesticides with the least toxicity and persistence in both soil and water should be used adjacent to a facility=s boundary.
 Pesticide should not be used in or adjacent to wetlands or waterbodies such as canals, ditches, sloughs, etc., that drain into these facilities.
 Aerial pesticide applications should be made in swaths parallel to the facility and its aerial buffer zone.
 If flight over a facility is necessary, applicators should maintain a minimal altitude of 2,000 feet and make sure that shutoff of pesticide sprayers or spreaders has occurred.
 	b.	Applicators should use at least a 1-mile buffer zone at a facility=s boundary when applying the following avian toxicants/deterrents or any other avian toxicant/deterrent.
 aminopyridine (e.g., Avitrol7) Avitrol7)
 chloro-p-toludine hydrochloride (e.g., CPTH, DRC-1339, Starlicide7) Starlicide7)
 fenthion (e.g., Rid-A-Bird7) Rid-A-Bird7)
 polybutene adhesive (e.g., Tanglefoot Bird Repellent7) Repellent7)
 	c.	Applicators should use at least a 3-mile buffer zone from a facility�s boundary when applying the following predator/rodent control agents or any pesticide that can cause secondary poisoning (Class 1sp or Class 2sp) in the Predatory Mammal toxicity group.
 Alternative Buffer Zones:
 *	Chlorophacinone or diphacinone may be applied below ground for control of rodents inside the 3-mile buffer zone if (1) the pesticide is applied on bait sticks inside heavily used burrows of the rodent colony and (2) all tunnel entrances of the colony are covered up.
 H	Animal carcasses with famphur-treated hides should be removed, buried, or otherwise covered inside the 3-mile buffer zone.
 	d.	Applicators should use the following protection measures to protect Service refuges or fish hatcheries for applying pesticides except for the pesticides previously indicated above (i.e., avian toxicants/deterrents, predator/rodent control agents, or pesticides that can cause secondary poisoning):
 	�	The following buffer zones should be implemented at the facility=s boundary for (1) any herbicide that rates as either Class 0 or Class 1 for all animal toxicity groups and (2) any non-herbicidal pesticide (except for avian toxicants/deterrents, predator/rodent control agents, or secondary poisoning agents) that rates no higher than Class 1 in any animal toxicity group.
 Alternative Buffer Zones:
 *	A buffer zone is unnecessary for these formulations if the pesticide is placed into the soil below a 12-inch depth.
 H	These applications and formulations can have a buffer zone of 30 feet from the facility=s boundary if the following three conditions are met:
 (1) a strong, steady wind of at least 3 miles per hour is blowing directly away from the area during the time of application, (2) pesticide residues in surface runoff cannot drain into the area after a precipitation event, and (3) proposed or listed species or their habitat components (nests, roosting sites, etc.) have not been sighted or documented in the area.
 � 	These applications and formulations can have a buffer zone of 30 feet at the facility=s boundary if the pesticide is applied by a sprayer with low pressure nozzles that deliver a spray ranging from coarse to very coarse in droplet size.
 Notes:
 1	A buffer zone is the distance between the boundary of the area requiring protection and the closest point of the last spot application or application swath.
 Border areas (roadways, fence lines, canal dikes, etc.) may be used as part of a buffer zone if the border area itself does not involve species habitat or a sensitive area.
 Standard weather conditions for pesticide application (i.e., no temperature inversions, wind speeds between 3 to 10 miles per hour, and no rainfall for 48 hours) should be followed when implementing recommended buffer zones.
 2	Spot applications include pesticide applications by (1) hand-operated equipment or (2) a spray gun that discharges pesticide in liquid streams from a spray tank.
 3	Low and high aerial applications (respectively, aerial applications either less than 10 feet or greater than 10 feet) are relative to the height of the nozzles or spreaders above (1) the canopy of the field crop or native plant community or (2) a bare ground surface.
 In grassland or semi-open plant communities (shrubland, woodland, etc.) with more than 40 percent grass cover, the top of the grass canopy should be used to determine whether an aerial application is low or high.
 For forested lands or dense shrubland with less than 40 percent grass cover, the tops of trees or shrubs should be used in determining whether applications are low or high.
 4	Solid formulations include baits, granules, pellets, and treated seed but do not include dusts.
 5	Liquid formulations include any type of liquid-based formulation other than ULV formulations.
 6	ULV (ultra low volume) refers to liquid formulations applied at a rate of 1/2 gallon or less per acre.

 3.	To protect burrowing owls, the Service recommends � �
 	a.	The following burrow fumigants or any other burrow fumigant should not be used in nest areas 	of burrowing owls.
 4.	To protect falcons, kites, ospreys, owls (other than burrowing owls), and small hawks (Cooper�s hawk, sharp-shinned hawk, Swainson�s hawk, etc.), the Service recommends � �
 	a.	Pesticides that rate as Class 0 or Class 1 in the Predatory Avian toxicity group should not be applied by any method within 300 feet of active nests of these birds-of-prey until juveniles have left the nest.
 The 300-foot buffer zone is unnecessary for spot or mechanized ground applications in existing rights-of-way adjacent to nests of these birds-of-prey if pesticide toxicity does not exceed Class 1 in the Predatory Avian toxicity group.

 4.3.3 Proposed or listed species species
 12.	To protect species with proposed or designated critical habitat, the Service recommends � �
 	Pesticide use within critical habitat should be kept to a minimum and restricted to areas that do not serve as habitat for proposed or listed species.
 For locations of critical habitat, pesticide users can (a) check 50 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) � 17.95-17.96 which can be found at http://www.gpo.gov or (b) contact the nearest Service field office.
 Federal agencies proposing to authorize, fund, or carry out pesticide applications that can adversely modify critical habitat (brush control, removal of prey species, etc.) must consult with the Service.
 The county extension service, state agricultural department, or nearest Service field office should be consulted for information on alternative protection measures for pesticide use inside or adjacent to critical habitat when protection measures as specified in the RPR cannot be implemented.
 13.	To protect species on refuges, preserves, or public lands that are not part of the Service refuge system, the Service recommends � �
 	Applicators or relevant agencies using pesticides in refuges, preserves, or public lands should identify areas where proposed or listed species and critical habitat may be affected by pesticide applications.
 If a proposed or listed species or critical habitat is present, the nearest Service field office should be consulted prior to pesticide application for information on appropriate protection measures and any necessary incidental take permit or authorization.
 Federal land managers must consult with the Service before application of pesticide on Federal lands that may adversely affect proposed or listed species or adversely modify critical habitat.
 14.	To protect species inside or adjacent to rights-of-way, the Service recommends � �
 	Applicators or relevant agencies using pesticides in right-of-way corridors should identify areas where proposed or listed species and critical habitat may be affected.
 If a proposed or listed species or critical habitat is present, the nearest Service field office should be consulted for information on appropriate protection measures and for any necessary incidental take permit or authorization.
 To determine locations of critical habitat, applicators can (a) check 50 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) � 17.94 -17.96 which can be found at http://www.gpo.gov or (b) contact the nearest Service field office.
 Pesticide users should determine where remnants of proposed or listed species habitat exist in border areas (fence lines, hedgerows, etc.) along rights-of-way and implement pesticide protection measures for these areas.
 Applicators using mechanized equipment in right-of-way corridors should use either liquid streams or relatively coarse sprays to minimize spray drift into species habitat.
 15.	To protect species inside or adjacent to municipal parks, golf courses, or other managed areas, the 	Service recommends � �
 	Applicators or relevant agencies using pesticides on managed areas (golf courses, municipal parks, etc.) in close proximity to proposed or listed species or critical habitat should identify areas on the facility where these species or critical habitat may be affected by facility operations.
 When pesticides and fertilizers can be transported into species habitat by spray drift or surface runoff, use of pesticides and fertilizers on the facility should be minimized and an integrated pest management (IPM) plan should be developed for the facility.
 Water quality in habitat of aquatic listed species should be monitored for habitat adjacent to managed areas, and water quality monitoring should also be part of the IPM plan.
 Pesticide users may contact the county extension service for assistance in developing an IPM plan.
 16.	To protect below ground or spring-dependent species from aquifer contamination, the Service recommends � �
 	a.	Pesticides with the least acute toxicity and persistence should be selected for use near open waterbodies or sensitive geologic features such as caves, sinkholes, crevices, etc.
 A pesticide�s potential for inducing chronic toxicity in below ground or spring-dependent animal species should be considered if (1) treatment involves repeated applications, (2) the pesticide is persistent, or (3) a chronic condition may occur in these species by a single application of pesticide.
 The ability of a pesticide to leach through the soil should also be considered, and highly soluble pesticides should be avoided.
 Nontoxic carrier materials or adjuvants (drift retardants, surfactants, etc.) should be used for any application.
 A determination of toxicity should be made for carrier materials or adjuvants through informational sources such as container labels or MSDSs (material safety data sheets) or by contacting the manufacturer.
 	b.	Use of pesticides in watersheds with below ground or spring-dependent species should be minimized including both ground water and surface water.
 Pesticides should be applied at minimal rates without repeated applications.
 Pesticide operations such as loading, storing, mixing, and rinsing of containers should be conducted away from springs, wells, and sensitive geologic features.
 Applicators should prevent pesticides from entering (1) ground water of the aquifer via percolation or leaching or (2) surface water that flows into storm drains or aquifer recharge features such as caves, sinkholes, crevices, etc.
 Pesticide spray drift should be confined to areas of treatment and not be allowed to move into nontarget areas.
 Where possible, pesticide applications should have a vegetated buffer strip of at least 30 feet in drainage areas of the treated area to minimize pesticide residues in surface runoff.
 	c.	A comprehensive watershed analysis should be conducted by Federal, state, or local agencies before implementing pesticide programs for control of pests or invasive species in watersheds that potentially involve below ground or spring-dependent species.
 After the watershed analysis has been conducted, further restrictions on pesticide application are unnecessary if the Service concurs that the pesticide control program will not impact these species.
 If a pesticide control program can affect underground or spring-dependent species, the Service should be consulted for appropriate protection measures and for any necessary incidental take authorization or permit.
 17.	To protect species with experimental populations, the Service recommends � �
 	Populations of listed species with experimental status should be located in areas of release before application of pesticides that can affect these species.
 Pesticide users should contact the nearest Service field office for applications involving (a) essential experimental populations on either public or private lands or (b) nonessential experimental populations in National Parks or National Wildlife Refuges.
 The Service should be consulted prior to pesticide treatment for appropriate protection measures and for any necessary incidental take authorization or permit.
 Additional special rules may also apply (see 50 CFR [Code of Federal Regulations] � 17.8, which can be found at http://www.gpo.gov).
 18.	To protect cat species (e.g., jaguar, jaguarundi, or ocelot), the Service recommends � �
 	a.	A survey should be conducted for the species in accordance with Service protocols before application of any predator/rodent control agent inside or close to species habitat.
 Pesticide users should contact the nearest Service field office for information on survey protocols.
 A scientific permit should be obtained from the Service before conducting a species survey.
 After a survey has been conducted, further restrictions on pesticide application are unnecessary if the Service concurs that the habitat is unoccupied by the species.
 For occupied habitat or habitat that has not been surveyed, the Service should be consulted prior to pesticide treatment for appropriate protection measures and for any necessary incidental take authorization or permit.
 	b.	The following predator/rodent control agents or any pesticide that can cause secondary poisoning (Class 1sp or 2sp) in the Predatory Mammal toxicity group should not be used within 3 miles of occupied habitat as defined by a Service-approved survey.

 27.	To protect animal species in large aquatic habitat, the Service recommends � �
 	a.	A survey should be conducted for the species in accordance with Service protocols before application of pesticide inside or adjacent to waterbodies and wetlands that serve as species habitat.
 Pesticide users should contact the nearest Service field office for information on survey protocols.
 A scientific permit should be obtained from the Service before conducting a species survey.
 After a survey has been conducted, further restrictions on pesticide application are unnecessary if the Service concurs that the habitat is unoccupied by the species.
 For occupied habitat or habitat that has not been surveyed, the Service should be consulted prior to pesticide treatment for appropriate protection measures and for any necessary incidental take authorization or permit.
 The Service should also be consulted before implementation of a pesticide program for control of pests or invasive species within 1 mile of aquatic habitat of the species.
 	b.	Applicators should not use the following aquatic pesticides or any other pesticide formulations labeled for aquatic use (piscicides, aquatic herbicides, mosquito control agents, etc.) inside waterbodies or wetlands serving as species habitat unless approved by the Service.
 This includes (1) all of the habitat area and (2) at least 1/2 mile upstream from the habitat area in any contributing channel, tributary, or spring run.
 Downstream from the habitat area, these aquatic pesticides should not be applied any closer than 300 feet.
 	c.	Applicators should use the following buffer zones for application of pesticides on land adjacent to waterbodies and wetlands that serve as species habitat.
 Recommended buffer zones should be used for (1) all of the habitat area and (2) at least 1/2 mile upstream from the habitat area in any contributing channel, tributary, or spring run.

 H	These applications and formulations can have a buffer zone of 350 feet at the edge of the waterbody or wetland to be protected if the pesticide is applied by a sprayer with low pressure nozzles that deliver a spray ranging from coarse to very coarse in droplet size.
 Notes:
 1	A buffer zone is the distance between the boundary of the area requiring protection and the closest point of the last spot application or application swath.
 Border areas (roadways, fence lines, canal dikes, etc.) may be used as part of a buffer zone if the border area itself does not involve species habitat or a sensitive area.
 Standard weather conditions for pesticide application (i.e., no temperature inversions, wind speeds between 3 to 10 miles per hour, and no rainfall for 48 hours) should be followed when implementing recommended buffer zones.
 2	Spot applications include pesticide applications by (1) hand-operated equipment or (2) a spray gun that discharges pesticide in liquid streams from a spray tank.
 3	Low and high aerial applications (respectively, aerial applications either less than 10 feet or greater than 10 feet) are relative to the height of the nozzles or spreaders above (1) the canopy of the field crop or native plant community or (2) a bare ground surface.
 In grassland or semi-open plant communities (shrubland, woodland, etc.) with more than 40 percent grass cover, the top of the grass canopy should be used to determine whether an aerial application is low or high.
 For forested lands or dense shrubland with less than 40 percent grass cover, the tops of trees or shrubs should be used in determining whether applications are low or high.
 4	Solid formulations include baits, granules, pellets, and treated seed but do not include dusts.
 5	Liquid formulations include any type of liquid-based formulation other than ULV formulations.
 6	ULV (ultra low volume) refers to liquid formulations applied at a rate of 1/2 gallon or less per acre.

 	�	Applicators or relevant agencies should contact the Arizona field office of the Service at 602-242-0210 to determine the current location of experimental ferret populations in Yavapai County, Arizona.
 	�	A ferret survey is recommended for prairie dog colonies in locations other than Yavapai County, Arizona.
 Colonies to be surveyed should be sufficiently large to support a small population of black-footed ferrets (i.e., black-tailed prairie dog colonies greater than 80 acres; white-tailed prairie dog colonies greater than 200 acres).
 A copy of survey guidelines for black-footed ferrets may be obtained from the regional pesticide coordinator in Austin at 512-490-0057.
 A scientific permit should be obtained from the Service before conducting a ferret survey.
 If a prairie dog colony is occupied by black-footed ferrets, the Service should be contacted.
 	�	The Service should be notified before treatment of prairie dog complexes larger than 1,000 acres.
 Control agents for prairie dogs should not be used in such a complex until the complex has been (1) systematically surveyed for black-footed ferrets and (2) evaluated by appropriate state and Federal agencies for its potential as a ferret recovery site.
 Additional surveys for the complex are recommended after an extended period of time.
 	b.	Applicators should not use the following rodent control agents in a prairie dog colony or any pesticide that can cause either secondary poisoning (Class 1sp or Class 2sp) or burrow fumigation (Class 2 b) in the Predatory Mammal toxicity group when black-footed ferrets are present.

 52.	To protect the red-cockaded woodpecker, the Service recommends � �
 	a.	A survey should be conducted for red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW) clusters in accordance with Service protocols before application of pesticide inside or adjacent to pine or pine-hardwood forest.
 A cluster is defined as one or more cavity nest trees with a 200-foot buffer (200 feet = 3 chains).
 Single clusters have a minimum of 10 acres with at least one cavity tree.
 Pesticide users should contact the nearest Service field office for information on survey protocols.
 A scientific permit should be obtained from the Service before conducting a species survey.
 A Service-approved survey will be accepted for up to one year if the survey does not detect the presence of active RCW clusters in areas targeted for pesticide application; however, areas with abandoned clusters must be re-surveyed before pesticide application can occur.
 After a survey has been conducted, further restrictions on pesticide application are unnecessary if the Service concurs that the habitat is unoccupied by the species.
 For occupied habitat or habitat that has not been surveyed, the Service should be consulted prior to pesticide treatment for appropriate protection measures and for any necessary incidental take authorization or permit.
 	b.	Pesticides should not be applied inside or adjacent to active RCW clusters or clusters that have not been determined by the Service to be abandoned.
 For control of pest or invasive plant species along existing rights-of-way (paved or gravel-base roadways only) inside RCW clusters, a non-persistent herbicide with a vegetable oil carrier may be used if the herbicide does not exceed Class 0 or Class 1 in the Small Avian toxicity group.
 Applicators should make sure that pesticide spray drift does not occur beyond the right-of-way by using pesticide sprays with (1) coarse droplet sizes or (2) nontoxic drift retardants.
 Applicators may conduct spot applications for selective control of mid-story hardwoods inside an RCW cluster away from existing rights-of-way by using a triclopyr pesticide (e.g., Garlon7 4) and a carrier material of diesel or sunflower oil.
 Treatment with the triclopyr pesticide should be made only if (1) treatment is approved by the Service, (2) a backpack sprayer is used to apply the pesticide in a basal streamline spray, and (3) the pesticide is applied outside the general breeding season of March 1 through July 31.

 	b.	Applicators or relevant agencies should not use the following burrow fumigants or any other burrow fumigant unless they have previously been trained to distinguish burrows of target species from burrows used by the desert tortoise.
 Individuals with adequate training to distinguish tortoise-inhabited burrows potentially include certified applicators and biologists of county extension services, state agricultural departments, or state/Federal wildlife management agencies.
 	c.	For application of pesticides (except for burrow fumigants as indicated above) inside occupied habitat or species habitat that has not been surveyed, measures to protect the species are:
 	�	Non-herbicidal pesticides (e.g., fungicides) rated as Class 0 in the Reptile toxicity group do not ordinarily require protection measures when these pesticides are applied inside occupied habitat or un-surveyed habitat.
 Applicators using these pesticides should make sure that adverse effects for proposed or listed species will not occur inside species habitat as a result of pesticide application.
 	�	A pesticide should not be used inside or adjacent to occupied habitat if the pesticide rates as (1) Class D, (2) Class M, (3) Class NS, or (4) any class higher than Class 0 in the Reptile toxicity group.
 An exception is application of herbicides (Classes D, M, or NS) that rate no higher than Class 1 in the Reptile toxicity group.
 These pesticides may be applied in existing rights-of-way through desert tortoise habitat.
 Applicators should make sure that pesticide spray drift does not occur beyond the right-of-way by using pesticide sprays with coarse droplet sizes from a spray gun or boom on a spray tank.
 55.	To protect the Barton Springs salamander, the Service recommends � �
 	Application of pesticides inside the following Pesticide Sensitive Areas should have the protection measures indicated below.
 The Service should be consulted before application of pesticide within 500 feet of species habitat in Main Springs, Eliza Springs, Sunken Garden Springs, or Upper Barton Springs inside Zilker Park in the city of Austin.
 The Service should also be consulted before implementation of a pesticide program for control of pests or invasive species inside a Pesticide Sensitive Area where pesticide residues may occur in runoff into the Edwards Aquifer.
 	a.	Applicators should not use the following aquatic pesticides or any other pesticide formulations labeled for aquatic use (piscicides, aquatic herbicides, mosquito control agents, etc.) inside or adjacent to species habitat unless approved by the Service.
 	b.	Applicators should use the following protection measures for application of pesticides on land adjacent to waterbodies and wetlands that contribute ground water or surface water to species habitat.
 	�	Pesticides that rate as Class 0 or Class 1 in the Aquatic Amphibian toxicity group should have the following buffer zones when applied at the edge of any waterbody or aquifer recharge feature (cave, sinkhole, crevice, etc.) within the Pesticide Sensitive Areas defined above.
 The buffer zones should also be used for pesticides that rate as Class 2 or Class 3 in the Aquatic Arthropod toxicity group but are not rated higher than Class 1 in the Aquatic Amphibian toxicity group.
 Alternative Buffer Zones:
 *	These applications and formulations can have a buffer zone of 50 feet at the edge of the waterbody or aquifer recharge feature (cave, sinkhole, crevice, etc.) to be protected if a strong, steady wind of at least 3 miles per hour is blowing directly away from the waterbody or recharge feature during the time of application.
 H	These applications and formulations can have a buffer zone of 50 feet at the edge of the waterbody or aquifer recharge feature (cave, sinkhole, crevice, etc.) to be protected if the pesticide is applied by a sprayer with low pressure nozzles that deliver a spray ranging from coarse to very coarse in droplet size.
 Notes:
 1	A buffer zone is the distance between the boundary of the area requiring protection and the closest point of the last spot application or application swath.
 Border areas (roadways, fence lines, canal dikes, etc.) may be used as part of a buffer zone if the border area itself does not involve species habitat or a sensitive area.
 Standard weather conditions for pesticide application (i.e., no temperature inversions, wind speeds between 3 to 10 miles per hour, and no rainfall for 48 hours) should be followed when implementing recommended buffer zones.
 2	Spot applications include pesticide applications by (1) hand-operated equipment or (2) a spray gun that discharges pesticide in liquid streams from a spray tank.
 3	Low and high aerial applications (respectively, aerial applications either less than 10 feet or greater than 10 feet) are relative to the height of the nozzles or spreaders above (1) the canopy of the field crop or native plant community or (2) a bare ground surface.
 In grassland or semi-open plant communities (shrubland, woodland, etc.) with more than 40 percent grass cover, the top of the grass canopy should be used to determine whether an aerial application is low or high.
 For forested lands or dense shrubland with less than 40 percent grass cover, the tops of trees or shrubs should be used in determining whether applications are low or high.
 4	Solid formulations include baits, granules, pellets, and treated seed but do not include dusts.
 5	Liquid formulations include any type of liquid-based formulation other than ULV formulations.
 6	ULV (ultra low volume) refers to liquid formulations applied at a rate of 1/2 gallon or less per acre.
 	�	Pesticides that rate as Class 2 or Class 3 in the Aquatic Amphibian toxicity group should have the appropriate buffer zone when applied at the edge of any waterbody or aquifer recharge feature (cave, sinkhole, crevice, etc.) within the Pesticide Sensitive Areas defined above.
 Alternative Buffer Zones:
 *	These applications and formulations can have a buffer zone of 80 feet at the edge of the waterbody or aquifer recharge feature (cave, sinkhole, crevice, etc.) to be protected if a strong, steady wind of at least 3 miles per hour is blowing directly away from the waterbody or recharge feature during the time of application.

 The majority of health problems I see in pet parrots, like yours, are caused by nutritionally imbalanced diets and the failure to feed pet birds the same fresh diets that keep the rest of us healthy.
 All sorts of disease problems that veterinarians see in pet parrots have, as their underlying problem, a poor diet.
 The things you find in commercial seed mixes and parrot pellets are things that no parrot in the wild ever ate.
 Until the 1960�s, most people fed their parrots seeds and most of these parrots were budgies.
 The seeds that were available were not the native Australian grass seeds that budgies normally consumed.
 They were the high-tech, farmed, oil and starch seeds that dominate the current agricultural business.
 About that time, an observant veterinarians in Niles Illinois, Ted Lafeber, noticed that his avian patients who consumed a wide variety of vegetables, fruits and grains, in addition to seeds, had less health problems and lived considerably longer than the ones given exclusively seeds.
 That observation led him to market the first formulated bird food in 1974.
 Dr.
 Lafeber�s observations were correct.
 All common seeds were too low in crucial vitamins, as well as important minerals and other nutrients.
 Seeds that these hookbills (parrots) loved to eat also contain too much fat for their lifestyle and too little protein.
 Their feathers � a mirror on their inner health - were brittle and lacked their normal luster and color.
 This led to obesity, increased susceptibility to disease and a shortened life-span.
 You can read more about another diet-linked problem , gout, in another article on this website.
 Absolutely none of the seeds you see in pet store are part of your parrot�s natural diet in the wild.
 Many of these seeds seem to produce a �high� shortly after they are eaten and depression when they are not available.
 And just like a mom who slaves over a wonderfully nutritious meal for her kids - and then placed a bowl of Snickers bars in the center of the table, parrots and macaws will go straight for the "candy bar" seeds and eat them until they are full.
 I have had so many clients prepare beautiful diets for their birds, only to have their little rascals carefully sort through the mix, eating only the portions that catch their eye.
 The problem is worse in hand-fed domestic parrots who may have been fed one, monotonous oil-rich diet during hand rearing or while hanging in a pet store.
 What Are Some Of The Warning Signs Of Poor Nutrition that I Might See?
 It is pretty obvious when a bird�s health is deteriorating due to its diet.
 I can tell when they walk in the clinic door, because the colors of their feathers are dull and faded.
 They never have the intense greens, reds,and blues one sees in wild parrots or those eating as if they were in the wild.
 I come from the Mexican border so I see a lot of double yellow-heads.
 When they walk in with what looks like a peroxide-blond hairdo, I know they are on seeds or the product of a Mexican dye-job.
 (it was common to dye the heads of all parrots yellow to sell to gullible gringos) The washed out yellow in this photo of a parrot at the Vancouver Aquarium, shows that the bird has not been eating an adequate diet for a considerable period of time.
 View it here.
 Parrots do not seem to obtain their red and yellow colorants from their diet the way many other birds do.
 (ref) (ref)
 Many owners are unaware of this because the pet came to them with that sort of plumage, because the color changes occurred slowly or they compare them to pet shop birds that all have the same problem.
 The next most obvious sign are frayed, or broken feathers or those that have individual veins with a brownish color.
 Some of these abnormalities are due to failures in feather formation, other times it is due to deprived birds chewing on themselves neurotically.
 If you want to determine which is the likely cause, see if the same abnormal feather on the opposite wing or portion of its body shares the same defects.
 If so, it is a feather formation problem.
 (If the feather just seems to �give up� during formation (particularly if your pet is a cockatoo, African grey, eclecuts or another non-south american species) the PFBV virus needs to be considered as well).
 Ref Ref
 Your pet�s two nostrils (nares) are located in that unfeathered triangle (cere) at the base of its beak.
 The cere should be soft and smooth and those two openings should be oval-round and wide.
 When the cere is crusty, scaly, or has an irregular, turtle-shell appearance, or the nares are pasty and narrowed with debris, the bird is not well.
 Barring a previous fight with another parrot or a wound to the cere, these two openings should be identical in shape, never round, never crusty and your bird should only sneeze on rare occasions.
 We think that a lack of sufficient vitamin A in your pet�s diet is the underlying cause of this problem.
 But often, by the time these pets arrive at my hospital, they already have a bacterial sinusitis and need more than a diet change.
 The unfeathered portion of your bird�s feet should have the look of full-grained leather � much like an alligator-skin purse.
 It should not be scurfy, scaly or patchy in its colors.
 The bird should stand high on its perch when it is alert, not slouched low to the perch.
 Nutritional deficiencies, obesity, respiratory/heart problems all cause birds to rest their keel (breastbone) close to or on the perch.
 While I am on it, their tail should never bob up and down as they breath.
 There are many other possible causes, but incomplete molts often occur in nutritionally deprived birds.
 (you can go back to my ref for more on that) that)
 Since every system in your bird�s body depends on proper nutrition, any health problem is possible when a pet doesn't eat right.
 (That is why I always have clients bring me a food sample, as well as the tray liner from their cage when they bring in the parrot) What�s in the food cup isn�t as important as the hulls and scraps on the cage bottom that tell me what the pet is actually consuming or dropping to the bottom whole.
 Their poop tells me a lot as well.
 The color isn�t all that important (unless it contains blood).
 It is the stool contents, their degree of digestion, and the presence or absence of mucus that tells me most.
 If you drag a toothpick through the pet�s poop, it should not trail along behind.
 Veterinarians often stain a specimen for bacteria and yeast.
 Digestive tract yeast infections do not occur in parrots that receive good diets and care.
 Much of what is diagnosed as a �yeast infection� is actually malnutrition.
 Yeast spores are present in all the grains products you feed your bird (and that you eat yourself) and they come out in the stool whole.
 But it is exceedingly rare for them to be the source of a health problem.
 Much of what is diagnosed as an oral yeast infection in birds is probably just a nutritional deficiency.
 If your veterinarian finds that the bird's stool contains too many gram negative bacteria, antibiotics are only a temporary fix and so are bacterial pastes - paste bacteria will not live if gut conditions are not right for them.
 But If you concentrate on cage sanitation, proper environment and a varied plant-based diet, the gram positive bacteria will return on their own.
 Diets Rich In Industrial Seeds Seeds
 I call them industrial seeds for lack of a better word.
 You can read about the good and the bad of them here.
 These are all the cereal and other staple grains that are planted and harvested from mechanized farms throughout the World.
 Over centuries, these plants have been selected to produce seeds in huge amounts that are high in carbohydrate, high in fat, low in vitamins, and low in protein.
 It is a zero-sum game.
 If you want huge crop yields, you have to sacrifice something.
 In trading quantity for quality, these plants all require human beings to complete their growing cycle.
 These industrial seeds include, corn, millet, safflower, sunflower, peanuts and hemp.
 It matters not, if these seeds are �All Organic�, �All Natural�, �Pesticide Free� �Wellness Blend�, etc.
 etc.
 They are all naturally injurious to your pet�s health if they form too much of its diet.
 It doesn�t matter if they are ground up, fed whole, pelletized, sprayed with colors, given nice aromas, sprayed with vitamins, offered in flashy containers or offered for sale by �avian experts�.
 Their time as the primary diet component for conscientious pet owners has passed.
 Seed diets have done-in many more pet parrots than all infectious diseases combined.
 Parrots love them - just like kids love Snickers.
 Some folks say that if you lay out a healthy diet for your pet, it will select the right blend for itself.
 That�s like cooking a healthy diet for your kids and then putting a bowl of M&Ms and pop tarts in the center.
 What do you think will happen?(ref) happen?(ref)
 Seeds and grain products, pelleted or not, should make up, at the most, about 25% of your pet�s diet.
 Feeding your pet seeds also brings with it the dangers of aflatoxins.
 I�ll mention a bit more about that later; but if you are going to feed whole seeds or peanuts, pick out any broken, defective, cracked or discolored ones and throw those away.
 They are the ones with the most potential for high aflatoxin content.
 When seed mixes are dyed, ground up or coated with a vitamin concoction, picking out the bad ones becomes impossible.
 (Incidentally, those vitamin/mineral coatings just end up on the cage floor.) floor.)
 Industrial seeds are chiefly made up of empty carbohydrates.
 Many are quite high in oil as well.
 They are not at all like the seeds, growing wild in nature, which a wild parrot might encounter.
 They tend to be quite low in vitamins D and A, some of the B-vitamins, calcium, and trace elements.
 It is said that what protein they do have is often unbalanced, being deficient in the amino acids lysine and methionine.
 (ref).
 So Why Do So Many People Still Feed Seeds ?
 Sometimes folks just do the easy thing � pick up a box of Hartz at your grocery store or some �premium� seed brand at the pet Megastore - and get on to other things.
 Seed diets are cheap � that is, until your bird gets sick.
 Pet birds love seed diets - true but unfortunate.
 Seed diets store well � actually, they don�t, you just can�t see the dangerous spoilage.
 Pet stores feed their birds seeds so why shouldn�t I?
 You love your bird - they don�t.
 Feeding fresh produce is so messy! My parrot slings it on the walls and floor and the cage area smells like the farmer�s market on Sunday.
 If you want a neat, low maintenance pet - think twice before purchasing a parrot.
 I used to care for performing bears with the Ringling Bros.
 Circus.
 The acts always fed them 80% day-old white bread and 20% Old Roy dog chow.
 A very perceptive, third generation, bear trainer once confided in me, after his son was mauled, that if he increased the amount of dog chow, the bears became too unpredictable.
 He thought his son had been feeding them too much dog chow and he knew they were only docile and easy to handle when the amount of dog chow was kept low.
 He was convinced that there was something in Old Roy dog chow that made his bears �mean�.
 He was wrong.
 Bears are naturally dangerous; his were slow, disinterested and weak from malnutrition.
 It�s much the same with parrots.
 Parrots on bad diets don�t scream as much, they are less aggressive and destructive, they spend much of their time sleeping with their head tucked under a wing and they don�t molt and produce feather shaft fluff or powder down as much.
 Some folks find birds in that condition easier to live with.
 I don�t scold these clients; they love their pets just as much as you love yours.
 It�s that, like the bear trainer, they just haven�t connected the dots right.
 Pelleted And Extruded Diets Diets
 Dr.
 Lafeber was followed by many other entrepreneurs.
 They all thought that if they took the known nutritional needs of chickens and added the missing ingredients to industrial grains, they could come up with an ideal product.
 What we ended up with are today�s pellets, which are kind of like military K-rations or meals-ready-to-eat.
 Throw all the required stuff in a pot, grind it up, heat it up, press it through an extruder, add a slick marketing campaign and a nifty bag and Vuala! - the perfect parrot food.
 Most aviculturalists use the words pelleted diet and extruded diet interchangeably and that is fine.
 But in production, extruded diets pass through a process of higher heat and pressure than pelleted diets.
 Today, most are extruded.
 I have great respect for the late Dr.
 Lafeber.
 His idea was an enormous advancement in pet bird nutrition.
 In fact, it was the beginning of pet bird nutrition.
 I would call him at his Animal Hospital in Niles, Illinois and we�d chew the fat over a difficult case.
 His pellets were convenient, the birds couldn�t sort through to pick and choose, they had enough vitamin A and D-3 and Calcium and they corrected the amino acid imbalance by adding lysine and methionine.
 Feeding this diet was light-years more health than feeding a seed diet.
 Suddenly, budgies and cockatiels were living so much longer.
 Today, there are many brands to choose from.
 I am fond of Mazuri products, but there are many other good brands.
 However, with time, problems in birds fed solely pellets became apparent.
 For one, pellets robbed the pet of foraging time, exercise and exploration - all important part of your bird�s mental health.
 Like prison or institutional food, prepared by certified nutritionists you won�t develop scurvy or beriberi eating it, but you may eventually flip out.
 Or you might eat so much of it out of boredom that your weight skyrockets.
 Another potential worry are the mold toxins that are common in industrial grains - the basis of all pellets.
 They are called mycotoxins and I will discuss them a bit later.
 Avian pellets are marketed as nutritionally �complete�.
 The problem is that we really have no idea what that means.
 We know what will keep a chicken alive and free from illness for a year or two and all pellet producers start there.
 But the few studies in pet birds have been of very short duration, and, to the best of my knowledge, always conducted by the same person or organization marketing the product.
 (that didn't stop the AAFCO from issuing pet bird nutritional guidelines in 1998) That is very disturbing to me when we are talking about feeding one product or very similar products monotonously over 20 �30 years.
 That is entirely unlike the situation God anticipated when he created these creatures to flutter here and there, following the maturing of wild fruits, buds, seeds and berries.
 He designed them to thrive on nutritional variety, not nutritional adequacy.
 Another problem with stored cereal-based pellets is what happens to them after they leave the factory.
 When you buy them from feed store, online or from your veterinarians, you never know how long they sat on the shelf, at what temperature, and with what exposure to gnawing rodents.
 I avoid products that have been dyed with anything but products similar to the anthocyanins dyes of red cabbage and blueberries.
 It is safer to purchase a non-dyed product and sprinkle grated carrot, red cabbage or blueberries in it.
 Is There A Place For Pellets In My Pet�s Diet ?
 Yes, the secret to a healthy diet for your parrot is variety - and pellets can be a part of that variety.
 Just don�t feed them in the amounts that the manufacturers suggest.
 When they suggest 80% pellets and 20% mixed fruits and vegetables � reverse that number.
 The Problem of Mold Toxins In Industrial Grains Grains
 Mold toxins (mycotoxins, aflatoxins) are a constant hazard in the industrial grain industry for humans and pets alike.
 They are phantom poisons, tasteless, odorless, appearing suddenly in one field of corn and not the next.
 Some times these fungi are present in large amounts but produces no toxins, other times the opposite occurs.
 Sometimes (usually) the toxins are present before harvest but they can also appear during storage.
 They are impervious to cooking heat and no process has yet been developed that destroys them.
 (There is more about them in the article of mine on Avian Gout) Gout)
 Currently, the US government allows a maximum of 20 ppb (parts per billion) of combined aflatoxins in human food.
 (ref) Canada only allows 15 ppb and the European Union only 4 ppb.
 For human infants, the maximum amount in the US is 0.5 ppb; in Europe 0.1 ppb.
 So much of the premium Minnesota corn leaves for Europe.
 Birds appear to be less resistant to aflatoxins than many mammals.(ref) When US corn exceeds 20 ppb, it gets sold as deer corn, cut with clean corn to drop the reading to legal levels, or shipped overseas.
 Marketers of avian products will tell you that scientific studies show that the level it takes to kill birds is much higher than that in their products.
 But the studies they quote were not run in parrots and were for acute (rapid) toxicity, not chronic (long term) exposure.
 (A few puffs on a cigarette won't hurt you, but a lifetime of smoking will) will)
 I check with Purina/Mazuri Mills from time to time to see what their aflatoxin readings are running.
 If your avian pellet supplier won�t provide aflatoxin, fumonisin and DON (vomitoxin) levels in their finished pellet (determined with test as sensitive as the Charm Rosa test) - shop elsewhere.
 What Do Wild Parrots Eat?
 Wild parrots are wary birds and I know, from personal experience, that they are very hard to observe.
 Most learned long ago that humans constituted a danger.
 When they do slow down, it is usually to kibitz, snooze and idly nibble at the branches that surround them.
 Wild parrots eat primarily the seeds of trees in their various stages, ripe and less ripened fruit, buds and fresh growth, various flowers and occasionally bark.(ref 1, ref 2, ref 3, ref 4) They move between food sources seasonally as one or the other becomes more available.
 Here in South Texas and Tamaulipas State, they are considerably leaner in the winter months when food is less available.
 It is very hard to find information on the specific amounts of nutrients that wild parrots consume.
 Jungle primates compete with parrots for many of the same food resources.
 Slightly more research has been done on their needs to gain insights on human diets and for now , it is the best information we have.
 (ref 1 , ref 2 ) To subsist in the jungle canopy over a complete year, an enormous variation in dietary ingredients is required.
 (ref) (ref)
 The best additional information on the subject may come out of the research of Dr.
 Donald Brightsmith at Texas A&M University.
 You can read about it through this link and you might even decide to support his efforts.
 If My Pet Is Currently Eating Only Seeds, How Should I Convert It Over To A More Nutritious Diet ?
 Parrots are very stubborn and obstinate about changes of any kind in their diets.
 They still have a wildlife mentality, and in the wild, new situations usually mean new dangers to be avoided.
 I never suggest that diets be changed in these pets cold turkey (abruptly).
 Doing so can cause unseen health problems to accelerate and the lives of smaller or weaker pets will be put in danger doing so.
 A healthy unclipped or moderately clipped parrot should be able to fly 15-20 feet without becoming exhausted, mouth breathing, or having its tail bob up and down.
 If there is any doubts in your mind as to the health of your parrot, have it checked out by an avian-savy veterinarian before attempting any diet changes.
 In general, it is easier to change a parrot�s diet from pellet to fresh than from seeds to pellet.
 In making your changes, you must be very patient.
 Usually, the bird will simply ignore the new food item(s) for quite some time or simply throw them out of its food dish.
 Younger pets are usually more curious and accepting of new food items.
 Birds that once ate food items they no longer receive will accept them again much faster than those that never received them.
 I have found that things go smoother and progress faster if you calculate the amount of seed that you bird consumes in a day.
 At daybreak, give your pet only a third of that in a dish next to the pellets or mixed in with the pellets.
 Then wait until about 3 pm before giving it the rest of its seed.
 Of course, spray millet, hanging treat toys, and other edibles need to go for this to work.
 Buy a postage scale that is accurate to a gram, place a perch on it and weigh the bird daily.
 Its weight needs to remain steady unless it was already obese from eating the seeds.
 If you know how to tell the difference between the poop and the urine portions of your pet�s droppings, be sure the poop portion does not decrease.
 The color of the poop will change as its diet changes this is of no consequences unless there is obvious blood in the stool.
 Sometimes, the worry and stress of changing a parrots diet is more than a loving owner can withstand.
 In those cases, or when birds are already clinically ill, diet changes often go better at an avian animal hospital or the home of a wise avian professional where birds can be accurately weighed, monitored and, if necessary, be fed by tube during the conversion.
 There is no reason you cannot offer seeds, pellets and fresh produce all at the same time.
 Some birds are more resistant to this sort of diet change, but a few will begin eating everything after two to five weeks.
 If you try that approach, dice the produce to the same size as the seeds and pellets and be sure your bird is not going light (loosing weight).
 Color, size and presentation are very important in drawing the curiosity of new foods to your pet.
 Basically, try any number of tricks and encouragement:
 extra feed bowels, crushed pellets, snippets or mashed small pieces of fruit and vegetable, pellets dipped in fruit juice, pellets placed here and there in the cage, etc.
 Once their wariness is broken, curiosity about new foods rushes out of them like water out of a dam.
 The colorful Nutri Berries that Lafeber Co.
 markets can be helpful in encouraging your pet to open up to new food ideas.
 But I would not feed them continuously as more than a small portion of your pet�s diet.
 A top dressing of brightly colored veggies, like carrot scrapings, diced spinach or purple cabbage makes some parrots bolder about testing new foods.
 Use your ingenuity, read online what has worked for others.
 Do not panic when the consistency, volume and color of your pet�s droppings change.
 Please Give Me A Shopping List To Take To The Grocery Store Store
 There are better parrot chiefs than I.
 I started a list for you, but it got too long to publish.
 So instead, I collage the photo at the top of this page to give you inspiration.
 Just visit the websites of parrot enthusiasts for other good ideas.
 When you do, look to the left and right of your monitor.
 If a whole bunch of adds are running or they are offering to sell you stuff, take their advice with a grain of salt.
 I like Pamela Clark's website.
 You can visit it.
 But please do not go overboard on any one ingredient - and lay off the industrial grains.
 I prefer that fresh ingredients be cooked or at least brought to a boil because bacterial contamination of foodstuffs is always a threat.
 Organically grown vegetables and fruit should be lower in pesticides and chemical residues.
 But wash all food items well, even the organic ones.
 Be sure your pet always has a container of fresh, clean water.
 There is no harm in giving your parrot table scraps in small, varied amounts if you, yourself eat healthy.
 Some of the healthiest parrots I ever saw were the pets of the mountain peasants of Northern Mexico.
 They ate whatever their owners ate.
 Unfortunately, that changed when Frito Lay (Sabritas) began distributing junk food in the mountains.
 Now, neither the peasants nor their parrots eat healthy.
 I don�t suggest you give your parrot meat ,chicken or fish, although they will eat them.
 But then, I myself do not eat meat, chicken or fish.
 If you want to give your pet parrots animal protein, crumble up portions of hard-boiled egg.
 (Most of the protein is in the egg white), not the yolk.
 (Be sure they are cooked completely hard) Don�t throw away the shells, dry them, grind them to a fine powder in a coffee grind and sprinkle them on the bird�s diet.
 Just do whatever you do in moderation.
 Do not give your parrot chicken bones.
 I have also had clients whose birds developed bloody diarrhea after gnawing on spongy beef or pork bones.
 Some people have successfully fed avocado to their parrots.
 However, since avocado leaves, stems and peel are known to be poisonous, I would not feed any avocado-containing product to your parrot.
 There is no one, perfect parrot diet any more than there is one, perfect human diet.
 All animals have the ability to adapt to a variety of food sources - within reason.
 Some bird enthusiasts suggest placing the cage of a seed-addicted hookbill alongside one of a parrot already accepting a balanced diet.
 I have never tried that.
 But I have released sunflower seed-addicted parrots directly into my aviaries to mingle with the birds that were already eating healthy and the new arrivals rapidly began eating whatever the other parrots were eating.
 If you attempt something like that, be sure of the health of all the birds and the quality of the care they will receive.
 Do not mix parrots of different sizes, and don�t do it when any of the flock is in breeding condition (aggressive).
 It is a bit like putting a couch potato in with a group of marathon runners.
 What Is A Sensible Diet?
 There is more that we do not know than that we know about the ideal diet for typical pet parrots.
 Because of that, and the natural feeding patterns of parrots, the most important thing you can do is to feed variety.
 I feed my parrots a diet that is about 10-15% seeds, 20% avian pellets and the rest fruits and vegetables.
 I do not think you will find two parrot breeders that agree on the subject.
 If you are hesitant, find a medium size successful parrot-breeding aviary in your area and begin by doing what they do.
 Just remember, the nutritional needs of breeding parrots and those out-of-doors flight-housed parrots are greater than your pet�s.
 Just like with human athletes, breeding birds require much greater protein, carbohydrate and fat loads than your sedentary (couch potato) bird can tolerate.
 Protein Protein
 Cooked beans are an excellent source of protein.
 I have fed cooked lentils, garbanzo beans, soybeans, pinto beans kidney beans and peas.
 I occasionally add hard-boiled egg white.
 We think that a diet (in dried form) that contains 10-16% protein is about right for a house-pet parrot.
 Breeding birds, younger growing birds and some sick birds will benefit from more protein as will parrots that are in full-blown molt .
 Some vets associate gout in parrots with diets that are too rich in protein.
 Stress feather bars, easily broken feathers and dull, imperfect plumage are often associated with a diet too low in protein.
 Do not feed your parrot raw, uncooked beans.
 They and industrial grains, contain a lot of phytic acid which can lock up minerals and vitamins (niacin) in your pet�s diet.
 If you do not want to feed them cooked, feed them sprouted.
 Both cooking and sprouting seem to reduce the amount of poorly understood antimetabolites.
 Carbohydrates Carbohydrates
 Cereal grain products, seeds and starchy vegetables all provide an abundance of carbohydrates.
 Products containing chiefly wheat, rye barley, rice, buckwheat, and oats are mainly carbohydrates.
 Feed your pet several carbohydrate sources, not just one or two.
 Fats and Oils Oils
 You need only be concerned with providing fats if your parrot has exceptionally high caloric or metabolic needs.
 Birds that need fats and oils might be those that are emaciated (very thin), suffering from intestinal absorption problems, housed under severe cold, or currently feeding offspring.
 Fiber Fiber
 Industrial grains and most nuts are low in fiber; beans and many fruits and vegetables are quite high in it.
 The wild diets of parrots are considerably higher in fiber than pellets or seeds.
 I do not know of specific medical problems in parrots that have been associated with a lack of fiber in their diet.
 There short digestive tracts seem to protect them from the constipation seen in mammals that do not get enough fiber; but we know that in chicken-like birds (with digestive tracks quite unlike parrots), fiber affect the shape and function of the digestive tract.
 (ref) and that its presence influences the bacteria types that will thrive in its digestive tract.
 (ref) so I assume that if you do not provide the moderately high-fiber diets that parrots were designed to consume, there will eventually be a price of some kind to pay.
 Does My Parrot Need A Vitamin/Mineral Supplement?
 Not if it is eating the type of diet I suggest.
 It is only in cases of severe malnutrition, weakened emaciated birds, or birds with specific health problems that vitamin/mineral products and tonics might have a place.
 If your pet is stubbornly refusing to eat a balanced diet, get some professional advice before resorting to spiking its current diet with a vitamin/mineral mix.
 Besides, overdoses of vitamins A & D are as dangerous as receiving not enough.
 If you have an African Grey parrot and your veterinarian suspects a low-calcium problem, adding a calcium supplement until you are sure it is eating a calcium-rich diet is always a good idea.
 If you are worried about their vitamin D needs, expose them to unfiltered sunshine in the summer and avian full-spectrum bulbs in the winter.
 Sprouts Sprouts
 Anything that you feed your parrot in dry form that will grow, can be fed in sprouted form.
 (Just never attempt to make sprouts out of seeds intended to be planted in a garden because they have added chemicals.) chemicals.)
 It appears that the sprouting process improves the availability of the nutrients in seeds as well as adding additional nutrients that were not there before.
 Fiber content increases, protein availability improves and fatty acid content is enhanced.
 I would not give your parrot commercially produced raw sprouts because of my fear of bacterial contamination.
 I never gave my parrots sprouts because I never had the time or staff to prepare them.
 But many parrot owners swear by them.
 Is My Parrot Over Weight?
 Just like us, pet parrots become fat due to boredom , inactivity and a calorie-rich diet.
 The secret to returning to slimness is no different than in humans:
 eat less calories, bulk your diet with low-cal foods and fiber, get more exercise and keep occupied with activities other than eating.
 There is an overweight parrot to the right of this photo.
 When you know your pet�s weight and want to know its ideal weight, weigh breeding birds of the same species and sex housed in flights and remember that a few grams overweight is a big deal to a tiny parrot.
 I have an article on monkeys with the same problem and much of that advice applies to your parrot as well.
 Read it here.
 Obesity and excess is not just a problem in adult pet parrots.
 It is also a danger to parrot breeders hand-raising parrot chicks.
 Fat babies are not, necessarily healthy babies.
 Excessive vitamin D and mineral in the formulas can cause gout problems later in life.
 They also put undo stress on leg bones that can leading to spraddle leg.
 I once managed the health of a large flock of penguins for Sea World.
 We were concerned with the large number of hunch-backed birds and foot problems occurring in our hand-raised gentoo penguins.
 I suspected that it was occurring because the chicks were gaining weight to rapidly and finally located some wild gentoo growth curves.
 Gentoos are dotting mothers -, just like parrot breeders.
 Sometimes two sets of parents adopt the same chick.
 The growth curves showed that when that occurred, the chick had the potential to grow unbelievably fast - faster than their bones could support them.
 It was the parents ability to find fish, not the chicks appetite that regulated its growth rate.
 The same goes for parrot chicks, you can overload them with nutrients placing undue stress on their bones and organs before they are ready.
 Is An Unhealthy Diet The Cause Of Avian Gout?
 Yes, I believe that in many cases, it is.
 Gout in parrots occurs when the bird�s kidneys are damaged and can no longer excrete sufficient uric acid.
 Kidney health is tied to diet.You can read more about that problem (here) (here)
 Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids acids
 Omega-3 fatty acids have been recommended for just about every medical condition known to man.
 I used to be quite skeptical that any compound could be effective for everything, but I have seen publications that are changing my mind.
 (ref1, ref2).
 The most acceptable explanation for me is the one that equates their beneficial effects to their ability to decrease inflammation in any part of the body.
 So go ahead and give them � but in moderate, appropriate amounts.
 I suggest you use an oilseed/nut source rather than fish oil.
 (ref) (ref)
 Feeding commercial nuts in quantity is not a good idea.
 They are very fatty - something lazy house pets do not need.
 And some, particularly peanuts pistachios and almonds, can be high in aflatoxins.
 (ref) .
 Parrots love nuts and, in the wild, many parrots consume them.
 But farmed, commercially available nuts can have a mold toxin (aflatoxin) problem.
 (ref) (ref)
 When you do feed nuts, purchase whole kernels or shelled nuts and discard any that are not perfect in form and color.
 If they smell musty, throw them away.
 Do Different Kinds Of Parrots Require Different Dietary Nutrients ?
 Perhaps.
 If and when they do, it is probably related to their different feeding habits and lifestyles rather than to any specific metabolic needs of particular birds.
 Pionus parrots, African Grey and Hyacinth macaws come to mind.
 There is really no scientific data I know of on the subject, and I have not owned them for long enough periods of time or in large enough numbers.
 If you own one of those species, defer to the recommendations of successful breeders.
 None of my diet suggestions apply to Lories or Lorikeets.
 How Often Should I Feed My Parrot?
 I feed my parrots � about an hour after sunrise and again in mid-afternoon to correspond with their wild inclinations.
 Parrot group feeding seems to be an immensely enjoyable time for them.
 Its a social activity that keeps them content with lots of squawking an interaction.
 Parrots are messy birds, and food mess attracts rodents and other vermin.
 Clean up your indoor or outdoor cage areas every day.
 Encourage Your Pet To Exercise:
 Most commercial cockatiel, parrot and parakeet cages are much too small.
 Birds were not designed by God to walk from place to place.
 For their circulatory system to function well, they need to fly - or at least flap.
 Letting your bird fly loose in the house is very dangerous.
 But you can build a flight cage.
 The cage must be long, but it does not have to be wide or deep.
 (Big parrots and macaws do not like to fly if they think their wing tips might brush up against objects).
 Flighted birds are also in danger of escaping or crashing into windows, fans and mirrors.
 But by clipping enough of the secondary wing feathers so the bird can only fly a few feet.
 you can solve this problem.
 Do not clip only one wing as this gives the bird a tendency to roll.
 I occasionally imp flightless parrots to get them off the ground � the same as falconers do.
 They just love to preen their new feathers � even when I have to use cockatoo primaries on a macaw or vice versa.
 Natural Sunlight Sunlight
 Expose your bird to natural sunlight for at least 1-2 hour a day.
 If the light passes through window glass, the time must be considerably longer.
 This allows the bird to re-establish it's normal body rhythms and produce adequate amounts of vitamin D3.
 If you cannot do that, utilize full-spectrum lamps designed for reptiles or birds.
 Just be sure the birds cannot gnaw the cords.
 Encourage Water Consumption Consumption
 Encourage extra water intake by having multiple water containers of different color and shape.
 Feed fun fruits and vegetables that are high in water.
 Many toxins, pesticides and antimetabolites present in food are eliminated through the urine portion of your pet�s stool.
 Well-hydrated birds have an advantage when dealing with them.
 Technical Information - Pesticides Pesticides
 What are Pesticides?
 Introduction - How Insecticides Enter the Insect Body - Miscellaneous Pesticides - Pesticide Groups Groups
 Introduction Introduction
 A pesticide is defined as a substance or mixture of substances intended for destroying, repelling or mitigating any pest.
 A pest is any living thing that exists where it is not wanted.
 Ideally, a pesticide should control a pest but not be detrimental to humans or other non-target organisms in the environment.
 The following is a brief glossary of pesticides used in the pest control industry:
 Pesticide Used Against Against
 Acaricide (Miticide) Mites Mites
 Avicide Birds Birds
 Fungicide Fungi Fungi
 Herbicide Weeds Weeds
 Insecticides Insects and related animals such as spiders, millipedes and centipedes centipedes
 Molluscicides Snails and slugs slugs
 Nematicides Nematodes Nematodes
 Rodenticides Rats, mice or other rodents rodents
 How Insecticides Enter the Insect Body Body
 Insecticides enter the insect body by three common ways; by contact, as stomach poisons or as fumigants.
 Many pesticides may enter the body by more than one of these possible routes.
 Contact Insecticides Insecticides
 Insecticides in this class kill pests by contacting and entering their bodies either directly through the insect integument (skin) into the blood or by entering the respiratory system through the spiracles (air valves along the side of an insect's body which control gas exchange).
 These materials may be applied directly to the insect body or as a residue on plant or animal surfaces, habitations or other places frequented by insects.
 In cases where residues are used, pests usually contact the pesticide through their tarsi (feet).
 Generally speaking, coarse sprays or dusts are a more effective means of applying contact insecticides than are mists or fogs.
 Most of the synthetic organic compounds act as contact insecticide, although many also confer stomach and fumigant activity.
 Stomach Poisons Poisons
 Stomach poisons must be swallowed in order to cause death.
 They may be formulated as liquids, dusts, pastes, granules or baits.
 In the case of liquids and dusts, the pesticide is usually applied to some substance on which the animal will chew or walk through.
 Pastes, bait and granules may be formulated with a feeding attractant which is consumed by the pest.
 Inorganic and botanical insecticides in general are predominantly stomach poisons.
 Some synthetic organic insecticides may also act in this capacity.
 Fumigant Pesticides Pesticides
 Gaseous poisons used to kill pests are called fumigants.
 Their applications are usually limited to materials, structures or organisms that can be or are enclosed in a tight enclosure.
 There are many fumigants, some distinctly odorless, while others are used in conjunction with odorless fumigants as a warning agent because of their odor.
 Many can be used safely about food products and most are very stable at stipulated temperatures.
 Some combine with commodities to produce corrosion or undesirable gases.
 When properly used, a fumigant is non-flammable and unlike any other forms of pesticides, kills all the developmental stages of an animal.
 In the case of insects, this includes the egg, larvae, pupae, and adults.
 When a fumigant reaches the appropriate concentration, it will kill pests quicker than any other pesticide.
 Miscellaneous Pesticides Pesticides
 This group includes pesticides which may enter the body through any one or more of the previously mentioned means, but have some specialized mode of action or means of application.
 Systemic Insecticides Insecticides
 Systemic insecticides act mainly as stomach poisons.
 However these chemicals are typically applied to one area of a plant or animal and are translocated to another area.
 In the case of plants, systemics are typically applied to the roots or stems of a plant and move through the vascular system to the leaves.
 Examples are Systox, Thimet and Disyston.
 Desiccant Dusts Dusts
 When applied to an insect, these materials absorb or abrade off the outer waxy layer of the insect's cuticle, causing the loss of body fluids and death by dehydration.
 The common desiccating dusts used by pest control operators are silica aerogel and boric acid.
 Chemosterilants Chemosterilants
 There are chemicals which cause sexual sterility in either the male or female insect or animal.
 Chemosterilants have not yet been used on a commercial basis.
 Pheromones Pheromones
 These are chemicals which may be of potential use in preventing insect mating when used to saturate the habitat.
 Antimetabolites Antimetabolites
 These are chemicals which interfere with the normal metabolic or physiological processes of animals.
 Pesticide Groups Groups
 Pesticide classification or grouping may be based on any of several criteria.
 One of the most common means of classifying a pesticide is on the basis of similarities in chemical structure.
 Based on this mode of classification, there are 3 classes of pesticides commonly used in the structural pest control industry, the inorganic, botanical, and synthetic organic insecticides.
 Inorganic Pesticides Pesticides
 Inorganic pesticides are typically derived from minerals or chemical compounds that occur as deposits in nature.
 Most of these compounds are quite stable and tend to accumulate in the environment.
 Some act as stomach poisons (borates and boric acid).
 Others are considered sorptive dusts (silica aerogel, diatomaceous earth) that absorb the waxy layer from the cuticle of pests.
 Many of the inorganic pesticides are relatively expensive and are only moderately effective in controlling insects and other pests.
 Common inorganic pesticides are silica aerogel, boric acid, borates, diatomaceous earth, cryolite, copper, and sulfur.
 Botanicals Botanicals
 The botanical pesticides are extracted from various parts (stems, seeds, roots, flower heads) of different plant species.
 Botanical insecticides usually have a short residual activity and do not accumulate in the environment or in fatty tissues of warm blooded animals.
 Many botanical pesticides act as stomach poisons, although pyrethrins act mainly as a contact poison.
 Common examples of botanical pesticides are pyrethrins, sabidilla, rotenone, nicotine, ryania, neem, and limonene.
 Synthetic Organic Insecticides Insecticides
 Synthetic organic insecticides do not naturally occur in the environment, but are synthesized by man.
 Since all these compounds have carbon and hydrogen atoms as the basis of their molecule (as do living plants and animals), they are referred to as organic compounds.
 The four basic types of synthetic organic insecticides are the chlorinated hydrocarbons, organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroids.
 Chlorinated Hydrocarbons Hydrocarbons
 This large group of insecticides varies considerably in toxicity to mammals.
 Most are only moderately toxic, however, a few are very toxic to mammals.
 The use of these materials has been severely criticized for their effect on the environment.
 Most chlorinated hydrocarbons are very stable and do not readily decompose in the environment.
 Most of these insecticides accumulate in the environment and in fatty tissues of birds and mammals.
 The use of most chlorinated hydrocarbons has been prohibited in the U.S..
 Examples of the chlorinated hydrocarbons are DDT, BHC, dieldrin, chlordane, aldrin, endrin, heptachlor and methoxychlor.
 Organophosphates Organophosphates
 The organophosphates are an extremely large and diverse group of insecticides.
 Their toxicity to mammals range from extremely toxic to some of the least toxic pesticides known.
 Most organophosphoates are not persistent and will break down to non-toxic materials in one to 30 days, depending on the compound.
 Organophosphates do not accumulate in fatty materials and do not accumulate in food chains.
 These compounds act mainly as contact insecticides although they may also act as stomach poisons and fumigants.
 Common organophosphates are malathion, chlorpyrifos (Dursban), diazinon, dichlorvos (Vapona), acephate (Orthene), and propetamphos (Safrotin).
 Carbamates Carbamates
 The carbamate compounds are also a large group of insecticides.
 As a rule, these compounds are slightly more persistent in the environment than the organophorphrous compounds, but do not accumulate in the environment or fatty tissues of mammals.
 Most carbamates are only moderately toxic to mammals.
 They mainly act as contact insecticides with some stomach activity.
 Common carbamate insecticides are carbaryl (Sevin) and propoxur (Baygon).
 Insect Growth Regulators Regulators
 Insect growth regulators are chemicals that affect the ability of insects to growth and mature normally.
 They are based on and often mimic the growth hormones that occur naturally within the insect's body.
 Because mammals do not molt like insects do, most insect growth regulators are not very toxic to man and domestic animals.
 Common insect growth regulators are methoprene (Precor), hydroprene (Gentrol, Gencor), fenoxycarb (Torus), and hexaflumuron (Sentricon) (Sentricon)
 Microbial Pesticides Pesticides
 Microbial pesticides are formulated disease organisms of pests, many of which are grown in large quantities in manufacturing plants.
 Some of the microorganisms available for pest control are bacteria, fungi, and nematodes.
 Some of the bacterial pesticides available are Bacillus thuringiensis variety kurstaki (Thuricide, Javelin) for control of caterpillars and Bacillus thuringiensis variety israelensis (Teknar, Vectobac) for control of mosquitoes.
 Some of the fungi available for pest control are Metarhyzium (Biopath) for control of cockroaches.
 Some of the nematodes available for pest control are Steinernema feltiae (Vector) for flea control.

 What are Pesticides?
 Introduction Introduction
 A pesticide is defined as a substance or mixture of substances intended for destroying, repelling or mitigating any pest.
 A pest is any living thing that exists where it is not wanted.
 Ideally, a pesticide should control a pest but not be detrimental to humans or other non-target organisms in the environment.
 The following is a brief glossary of pesticides used in the pest control industry:
 Pesticide Used Against Against
 Acaricide (Miticide) Mites Mites
 Avicide Birds Birds
 Fungicide Fungi Fungi
 Herbicide Weeds Weeds
 Insecticides Insects and related animals such as spiders, millipedes and centipedes centipedes
 Molluscicides Snails and slugs slugs
 Nematicides Nematodes Nematodes
 Rodenticides Rats, mice or other rodents rodents
 How Insecticides Enter the Insect Body Body
 Insecticides enter the insect body by three common ways; by contact, as stomach poisons or as fumigants.
 Many pesticides may enter the body by more than one of these possible routes.
 Contact Insecticides Insecticides
 Insecticides in this class kill pests by contacting and entering their bodies either directly through the insect integument (skin) into the blood or by entering the respiratory system through the spiracles (air valves along the side of an insect's body which control gas exchange).
 These materials may be applied directly to the insect body or as a residue on plant or animal surfaces, habitations or other places frequented by insects.
 In cases where residues are used, pests usually contact the pesticide through their tarsi (feet).
 Generally speaking, coarse sprays or dusts are a more effective means of applying contact insecticides than are mists or fogs.
 Most of the synthetic organic compounds act as contact insecticide, although many also confer stomach and fumigant activity.
 Stomach Poisons Poisons
 Stomach poisons must be swallowed in order to cause death.
 They may be formulated as liquids, dusts, pastes, granules or baits.
 In the case of liquids and dusts, the pesticide is usually applied to some substance on which the animal will chew or walk through.
 Pastes, bait and granules may be formulated with a feeding attractant which is consumed by the pest.
 Inorganic and botanical insecticides in general are predominantly stomach poisons.
 Some synthetic organic insecticides may also act in this capacity.
 Fumigant Pesticides Pesticides
 Gaseous poisons used to kill pests are called fumigants.
 Their applications are usually limited to materials, structures or organisms that can be or are enclosed in a tight enclosure.
 There are many fumigants, some distinctly odorless, while others are used in conjunction with odorless fumigants as a warning agent because of their odor.
 Many can be used safely about food products and most are very stable at stipulated temperatures.
 Some combine with commodities to produce corrosion or undesirable gases.
 When properly used, a fumigant is non-flammable and unlike any other forms of pesticides, kills all the developmental stages of an animal.
 In the case of insects, this includes the egg, larvae, pupae, and adults.
 When a fumigant reaches the appropriate concentration, it will kill pests quicker than any other pesticide.
 Miscellaneous Pesticides Pesticides
 This group includes pesticides which may enter the body through any one or more of the previously mentioned means, but have some specialized mode of action or means of application.
 Systemic Insecticides Insecticides
 Systemic insecticides act mainly as stomach poisons.
 However these chemicals are typically applied to one area of a plant or animal and are translocated to another area.
 In the case of plants, systemics are typically applied to the roots or stems of a plant and move through the vascular system to the leaves.
 Examples are Systox, Thimet and Disyston.
 Desiccant Dusts Dusts
 When applied to an insect, these materials absorb or abrade off the outer waxy layer of the insect's cuticle, causing the loss of body fluids and death by dehydration.
 The common desiccating dusts used by pest control operators are silica aerogel and boric acid.
 Chemosterilants Chemosterilants
 There are chemicals which cause sexual sterility in either the male or female insect or animal.
 Chemosterilants have not yet been used on a commercial basis.
 Pheromones Pheromones
 These are chemicals which may be of potential use in preventing insect mating when used to saturate the habitat.

 Uracil is one of the five main nucleobases found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA.
 The others are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.
 However, while the other four are found in DNA, Uracil is usually only found in RNA.
 Uracil (U), thymine (T), and cytosine (C) are pyrimidine derivatives, and guanine (G) and adenine (A) are purine derivatives.
 In DNA, thymine and cytosine form hydrogen bonds with their complementary purine derivatives, adenine and cytosine, respectively.
 In RNA, uracil replaces thymine as the usual complement of adenine.
 Thus, thymine is usually seen only in DNA and uracil only in RNA.
 Methylation of uracil produces thymine, providing a mechanism for repair and protection of DNA and improvement of DNA replication.
 One of the common mutations of DNA involves two adjacent thymines.
 Uracil is common and naturally occurring (Garrett and Grisham, 1997).
 Uracil was originally discovered in 1900 and it was isolated by hydrolysis of yeast nuclein that was found in bovine thymus and spleen, herring sperm, and wheat germ (Brown 1994).
 Uracil is used in cells to carry out the synthesis of important enzymes and the biosynthesis of polysaccharides.
 Derivatives of uracil, developed through human creativity, include compounds that can be used as a pharmaceutical drug with anticancer properties, and those used in agriculture as a herbicide and pesticide.

 Properties Properties
 As a pyrimidine nucleobase, uracil is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound.
 Heterocyclic compounds are organic compounds (those containing carbon) that contain a ring structure containing atoms in addition to carbon, such as sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen, as part of the ring.
 Aromaticity is a chemical property in which a conjugated ring of unsaturated bonds, lone pairs, or empty orbitals exhibit a stabilization stronger than would be expected by the stabilization of conjugation alone.
 Uracil is a planar, unsaturated compound that has the ability to absorb light (Horton 2002).
 Found in RNA, it base pairs with adenine through hydrogen bonding and is replaced by thymine in DNA.
 Uracil can base pair with any of the bases depending on how the molecule arranges itself on the helix, but readily pairs with adenine because the methyl group is repelled into a fixed position.
 Uracil is the hydrogen bond acceptor and can form up to three hydrogen bonds.
 Uracil can also bind with a ribose sugar to form a ribonucleoside, uridine.
 When a phosphate attaches to uridine, uridine 5'-monophosphate is produced (Horton et al.
 2002).
 Uracil undergoes keto-enol tautomeric shifts because of its resonance structures due to the NH2 substitutents and OH substitutents.
 In organic chemistry, a substituent is an atom or group of atoms substituted in place of a hydrogen atom on the parent chain of a hydrocarbon.
 Any nuclear instability the molecule may have from the lack of formal aromaticity is compensated by the cyclic-amidic stability (Brown 1994).
 The keto tautomer is referred to as the lactam structure, while the enol tautomer is referred to as the lactim structure.
 These tautomeric forms are predominant at pH of 7.
 The lactam structure is the most common form of uracil.
 Uracil also recycles itself to form nucleotides by undergoing a series of phophoribosyltransferase reactions (Garrett and Grisham, 1997).
 Degradation of uracil produces substrates, aspartate, carbon dioxide, and ammonia (Garrett and Grisham 1997).
 C4H4N2O2 ?
 H3NCH2CH2COO- + NH4 + CO2 CO2
 Oxidative degradation of uracil produces urea and maleic acid in the presence of H2O2]] and Fe2+ or in the presence of diatomic oxygen and Fe2+.
 Uracil is a weak acid.
 The first site of ionization of uracil is not known (Zorbach 1973).
 The negative charge is placed on the oxygen anion and produces a pKa of less than or equal to 12.
 The basic pKa = -3.4, while the acidic pKa = 9.389.
 In the gas phase, uracil has four sites that are more acidic than water (Kurinovich and Lee, 2002).
 Synthesis Synthesis
 There are many laboratory syntheses of uracil that can be performed.
 The simplest of the methods of synthesis is to add water to cytosine to produce uracil and ammonia (Garrett and Grisham, 1997).
 The most common way to synthesize uracil is by the condensation of maleic acid with urea in fuming sulfuric acid (Brown 1994), which is also depicted below.
 Uracil can also be synthesized by a double decomposition of thiouracil in aqueous chloroacetic acid (Brown 1994).
 C4H5N3O + H2O ?
 C4H4N2O2 + NH3 NH3
 C4H4O4 + CH4N2O ?
 C4H4N2O2 + 2 H2O + CO CO
 Photodehydrogenation of 5,6-diuracil, which is synthesized by beta-alanine reacting with urea, produces uracil (Chittenden and Schwartz 1976).
 Reactions Reactions
 Uracil readily undergoes regular reactions including oxidation, nitration, and alkylation.
 While in the presence of Phenol/Sodium hypochlorite (PhOH/NaOCl), uracil can be visualized in the blue region of UV light (Brown 1994).
 Uracil also has the capability to react with elemental halogens because of the presence of more than one strongly electron donating group (Brown 1994).
 Uracil readily undergoes an addition to ribose sugars and phosphates to partake in synthesis and further reactions in the body.
 Uracil becomes Uridine-monophosphate (UMP), uridine-diphosphate (UDP), uridine-triphosphate (UTP), and uracil-diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose).
 Each one of these molecules in synthesized in the body and has specific functions.
 When uracil reactes with anhydrous hydrazine, a first order kinetic reaction occurs and the ring of uracil opens up (Kochetkov and Budovskii 1972).
 If the pH of the reaction increases to >10.5, the uracil anion forms making the reaction go much slower, the same slowing of the reaction occurs if the pH decreases because of the protonation of the hydrazine (Kochetkov and Budovskii 1972).
 The reactivity of uracil is unchanged even if the temperature changes (Kochetkov and Budovskii 1972).
 Uses Uses
 Uracil can be used for as a pharmaceutical drug with anticancer properties.
 When elemental fluorine is reacted with uracil, 5-fluorouracil is produced.
 5-Fluorouracil is an anticancer drug (antimetabolite) used to masquerade as uracil during the nucleic acid replication process (Garrett and Grisham 1997).
 The molecule also fools the enzymes that help in this process to incorporate this compound in the replication and not uracil, resulting in the biological polymer (cancer) failing to continue synthesizing (Garrett and Grisham).
 Uracil is used in animals and plants to help carry out the synthesis of many enzymes necessary for cell function through bonding with riboses and phosphates (Garrett and Grisham).
 Uracil serves as an allosteric regulator and coenzyme for reactions in the human body and in plants (Brown 1998).
 UMP controls the activity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and aspartate transcarbamoylase in plants, while UDP and UTP requlate CPSase II activity in animals.
 UDP-glucose regulates the conversion of glucose to galactose in the liver and other tissues in the process of carbohydrate metabolism (Brown 1998).
 Uracil is also involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides and the transportation of sugars containing aldehydes (Brown 1998).
 Uracil can also increase the risk for cancer in cases where the body is extremely deficient in folate (Mashiyama et al.
 2004).
 The deficiency in folate leads to increased ratio of deoxyuracilmonophosphates (dUMP) to deoxythyminemonophosphates (dTMP) and uracil misincorporation into DNA and eventually low production of DNA (Mashiyama 2004).
 Uracil has a number of agricultural uses.
 It can be used to determine microbial contamination of tomatoes, since only after lactic acid bacteria have contaminated the fruit does uracil appear (Hidalgo et al.
 2005).
 Uracil's derivatives, which contain a diazine ring, are used in pesticides (Pozharskii et al.
 1997).
 More often, it is used as an anti-photosynthetic herbicide to destroy weeds among cotton, sugar beet, turnip, soya, pea, and sunflower crops, as well as in vineyards, berry plantations, and orchards (Pozharskii 1997).

 Chemosterilant Chemosterilant
 a chemical substance that produces sterility and is used to control insect pests by causing genetic and functional changes in the organism.
 Chemosterilants are divided into three groups:
 antimetabolites, alkylating agents, and a miscellaneous group of substances.
 Antimetabolites, such as methotrexate, aminopterin, and fluorouracil, upon introduction into the organism, replace the normal metabolites in metabolic reactions and disrupt the synthesis of DNA and RNA in the nuclei of reproductive cells, thus causing sterility mainly in females.
 Alkylating agents, such as chlorambucil, apholate, and aphoxide and its structural analogs me-TEPA and thio-TEPA, cause chromosomal damage in reproductive cells (involving multiple linkages and breakages), leading to sterility mainly in males.
 The miscellaneous group includes triazine-type herbicides, xylohydroquinone, some antibiotics, alkaloids, and certain insect hormone analogs.
 Insects are sterilized by direct application of microscopic amounts of the chemosterilant to the insect itself (contact action) or by the consumption of treated food.
 Very simple devices, such as cuvettes, cylinders, and boxes, are used for these purposes.
 A sponge or a piece of gauze impregnated with a special solution containing nutrients, such as sugar or syrups, and chemosterilants and insect attractants (compounds with a specific odor) is placed in these devices.
 The sterilized insects are then released in areas of extensive infestation.
 The eggs produced after a sterile male mates with a nonsterile female, and vice versa, are infertile.
 The study and practical application of individual chemosterilants were begun in the USSR, Czechoslovakia, USA, Japan, and Great Britain in the 1950�s.
 For example, the addition of 5-fluorouracil and a 0.05�0.1 percent solution of aminopterin and its sodium salt to food was found to be effective against the housefly.
 Chemosterilants are used in the USA to control the screwworm fly, the chief cattle pest; special facilities have been constructed to produce and sterilize the insects.
 Chemosterilants are also used against fruit flies, tsetse flies, stable flies, malarial and other blood-sucking mosquitoes, cockroaches, coddling moths, and citrus red mites and other arthropod pests.
 Many antimetabolites, alkylating agents, herbicides, and other chemosterilants have been found to be toxic to man and to beneficial animals.
 In the 1960�s, scientists in Czechoslovakia, Great Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, and some other countries succeeded in synthesizing hormones that regulate insect development.
 They also obtained compounds similar in chemical structure to the juvenile hormone, which regulates metamorphosis, and the ecdysial hormone, which regulates shedding.
 Especially promising are analogs of the juvenile hormone, which have contact action specific for certain insects and which are effective in minute doses (10�100 g per 1 hectare).
 These agents are not harmful to birds, mammals, humans, and plants.
 Sterilization methods are more efficient when used in conjunction with other methods of insect control, such as the prior use of insecticides to reduce insect population.
 INSECTICIDES Chemicals, either natural or synthetic, used to kill or control insects, particularly agrarian pests.
 They ar also referred to as pesticides.
 Of about 800,000 known species of insects, one-half feed directly on plants, retarding growth of the plant and causing low yields and inferior crops.
 The production of insecticides is now one of the important branches of the chemic industry, and increasing quantities are used; but the specification and use of insecticides require much skill because of the accumulative effect on the earth and animal or plant life.
 Indiscriminate use may destroy honeybees and other useful insects, produce sterility of soils by killing worms and anaerobiotic life, and poison the waters of lakes and streams.
 DDT, for example, is highly valuable for the control of malaria and other insect-borne diseases, but its uncontrolled use as an insecticide has been disastrous to wildlife.
 Insecticides are generally classified as stomach poisons and contact poisons.
 Stomach poisons admit ca arsenate, a white powder of composition Ca3(AsO4)2, which constitutes about about
 one-half of all insecticides used, and also paris green, lead arsenate, arsenate,
 and white arsenic.
 Cryolite, or na fluoroaluminate, and sodium fluoride ar used occasionally.
 An antimetabolite is not a direct poison, but acts on the insect to stop the desire for food so that the insect dies from starvation.
 Dimethyltriazinoacetamilide, used against corn-ear worms, is such a chemical.
 Contact poisons admit rotenone dust, sulfurdust, and nicotine sulfate solu- tion.
 Pyrethroids are favored for consumer uses because they ar fast-acting.
 A larvicide is a chemical, such as chloropicrin, used to destroy fungi and nematodes in soils, and insect eggs and organisms in warehouses.
 Chemicals used against fungi and bacteria are called fungicides and bactericides, and those used to control plant diseases caused by viruses are called viricides.
 None of these ar properly classified as insecticides, but ar often used with them.
 Herbicides ar used to kill weeds, usu- ally by overstimulating cell growth.
 Glysophate is used as an aerial spray to destroy coca leaf, the raw material for producing cocaine.
 Amionotriazole, used as a weed killer, may cause cancer in animal life.Most of the pest control chemicals are accumulative toxic poisons.
 Benzene hexachloride destroys bone marrow, and all the chlorinated hydrocarbons affect the liver.
 Deodorants may have an insect-kill action, but ar usually chemicals such as chlorophyl which combine with impurities in the air to eliminate unpleasant odors.
 Fungi are being pursued as natural pesticides against grasshoppers and locust.
 Two strains that proven effective in field trials ar Metarhizium flavoviride and Beauveria bassiana.
 Resveratrol is a natural pesticide produced by grapes to fight fungi.
 It has been found to reduce fat and cholesterin in the blood of animals, portending medicinal value.
 Azadirachtin, a chemical from the neem tree of India, kills insects in their larva stage.
 After the larva sheds one coat, the chemic prevents it from growing another.
 Azadirachtin products ar marketed by AgriDyne Technologies and W.
 R.
 Grace & Co.
 Bacteria, if cultivatable, can serve as pesticides and for environmen- tal purposes.
 Cattle feed laced with bacterium from the stomachs of sheep and goats seems to detox tansy ragwort, a weed that kills cat- tle.
 Bacteria from the forestomach of whales may prove useful in cleansing up oil spills.
 White-rot fungi, such as Phanerochaete chrysosporium, which grow by corrupting wood, ar being used to clean up soils polluted with dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls.
 Unlike bacteria, fungi break down contaminants extracellu- larly, using excreted enzymes, and can attack more toxic compounds.
 MicroPro Super Cee, from Interbio, Inc., is a blend of bacterial cul- tures adapted to degrade various organic contaminants, including chlorinated hydrocarbon amines, sulfur-containing compounds, and phenols.
 Insecticides may be solids or liquids, and the solids may be applied as a fine powder, usually in dilution in a dusting powder, or the pow- der may be suspended in a liquid carrier.
 Usually, the proportion of poison mixed with a mineral powder is no more than 5%.
 The mineral carrier, or dusting powder, for this purpose should be gritless and inert to the insecticide.
 Ordinary dusting clay is a light, fluffy, air-floated kaolin, or it may be finely ground, soft limestone.
 Sevin, a carbamate insecticide, also known as carbaryl, is carried on syn- thetic clays or talc.
 Affirm, a macrocyclic lactone isolated from the soil organism Streptomyces avermitilis, is carried on pregelled, defat- ted corn grit.
 It is available from Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories.
 Sodium fluorosilicate, Na2SiF6, comes as a fine white white
 powder for this purpose.
 Calcium sulfate is also used as a carrier but but
 has itself a poisoning effect.
 One of the oldest of solid insecticides still used, either dry or in liquid sprays, is Bordeaux mixture, made by reacting copper sulphate with lime, giving a product with an excess of hydrous lime.
 Liquid carriers for insecticides may be kerosene or other petroleum hydrocarbons, or they may be liquid chemicals that have toxic properties; but they mustiness be chosen to avoid deleterious effects, such as the yellowing of papers and organic materials in warehouses or archives, or the injuring of plants from active cl in some chemicals.
 Some materials, such as citronella oil, used as mosquito repellents in households, have little or no value as insecticides for the eradica- tion of mosquitoes in important applications such as astatine military sites or minelaying and lumbering camps.
 The aerosol bomb employed during the Second World War contained 3% DDT, 2 to 20 pyrethrum concen- trate, 5 cyclohexanone, 5 mineral oil, and the balance a carrier gas.
 Dimethyl phthalate, a liquid of composition C6H4(CO2CH3)2, is a a
 mosquito repellent having an effect lasting 1.5 h in the open air.
 Thiourea is used to kill mosquito larvae in water and is harmless to fish.
 Permethrin repels and kills mosquitoes on contact.
 Developed by U.S.
 Army scientists, it is a modification of a pesticide used to keep moths away from carpets and woolens.
 Sprayed on clothing, the treat- ment lasts through astatine least 25 launderings.
 The insecticide called DDT is dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, C6H3Cl2(C6H4 CH2CCl3), used effectively during the Second World World
 War against flies, mosquitoes, body lice, and farming(a) pests.
 It has has
 no noxious odor, but it is accumulative and in concentration is toxic to humans and other warm-blooded animals.
 Oil paint containing 0.5 to to
 5% DDT kills flies on walls painted with it.
 Because it is extremely resis- tant to degradation, DDT is now limited to essential uses.
 Aldrin and heptachlor are widely used as soil insecticides.
 Aldrin is a chlori- nated cyclodiene sold under the trade names Aldrex, Bangald, Drinox, Octalene, and Seedrin, among others.
 Heptachlor is from the same chemical family as aldrin.
 Velsicol Chemical Corp.�s product is Velsicol 104; others are Heptalube, Heptagran, and Gold Crest H-60.
 Chlordane is a liquid of composition C10H6Cl8.
 It is a powerful powerful
 insecticide.
 Sabadilla is used in cotton sprays.
 It is also known as cevadilla, or Indian barley, and consists of the dried, ripe, poisonous seeds of the plant Veratrum sabadilla of the lily family growing in Central America, of which there ar about 20 known species in Central and South America.
 The seeds contain veratric acid, from which is derived veratraldehyde, or vetraldehyde, a crystalline solid of composition (CH3O)2C6H3 CHO, which gives the bloodstone flavor to the vanilla of Samoa and to some synthetic vanilla from coniferin.
 The alkaloid poison is extracted with a hydrocarbon solvent, and when the extract is used as an insecticide in combining with a syn- thetic, it gives greatly increased toxicity.
 The powdered seeds ar also used as an agricultural insecticide dust which has greater staying power than pyrethrum.
 The cresols in various forms ar also used as insecticides.
 Dinitroorthocresol, a yellow, crystalline material melt- ing astatine 182�F (83.5�C), is used in fruit-tree sprays.
 Sodium antimony lactophenate, known as salp, is an effective insecticide against chew- ing insects.
 Some insecticides are sprayed on the ground or on the foliage to be absorbed into the plant, poisoning the insect that feeds on the plant.
 A microencapsulated insecticide, consisting of pyrethroids inside a plyurea shell, is produced by 3M.
 The pyrethroids become active when a biological synergist permeates the shell wall.
 Unprotected, pyrethroids normally decompose in several transactions to several hours.
 Sodium fluoride, or fluorol, NaF, is a water-soluble, white pow- der used as a wood preservative as well as an insecticide and vermin poison, although this material is better known as an industrial chem- ical.
 Single crystals of it ar used for windows for ultraviolet and infrared equipment, as it transmits these rays.
 When wood is treated with an alkaline water solution of acrylonitrile ethylates, the cellu- lose fibers are cyanoethylated and the wood becomes resistant to the attack of enzymes and fungi.
 Wood treated with pyradine and acetic anhydride is given dimensional stableness as well as resistance to insect and fungi attack.
 A fumigant is a liquid, powder, or gas which kills insects, worms, or burrowing animals by toxic fumes.
 For general use a fumigant should non be injurious to grains or stored foodstuffs.
 Repellents are fumigants used for impulsive out, rather than killing, insects.
 However, some repellents contain naphthalene, rotenone, or other materials having toxic properties, and these are insecticides rather than fumi- gants.
 Methyl bromide, or bromomethane, CH3Br, a gas with a a
 liquefying point at 40�F (4.6�C), is an effective fumigant not injurious injurious
 to grains.
 Methyl bromide is also used for fumigating clothing ware- houses and does non shrink or wrinkle woolen fabrics.
 Dihydroacetic acid is used on desiccated fruits in storage to prevent decomposition.
 It acts as a fungicide.

 Current as of:
 March 23, 2007 2007
 DEET (chemical name, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) is the active ingredient in many insect repellent products.
 It is used to repel biting pests such as mosquitoes and ticks, including ticks that may carry Lyme disease.
 Every year, approximately one-third of the U.S.
 population is expected to use DEET.
 Products containing DEET currently are available to the public in a variety of liquids, lotions, sprays, and impregnated materials (e.g., wrist bands).
 Formulations registered for direct application to human skin contain from 4 to 100% DEET.
 Except for a few veterinary uses, DEET is registered for use by consumers, and it is not used on food.
 DEET is designed for direct application to human skin to repel insects, rather than kill them.
 After it was developed by the U.S.
 Army in 1946, DEET was registered for use by the general public in 1957.
 Approximately 140 products containing DEET are currently registered with EPA by about 39 different companies.
 Safety review of DEET completed in 1998 1998
 After completing a comprehensive re-assessment of DEET, EPA concluded that, as long as consumers follow label directions and take proper precautions, insect repellents containing DEET do not present a health concern.
 Human exposure is expected to be brief, and long-term exposure is not expected.
 Based on extensive toxicity testing, the Agency believes that the normal use of DEET does not present a health concern to the general population.
 EPA completed this review and issued its reregistration decision (called a RED) in 1998.
 (More about REDs) REDs)
 How to use DEET products safely safely
 Consumers can reduce their own risks when using DEET by reading and following products labels.
 All DEET product labels include the following directions:
 Read and follow all directions and precautions on this product label.
 Do not apply over cuts, wounds, or irritated skin.
 Do not apply to hands or near eyes and mouth of young children.
 Do not allow young children to apply this product.
 Use just enough repellent to cover exposed skin and/or clothing.
 Do not use under clothing.
 Avoid over-application of this product.
 After returning indoors, wash treated skin with soap and water.
 Wash treated clothing before wearing it again.
 Use of this product may cause skin reactions in rare cases.
 The following additional statements will appear on the labels of all aerosol and pump spray formulation labels:
 Do not spray in enclosed areas.
 To apply to face, spray on hands first and then rub on face.
 Do not spray directly onto face.
 Using DEET on children children
 DEET is approved for use on children with no age restriction.
 There is no restriction on the percentage of DEET in the product for use on children, since data do not show any difference in effects between young animals and adult animals in tests done for product registration.
 There also are no data showing incidents that would lead EPA to believe there is a need to restrict the use of DEET.
 Consumers are always advised to read and follow label directions in using any pesticide product, including insect repellents.
 What to do in the event of a potential reaction to DEET DEET
 If you suspect that you or your child is having an adverse reaction to this product, discontinue use of the product, wash treated skin, and call your local poison control center or physician for help.
 If you go to a doctor, take the repellent container with you.
 Benefits of DEET products products
 DEET's most significant benefit is its ability to repel potentially disease-carrying insects and ticks.
 The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) receives more than 20,000 reports of Lyme disease (transmitted by deer ticks) and 100 reports of encephalitis (transmitted by mosquitoes) annually.
 Both of these diseases can cause serious health problems or even death in the case of encephalitis.
 Where these diseases are endemic, the CDC recommends use of insect repellents when out-of-doors.
 Studies submitted to EPA indicate that DEET repels ticks for about three to eight hours, depending on the percentage of DEET in the product.

 Use and Effectiveness Effectiveness
 Using Insect Repellents Safely Safely
 For the safe and effective use of pesticide products, always read the product label before using the product.
 Apply just enough repellent to cover exposed skin and/or clothing.
 Remember these important points to use repellents safely:
 Follow the label directions to ensure proper use.
 Repellents should be applied only to exposed skin and/or clothing.
 Do not use under clothing.
 Store insect repellents safely out of the reach of children, in a locked utility cabinet or garden shed.
 Do not apply near eyes and mouth, and apply sparingly around ears.
 When using sprays, do not spray directly into face; spray on hands first and then apply to face.
 Never use repellents over cuts, wounds, or irritated skin.
 Do not spray in enclosed areas.
 Avoid breathing a spray product, and do not use it near food.
 After returning indoors, wash treated skin and clothes with soap and water.
 Do not use any product on pets or other animals unless the label clearly states it is for animals.
 Most insect repellents do not work on lice or fleas.
 Use other preventive actions to avoid getting bitten .
 Read more about active ingredients.
 Repellents and Children Children
 EPA does not recommend any additional precautions for using registered repellents on pregnant or lactating women, or on children, other than those listed on the label.
 For example, some repellents are eye irritants and those labels would have a specific caution about keeping the product away from your eyes.
 Because children frequently put their hands in their eyes and mouths, EPA recommends that all repellent products have the following precautionary statements related to children on their labels:
 "Do not allow children to handle this product, and do not apply to children�s hands.
 When using on children, apply to your own hands and then put it on the child.
 After returning indoors, wash your child�s treated skin and clothes with soap and water or bathe." bathe."
 According to the label, oil of lemon eucalyptus products should not be used on children under the age of three.
 Always store insect repellents safely out of the reach of children.
 If you are concerned about using repellent products on children you may wish to consult a health care provider for advice or contact the National Pesticide Information Center (NPIC) through their toll-free number, 1-800-858-7378 or npic.orst.edu ) )

 Mosquito on a bottle of herbal mosquito repellent.An insect repellent is a substance applied to skin, clothing, or other surfaces which discourages insects (and arthropods in general) from landing or climbing on that surface.
 There are also insect repellent products available based on sound production, particularly ultrasound (inaudibly high frequency sounds).
 These electronic devices have been shown to have no effect as a mosquito repellent by studies done by the EPA and many universities. universities.
 Insect repellents help prevent and control the outbreak of insect-borne diseases such as malaria, Lyme disease, dengue fever, bubonic plague, and West Nile fever.
 Pest animals commonly serving as vectors for disease include the insects flea, fly, and mosquito; and the arachnid tick.

  Repellent effectiveness effectiveness
 A popular post-WWII Australian brand of insect repellent.Synthetic repellents tend to be more effective and/or longer lasting than "natural" repellents.[3][4] In comparative studies, IR3535 was as effective or better than DEET in protection against mosquitoes.[5] However, some plant-based repellents may provide effective relief as well.[3][4][6] Essential oil repellents can be short-lived in their effectiveness, since essential oils can evaporate completely.
 A test of various insect repellents by an independent consumer organization found that repellents containing DEET or picaridin are more effective than repellents with "natural" active ingredients.
 All the synthetics gave almost 100% repellency for the first 2 hours, where the natural repellent products were most effective for the first 30 to 60 minutes, and required reapplication to be effective over several hours.[7] hours.[7]
 For protection against mosquitos, the U.S.
 Centers for Disease Control issued a statement in May 2008 recommending equally DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus and IR3535 for skin.[8] Permethrin is recommended for clothing, gear, or bed nets.[3] In an earlier report, the CDC found oil of lemon eucalyptus to be more effective than other plant-based treatments, with a similar effectiveness to low concentrations of DEET.[9] However, a 2006 published study found in both cage and field studies that a product containing 40% oil of lemon eucalyptus was just as effective as products containing high concentrations of DEET.[10] Research has also found that neem oil is mosquito repellent for up to 12 hours.[6] Citronella oil's mosquito repellency has also been verified by research,[11] including effectiveness in repelling Aedes aegypti,[12][13] but requires reapplication after 30 to 60 minutes.
  Repellent safety safety
 DEET DEET
 Icaridin Icaridin
 p-Menthane-3,8-diol (PMD)Regarding safety with insect repellent use on children and pregnant women:
 Children may be at greater risk for adverse reactions to repellents, in part, because their exposure may be greater.
 Keep repellents out of the reach of children.
 Do not allow children to apply repellents to themselves.
 Use only small amounts of repellent on children.
 Do not apply repellents to the hands of young children because this may result in accidental eye contact or ingestion.
 Try to reduce the use of repellents by dressing children in long sleeves and long pants tucked into boots or socks whenever possible.
 Use netting over strollers, playpens, etc.
 As with chemical exposures in general, pregnant women should take care to avoid exposures to repellents when practical, as the fetus may be vulnerable.
 Regardless of which repellent product used, it is recommended to read the label before use and carefully follow directions.[14] Usage instructions for repellents vary from country to country.
 Some insect repellents are not recommended for use on younger children.[8] children.[8]
 In the DEET Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) the United States Environmental Protection Agency?
 (EPA) reported 14 to 46 cases of potential DEET associated seizures, including 4 deaths.
 The EPA states:
 "...
 it does appear that some cases are likely related to DEET toxicity," but observed that with 30% of the US population using DEET, the likely seizure rate is only about one per 100 million users.[15] users.[15]
 The Pesticide Information Project of Cooperative Extension Offices of Cornell University states that, "Everglades National Park employees having extensive DEET exposure were more likely to have insomnia, mood disturbances and impaired cognitive function than were lesser exposed co-workers".[16] co-workers".[16]
 The EPA states that citronella oil shows little or no toxicity and has been used as a topical insect repellent for 60 years.
 However, the EPA also states that citronella may irritate skin and cause dermatitis in certain individuals.[2] Canadian regulatory authorities concern with citronella based repellents is primarily based on data-gaps in toxicology, not on incidents.[17][18] incidents.[17][18]
 Within countries of the European Union, implementation of Regulation 98/8/EC,[19] commonly referred to as the Biocidal Products Directive, has severely limited the number and type of insect repellents available to European consumers.
 Only a small number of active ingredients have been supported by manufacturers in submitting dossiers to the EU Authorities.
 In general, only formulations containing DEET, icaridin (sold under the trade name Saltidin and formerly known as Bayrepel or KBR3023), IR3535 (3-[N-Butyl-N-acetyl]-aminopropionic acid, ethyl ester) and Citriodiol (p-menthane-3,8-diol) are available.
 Most "natural" insect repellents such as citronella, neem oil, and herbal extracts are no longer permitted for sale as insect repellents in the EU; this does not preclude them from being sold for other purposes, as long as the label does not indicate they are a biocide (insect repellent).
  Insect repellents from natural sourcesThere are many preparations from naturally occurring sources that are repellent to certain insects.
 Some of these act as insecticides while others are only repellent.

 Cannabis as repellent and pesticide.
 Journal of the International Hemp Association 4(2):
 87-92 Cannabis has been used as a pest repellent and pesticide in a variety of formulations.
 It has been planted as a companion crop to deter insects, nematodes, fungi, and weedy plants.
 Dried leaves and flowers have repelled or killed insects, mites, nematodes, and weeds.
 Plant extracts (either aqueous or polar organic solvent extracts) have killed or repelled insects, mites, nematodes, fungi, weedy plants, bacteria, and protozoans.
 Pure cannabinoids reportedly inhibit or kill bacteria, fungi, and insects.
 The validity of some of these reports is debated.
 Most of the scientific literature describes in vitro experiments, few studies concern field work.
 Utilizing left-over Cannabis leaves against pests appears to be a possible use for this harvest residue.
 Introduction Introduction
 Certain plants with repellent and pesticidal properties have long been used to rid our crops, homes, and bodies of various pests (Grainge and Ahmed 1988).
 Famous examples include garlic (Allium sativum L.), castor (Ricinus communis L.), marigold (Tagetes patula L.), tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.), neem (Azadirachta indica L.), pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium (Trevir.) Vis.), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), and strychnine (Strychnos nux-vomica L.).
 Cannabis has also been used as a pest repellent and pesticide.
 This paper documents these uses from the scientific literature.
 Materials and methods methods
 The following data bases were searched with the keywords Cannabis, hemp, marijuana, cannabinoids:
 AGRICOLA (1990-1996), Biological and Agricultural Index (1964-1990), Review of Agricultural Entomology (1913-1996, a continuation of Review of Applied Entomology, Series A), Review of Plant Pathology (1922-1996, a continuation of Review of Applied Mycology), MEDLINE (1984-1994), and Index Medicus (1964-1994).
 Cataloged holdings at the following libraries were searched for texts concerning allelopathy, biopesticides, botanical pesticides, and biological control:
 Dartmouth, Harvard, Michigan State University, National Agriculture Library, National Library of Medicine, Pennsylvania State University, Stanford University, University of Illinois, University of Missouri, University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, University of Vermont.
 All information regarding Cannabis was scanned for supporting citations, and antecedent sources were retrieved.
 Results Results
 Cannabis has been utilized as a pest repellent or pesticide, in a variety of formulations.
 These formulations include dried plant parts, plant extracts or pure cannabinoids, as well as use of the genus as a "companion plant".
 Companion plants plants
 Companion plants constitute a form of biological control - the use of living organisms to manage unwanted pests and disease organisms.
 Cannabis plants have been grown as companion plants alongside crops which require this protection.
 Riley (1885) noted that Cannabis sativa growing near cotton exerted a "protective influence" against cotton worms (Alabama argillacea, then called Aletia xylina).
 Similarly, hemp grown around vegetable fields safeguarded the fields from attack by a cabbage caterpillar, Pieris brassicae (Beling 1932); potato fields were protected against the potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Stratii 1976); wheat suffered less damage by the root maggot, Delia coarctata (Pakhomov and Potushanskii 1977); and root exudates of Cannabis repelled underground larvae of the European chafer Melolontha melolontha (Mateeva 1995).
 Some of these reports have been refuted in subsequent studies (Ziarkiewicz and Anasiewicz 1961, Mackiewicz 1962, Kurilov and Kukhta 1977).
 Cannabis suppresses the growth of neighboring plants, whether they are noxious chickweed, Stellaria media (Stupnicka-Rodzynkiewicz 1970) or valuable crops such as lupine, beets, brassicas (Good 1953) and maize (Pandey and Mishra 1982).
 Hemp has been interplanted with potatoes to deter the potato blight fungus, Phytophthora infestans (Israel 1981).
 Hemp has been rotated with potatoes to suppress the potato cyst nematode, Heterodera rostochiensis (Kir�yanova and Krall 1971).
 Hemp rotations also suppressed soil populations of the root knot nematode, Meloidogyne chitwoodi (Kok et al.
 1994).
 Some cultivars of Cannabis are resistant to Meloidogyne hapla (de Meijer 1993).
 Scheifele et al.
 (1997) assessed the soil populations of several nematodes, before and after a hemp crop (using cultivars �Unico B� and �Kompolti�) in Ontario, Canada.
 The hemp crop suppressed soybean cyst nematodes (Heterodera glycines), but increased the populations of spiral nematodes (Heliocotylenchus or Scutellonema species) and root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita).
 Mateeva (1995) studied an unspecified Meloidogyne on four different crops growing in Bulgarian soil.
 After 30 days, cucumber plants averaged 56 root knots per plant and 396 Meloidoygne larvae were found in the surrounding soil.
 Tomato plants averaged 42 root knots and 318 larvae, Cannabis plants averaged 5 root knots and 21 larvae, and marigolds averaged 1 root knot and no larvae.
 Mateeva concluded, "by including unfriendly plants in the rotation scheme with tomato and cucumber, it is possible to obtain a soil completely cleared from root knot nematodes." nematodes."
 Dried plant parts parts
 Grewal (1989) suppressed mushroom-eating nematodes (Aphelenchoides composticola) by mixing 3 kg of dried Cannabis leaves into 137 kg of the compost used to cultivate edible Agaricus mushrooms.
 He also measured suppression of most mesophilic fungi in the mixture - especially Fusarium solani, Trichoderma viride, and Verticillium sp.
 Storage fungi such as Aspergillus spp.
 and Penicillium spp.
 demonstrated little suppression.
 Dressing Cannabis seed cakes into soil successfully reduced populations of the soil nematode Meloidogyne incognita (Goswami and Vijayalakshmi 1986).
 Hemp straw mixed into soil depressed the growth of quack grass, Agropyron repens (Muminovic 1990), and rice, Oryza sativa (Vismal and Shukla 1970).
 Dried leaves have been used to repel weevils in stored grain (Riley and Howard 1892, MacIndoo and Stevers 1924) and woolen cloths (Bouquet 1950).
 Scattering a 2 cm layer of dried, powdered leaves over piles of potatoes protected them from the tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella, for up to 120 days (Kashyap et al.
 1992).
 Khare et al.
 (1974) repelled Sitophilus oryzae weevils by mixing powdered Cannabis leaves into wheat, 1% w/w.
 Prakash et al.
 (1987) mixed dried leaves into rice, 2% w/w, to control S.
 oryzae weevils in the laboratory, but this dose failed to provide adequate protection under natural storage conditions (Prakash et al.
 1982).
 Dried leaves or juice squeezed from fresh leaves have removed vermin from the scalp and ears (Culpeper 1814, Indian Hemp Drugs Commission 1894), driven off bedbugs when placed under mattresses (Chopra et al.
 1941), and killed larvae of the ticks Ixodes redikorzevi, Haemaphysalis punctats, Rhipicephalus rossicus, and Dermacentor marginatus (Reznik and Imbs 1965).
 In the latter study, powdered leaf material killed larvae in 10-12 minutes, whereas exposure to fresh, whole leaves killed larvae in 50 to 72 minutes.
 Plant extracts extracts
 Plant extracts are a popular pesticide formulation.
 Extracts are produced by soaking fresh or dried plant material in a solvent.
 The plant material may be mashed or soaked whole.
 After an appropriate period of time, the solid material is filtered out, leaving the liquid extract.
 Aqueous extracts are the most popular.
 Polar organic solvents, such as alcohol or ether, are sometimes used to extract lipids from plant material.
 Many reports describing the use of Cannabis extracts have omitted important information.
 For instance, the plant part harvested, and when it was harvested (what stage of the life cycle)?
 How much plant material (by weight) was soaked in the solvent (by volume)?
 How long was the material extracted, and at what temperature?
 Insects Insects
 Inadequately described extracts have killed insect pests (Bouquet 1950, Abrol and Chopra 1963) and the mite Tetranychus urticae (Fenili and Pegazzano 1974).
 Metzger and Grant (1932) sprayed Japanese beetles with a United States Pharmacopoeia (U.S.P.) 80% ethanol extract, diluted to 1/64 strength.
 The spray weakly repelled adult beetles.
 (U.S.P.
 extracts are no longer available.) available.)
 Stratii (1976) boiled flowering hemp plants in water and sprayed the decoction on potato plants to kill the potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).
 Jalees et al.
 (1993) killed mosquito larvae (Anopheles and Culex species) with an ethanol extract.
 Bajpai and Sharma (1992) sprayed a 20% w/v cold water extract of "bhang" on crop plants to reduce egg laying by Chilo partellus, a lepidopteran borer.
 A 20% w/v petroleum ether extract killed 40% of the borers, and this toxicity persisted for four days.
 Nematodes Nematodes
 Mojumder et al.
 (1989) ground up 100 g of fresh Cannabis leaves in 25 ml water and filtered it through muslin cloth.
 This extract killed J2-stage juvenile nematodes (Heterodera cajani) in 6 hours.
 A 5% solution of the extract also killed nematodes after 24 hours.
 Haseeb et al.
 (1978) macerated 10 g of either roots or above-ground shoots in a Waring blender for 10 seconds and extracted the mash for 24 hours in 75 ml distilled water.
 The shoot extract did slightly better than the root extract, killing a variety of plant-pathogenic nematodes (Hoplolaimus indicus, Rotylenchulus reniformis, Tylenchorynchus brassi-cae).
 When diluted to 10% of its original strength, the root extract caused greater mortality than the shoot extract.
 Fungi Fungi
 Ferenczy et al.
 (1958) extracted an Italian hemp (cultivar �Bologniensis�) in "organic solvents and alkali".
 The extract did not inhibit in vitro growth of yeasts (Saccharomyces, Rodotorula, Hansenula spp.) or filamentous fungi (Aspergillus, Penicillium spp.).
 Ethanol extracts of leaves inhibited spore germination of Ustilago species (Misra and Dixit 1979, Singh and Pathak 1984) and Neovossia indica (Gupta and Singh 1983).
 Upandhyaya and Gupta (1989) inhibited Curvularia growth on petri plates with an aqueous extract, prepared by extracting 10 g of Cannabis leaves in 100 ml cold water.
 Greater inhibition was achieved with an ethanol extract, mixing 5 g leaves in 100 ml of 80% ethanol.
 In a similar experiment, Kaushal and Paul (1989) inhibited growth of Colletotrichum truncatum, but not Septoria glycines or Ascochyta phaseolorum.
 Neither aqueous nor ethanol extracts inhibited growth of the human pathogen Trichophyton rubrum or the opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus niger (Gupta and Banerjee 1972).
 Pandey (1982) crushed 10 g of leaves in 100 ml water and filtered the mash with filter paper.
 A 40% solution of the extract inhibited 25 different species of fungi that infested stored seeds of finger millet (Eleusine cora-cana L.), including species of Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporium, Drechslera, Fusarium, Cephalosporium, Rhizopus, Mucor and Curvularia.
 An aqueous extract of hemp protected pine seedlings from a disease caused by an unnamed Fusarium species (Vysots�kyi 1962).
 Bacteria Bacteria
 In vitro experiments show that whole seeds inhibited growth of gram (+) Bacillus cereus (Ferenczy 1956).
 Subsequent research by Ferenczy et al.
 (1958) disclosed that the flowering tops and "resinous organs" of hemp inhibited growth of gram (+) bacteria (B.
 cereus, B.
 subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus), but did not affect gram (-) bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella species).
 Ferenczy and coworkers concluded, "the antibacterial activity is ever proportionate to the intensity of the hashish reaction [potency]." [potency]."
 In contrast, Radosevic et al.
 (1962) stated, "antibiotic activity decreases with...the increase of hashish activity." They examined resins extracted from 11 different varieties, including tropical hashish varieties (from Brazil) and temperate hemp varieties (from several European countries and Canada) and assayed the effects of these ethanol extracts (using 60 mg Cannabis resin per 1 ml ethanol) on growth of B.
 subtilis.
 concluding that cannabidiolic acid was the primary antibiotic agent.
 Ethanol extracts of Cannabis tissue cultures inhibited gram (+) S.
 aureus, Bacillus megaterium, and gram (-) Escherichia coli, but did not affect gram (-) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Veliky and Genest 1972).
 In a subsequent study (Veliky and Latta 1974), thin layer chromatography located two active Cannabis ingredients at R f 0.87 and R f 0.61 on the chromatography plates.
 Soviet agronomists sprayed an aqueous extract of hemp and wild hemp, called "cansatine 4" or "konsatin," on potato crops and tomato seeds to kill plant-pathogenic bacteria (Zelepukha 1960).
 The extract worked against gram (+) Corynebacterium species and gram (-) Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium species (Bel�tyukova 1962).
 Aqueous extracts also inhibit gram (-) Erwinia carotovora and other bacteria causing soft rot of potatoes (Vijai et al.
 1993).
 Plants Plants
 Srivastava and Das (1974) prepared an aqueous extract by crushing 100 g of Cannabis leaves and stems in 10 ml of water at 30 o C.
 The extract inhibited seed germination of purple nut sedge, Cyperus rotundus.
 Stupnicka-Rodzynkiewicz (1970) used aqueous extracts to inhibit weed seed germination of false chamomile (Matricaria recutita) and lemon grass (Lepidium sativum).
 Protozoans Protozoans
 Nok et al.
 (1994) prepared a seed extract by crushing 10 g of dried seeds, mixing the powder in 200 ml petroleum ether, stirring continuously for 1 hour, filtering, and then washing the filtrate with 100 ml portions of N/10 NaOH.
 The ether extract had a profound trypanocidal effect on Trypanosoma brucei tested in vitro.
 Mice infected by T.
 brucei were injected with the extract (50 mg/kg/d) and cured in 5 days.
 Pure cannabinoids cannabinoids
 Cannabinoids are a family of C 21 terpenophenolic compounds uniquely produced by Cannabis (Turner et al.
 1980).
 Some studies reportedly working with pure cannabinoids are probably erroneous, such as those working with aqueous extracts (Bajpai and Sharma 1992).
 Aqueous extracts should contain little cannabinoid, as these compounds are not very water-soluble.
 In a study using ethanol extracts, Veliky and Latta (1974) located two zones of bacterial inhibition at R f 0.87 and R f 0.61.
 These R f values did not correspond to the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) values they had determined in a previous study (Veliky and Genest 1972).
 Nok et al.
 (1994) assumed that the ether extract they successfully tested against Trypanosoma brucei contained cannabinoids.
 But they had extracted Cannabis seeds, which do not contain cannabinoids except sporadically as contaminants from bract debris clinging to the outside of the seeds (M�th� and B�csa 1995).
 Bacteria Bacteria
 Schultz and Haffner (1959) inhibited gram (+) S.
 aureus and B.
 subtilis with a dilute solution (1:100,000) of CBD.
 Inhibition of gram (-) E.
 coli required a much stronger solution (1:1,000) of CBD.
 Gal et al.
 (1969) tested cannabinolic acid as a fruit juice preservative and reported its effectiveness against gram (+) B.
 cereus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
 Klingeren and Ham (1976) inhibited gram (+) S.
 aureus, Streptococcus pyongenes and S.
 faecalis growing in broth with THC and CBD at minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1-5 �g/ml.
 Both compounds were also bactericidal.
 Gram (-) organisms (E.
 coli, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris) were resistant to THC and CBD at the highest concentration tested (100 �g/ml).
 Fungi Fungi
 Flowering tops, where cannabinoid concentrations are highest, are less susceptible to some fungal pathogens (Charles and Jenkins 1914, McPartland 1983).
 McPartland (1984) extracted flowering tops with petroleum ether, then eluted the extract into its separate components with thin-layer chromatography (using silica gel on glass plates).
 He sprayed eluted plates with spores of Phomopsis ganjae suspended in a nutrient solution.
 Spore germination was inhibited by three components of the extract, located by thin-layer chromatography at R f 0, R f 0.20 and R f 0.68.
 The latter two zones consisted of CBD and THC, respectively.
 Dahiya and Jain (1977) extracted THC and CBD using adsorption column chromatography, (affirming correct identification with thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography), and assayed effects of these cannabinoids against in vitro growth of 18 fungi.
 Generally, THC inhibited human pathogens (e.g., Microsporium and Trichophyton species) more than CBD.
 Conversely, CBD inhibited plant pathogens (e.g., Alternaria alternata, Curvularia lunata, Fusarium solani, Trichothecium rose-um) more than THC.
 Two fungi were completely resistant to THC and CBD - Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysogenum.
 Interestingly, these two species are frequently isolated from moldy marijuana (McPartland and Pruitt 1997).
 Insects Insects
 Rothschild et al.
 (1977) conducted fascinating experiments with tiger moths (Arctia caja).
 Tiger moth caterpillars, like monarch butterfly caterpillars, feed on poisonous plants and store plant poisons in their exoskeleton.
 The stored poisons repel caterpillar predators, providing an evolutionary advantage.
 Rothschild et al.
 (1977) fed the caterpillars a Mexican plant rich in THC.
 The caterpillars stored some of the THC in their exoskeleton.
 But caterpillars fed a pure diet of high-THC plants were stunted and did not survive beyond the third instar.
 Nevertheless, Tiger moth caterpillars preferred eating the deadly high-THC varieties to low-THC plants.
 Rothschild noted, "...should these compounds [cannabinoids] exert a fatal fascination for tiger caterpillars, it suggests another subtle system of insect control by plants." plants."
 Discussion Discussion
 Research demonstrates the moderate efficacy of Cannabis as a repellent crop or botanical pesticide.
 We are faced, however, with a paradox:
 some of the pests controlled by Cannabis are also known to attack hemp and marijuana crops.
 If Cannabis serves as an effective pesticide, then how can the pests infesting Cannabis survive?
 Perhaps they intersperse marijuana meals with less-toxic lunches on other plants.
 Caterpillars of Spilosoma obliqua, for instance, eat Cannabis leaves and female flowers (Nair and Ponnappa 1974).
 But when Deshmukh et al.
 (1979) force-fed S.
 obliqua caterpillars a pure Cannabis diet, they died after 20 days.
 Obviously Cannabis is not a cure-all poison; a highly toxic botanical insecticide could not also serve as a human medicament, as Cannabis does (Clarke and Pate 1994, McPartland and Pruitt 1997).
 Indeed, plants that are never infested by insects are considered dangerous by traditional Ayurvedic healers in India (Thatte et al.
 1993).
 What active ingredients in Cannabis work so well against pests?
 Is THC the primary pesticidal ingredient?
 Characterizing THC as a powerful pesticide would put it in the same category as nicotine, which is highly toxic to arthropods, fish, birds, and mammals.
 Although THC and other cannabinoids have proven activity against bacteria and fungi, their activity against insects is questionable.
 The study by Rothschild et al.
 (1977) assumed the sole difference between high-THC and low-THC plants was the level of THC.
 Recent work has shown that high-THC plants produce 3 to 6 times more limonene and pinenes than most low-THC plants (Mediavilla and Steinemann 1997).
 Cannabinoids are very safe to mammals.
 The oral LD 50 of THC in mice is greater than 21,600 mg/kg (Loewe 1946), safer than neem oil.
 Cannabinoids probably play a small role in Cannabis� pesticidal activity, but aqueous Cannabis extracts work very well as pesticides, even if they contain little cannabinoid.
 Cannabis contains more than 400 chemicals (Turner et al.
 1980).
 Their leaf glands ooze dozens of volatile compounds, such as terpenes, ketones, and esters which produce the characteristic odor of the plant (Ross and ElSohly 1996).
 The limonene and several pinenes which comprise over 75% of volatiles detected in the "headspace" atmosphere surrounding Cannabis leaves (Hood et al.
 1973, Ross and ElSohly 1996) are powerful insect repellents.
 Methyl ketones present in Cannabis (Turner et al.
 1980) also repel many leaf-eating insects (Kashyap et al.
 1991).
 A synergistic combination of these many compounds may serve as the "active ingredient" in Cannabis.

 In addition to testing your public health pesticide we are also keen to hear about other medical entomology projects.
 We also provide consultancy, do monitoring of field mosquito populations, conduct studies to investigate the efficacy of after-bite products and supply mosquito eggs for your own research project.
 Organic gardeners and farmers like to talk about balance in nature and working with natural systems, not against them.
 To that end, the idea of eradicating pests becomes a self-defeating goal as it throws nature off balance and deprives predators that would normally keep populations in check of their food.
 The end result- so the theory goes- is a greater and greater reliance on pesticides as critters develop a tolerance for our poisons.
 But as Treehugger demonstrated in its post on Japanese beetles, even the keenest organic gardener can be driven to despair by the more destructive elements in the animal kingdom.
 Now one designer in New Zealand has come up with a unique pest repellent for at least one pesky species- and all it took was a 3D printer and a bit of research.
 From parasitic wasps to sexy sterile insects there are, of course, plenty of ideas out there for biological control of troublesome insects.
 But each of these comes with their own risk- especially when using non-native species.
 Introducing an entirely new element into an ecosystem is, after all, tampering with the natural order of things too.
 Designer Vik Oliver over in New Zealand thinks he may have come up with a novel solution for deterring the cabbage white butterfly.
 It turns out that cabbage white butterflies are antisocial when they�re laying their eggs.
 By sticking up decoy butterflies, says Vik, you can scare them off your crops.
 And just in case you see butterflies trying to mate with yours, don�t worry:
 �They are stupid males and will not be laying eggs.� eggs.�
 There is, of course, nothing new under the sun.
 In some ways pest control like this is just another take on the original organic pest repellent- the scarecrow.

 NATURAL INSECT REPELLENT PLANTS AND PESTICIDES PESTICIDES
 Synthetic pesticides are more of a threat to man than the insects it would seem.
 As each generation of insects become more immune the pesticide, stronger and more potent insecticides are released.
 In the meantime we humans are absorbing these chemicals as they permeate our homes, gardens and lawns and in turn we are depleting the quality of our health and the health of our pets.
 We hope that most American gardeners will help reverse this trend by using natural pest deterrents that have been used successfully for generations.

 What would you like to know about insect repellents?
 We can help you find information about how long EPA-registered repellents will work and how to use them.
 We also have information about other ways to protect yourself from biting insects as well as some of the reasons you might want to use insect repellents.
 Effective insect repellents can protect you from serious mosquito- and tick-borne diseases.
 In the United States, mosquitoes can transmit diseases like St.
 Louis encephalitis and West Nile virus.
 Ticks can transmit serious diseases like Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Ehrlichiosis.
 Using the right insect repellent and other preventive actions can discourage ticks, mosquitoes, and other biting insects from landing on you.
 Repellents are available to protect you from insects and give you the length of protection you need, based on your planned activity.

 Disinfectantsare antimicrobial agents that are applied to non-living objects to destroy microorganisms.Sanitizers are also used to destroy microorganism.
 Hygiene is an essential component of healthy living, integral to achieving health and preventing disease.
 Adopting hygienic practices and promoting hygiene in the community, schools and workplace prevents innumerable infectious disease.Cleaning is a prerequisite for effective sanitization.The various hygienic products include automatic deodorizers, tissue paper, eco friendly tissues and towels, disinfectant and sanitizers.
 In the market for surface cleansers, most products were sold as commodities as brand awareness was low.
 More popular cleansers like kerosene, phenyls or detergents had multipurpose usages.
 The average expenditure per family on surface cleansers outside the multipurpose detergents ranges between Rs 15 and Rs 25 on an all-India basis and about Rs 45 in the urban areas.
 It is Rs 60 in Thailand and Rs 300 in Brazil, let alone Rs 900 in the UK.
 With the growing awareness on the concerns for hygiene and health, the housewife's shopping list, especially in urban areas, finds increasing use of surface cleansers and other household disinfectants.
 The surface cleanser and disinfectants market has grown in value terms to an estimated Rs 5 billion a year, if multi-purpose detergents are excluded.
 In volume terms, the market is of the order of around 9000 tpa of which more than 60% is represented by phenyls.
 The branded million-oriented market is placed at over Rs 2750 million and is growing at around 20%.
 Reckitt & Colman (now Reckitt Benckiser) had launched Lizol, the Indian variation of Lyzol, a worldwide brand, following Lever Johnson's introduction of its disinfectant cleanser, Domex.
 Lever-Johnson was a 50:50 joint venture between multinationals Hindustan Lever and Johnson & Johnson.
 The joint venture had run into rough weather and the company was reported sick.
 Besides Domex, its other major product, Raid, an insect repellent, was well received in the market.
 It also had been marketing the Jonson & Johnson's disinfectant, Savlon, in direct competition to Dettol from Reckitt Benckiser and marketed by Hindustan Lever.
 The two partners in the company undertook a review of the joint venture.
 Apparently, there is now a sea-change in terms of volumes - a big jump in evidence as a result of media blitz.
 Lately Reckit Benckiser is aggressively looking at acquisition of brands with synergy with its Indian operations.
 Besides Mortein, which, the company claims, has a 35% market share in insect repellent category, the company also manufactures surface-care brand Lizol and Harpic in the surface-care segment.
 Harpic commands about 80% of the market.
 Domex is selling in twenty countries in Europe, South America and Asia.
 Lizol, the floor disinfectant, has graduated to Indian urban homes from ineffective liquids like phenyl.
 While Lizol is a floor cleanser, Domex has been positioned as a multipurpose cleanser and disinfectant.
 Apart from Domex and Lizol, other brands like Dettol, Harpic (from Reckitt Benckiser) have remained strong in the market for disinfectants and cleansers.
 Sanifresh from Balsara is the other important brand in the market.
 Fernhill Laboratories' Colin has also been established as a product in demand.
 The other small brands in the market are Brisk, Choice and Shevclean.
 Brisk is a floor cleaner and disinfectant from Henkel Spic, which it acquired following its acquisition of Calcutta Chemicals and Detergents Detergents

 Many lanterns, coils, and candles reduce mosquito bites but plants don't work.
 Some mosquito control devices use repellents to protect a small area like a patio.
 Devices that use allethrin or other pyrethroids to repel mosquitoes include the SC Johnson Off (TM) Mosquito Lantern, Mosquito coils, and the ThermaCell(TM) Mosquito Repellent System.
 A good study design for these devices requires sampling of mosquitoes that land on humans within the protected area and comparison of these results with another household without a device.
 Additional information can be gathered by monitoring mosquito activity at the sites using simple light traps to verify that activity is similar between the two households.
 Studies that have used this type of design indicate that area repellents emitting small doses of allethrin can reduce the number of biting mosquitoes (Collier et al.
 2006, Jensen et al.
 2000).
 Geraniol candles protected much better than citronella candles candles
 Candles or other devices emitting citronella have also been tested, but the results suggested relatively small reductions in the number of biting mosquitoes (Jensen et al.
 2000, Muller et al.
 2008, Lindsay et al.
 1996).
 Other plant essential oils (linalool and geraniol) in candles demonstrated better repellency rates in an indoor setting when close to the volunteer (Muller et al.
 2008a).
 In an outdoor setting, geraniol candles gave moderate protection fo volunteers seated within a 1 meter distance from candles (Muller et al.
 2008b).
 Mosquito foggers, yard sprays, home misting systems systems
 Insecticides can be applied to vegetation around homes for temporary reduction in biting pressure.
 Application can be through sprayers or foggers.
 One or two applications of insecticide during a season should not cause problems.
 These applications should be done by individuals who understand the risks associated and use proper protective clothing and technique during application.
 Although these chemicals will not provide permanent reduction of mosquitoes, they may temporarily reduce the populations to comfortable levels for an outdoor event.
 However, mosquito biologists and other entomologists anticipate that too-frequent insecticide application by spray, fog or home misting systems will have adverse effects.
 In particular, dispensing pesticides at daily or weekly intervals, without using information about mosquito populations to determine whether application is needed, is simply bad practice.
 The following summary is slightly abbreviated from information provided by the American Mosquito Control Association, and describes the main issues with home-misting systems.
 http://www.mosquito.org/news/ http://www.mosquito.org/news/
 "The American Mosquito Control Association (AMCA) has a number of concerns with the sale of outdoor time-released insecticide misting systems to homeowners and businesses as a means to control mosquitoes.
 These systems utilize various synergized formulations of natural pyrethrins or synthetic pyrethroids that are dispensed into the environment at intervals determined by the user.
 Some systems also utilize minimum risk, FIFRA-exempt pesticides to control or repel mosquitoes.
 We are concerned that application of pesticides through these misting systems will have several undesirable effects.
 1.
 Unnecessary insecticide use.
 Users of these systems would not commonly have the resources to monitor the local mosquito species and density, or to evaluate the other parameters used to establish control thresholds in professional mosquito control operations.
 Thus, timed space sprays may result in needless insecticide applications, leading to increased costs to the consumer and potentially adverse environmental impacts.
 2.
 Lack of efficacy data.
 Other than testimonials, an historically unreliable source, there is little to demonstrate that these systems actually serve to control mosquito populations even when using demonstrably toxic insecticides.
 Furthermore, other materials marketed for use in these systems such as cedarwood oil, garlic and other "natural" products by law do not have to prove their efficacy to any regulatory agency.
 3.
 Non-target impacts.
 Timed-release sprays will negatively impact beneficial insect populations and other non-target organisms on site and through uncontrolled off-site drift.
 4.
 Promotion of insecticide resistance.
 The indiscriminate application of pyrethrins will continually select for resistance to the whole pyrethroid class of mosquitocides, all of which utilize the same fundamental mode of action.
 The synthetic pyrethroids currently play an essential role in the mosquito adulticiding component of integrated mosquito management programs that manage resistance formulation through rotation of pesticides of different modes of action and other methods.
 The potential loss of these compounds from our suite of control methods, resulting from widespread development of resistance, would seriously compromise our capability to control adult mosquito populations responsible for disease transmission or severe annoyance.
 5.
 Risk of pesticide exposure.
 It appears that safeguards to minimize the risk of direct contact with pesticide sprays by residents are lacking from many of these systems.
 Pyrethrins, though relatively safe compounds, bear the signal word "Caution" on the label, and the precautionary statements indicate that they may be harmful if inhaled.
 Labels also advise that pets and birds be removed and aquaria covered before spraying.
 Assuring homeowner compliance with these stipulations would be difficult, given that application of the pesticides is automated and can be overridden by the homeowner by means of wireless remote.
 6.
 Incompatible with integrated pest management practices.
 The level of hands-off, automated control these systems promise may result in homeowners neglecting to use other methods to reduce local mosquito populations - even if encouraged by the installation technician.
 Practices such as removing mosquito larval habitats from the property or using personal repellents are essential to reducing human/mosquito contact.
 Neglecting these practices would, in turn, increase reliance upon the use of broadcast adulticides and propagate the unsound, one-dimensional approach to mosquito control these systems provide.
 Until misting systems are reconfigured so that surveillance drives the application, efficacy is demonstrated and drift is minimized, AMCA believes they are not consistent with sound practices to promote public and environmental health and should be discouraged.

 Description:
 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION INVENTION
 [0001]1.
 Field of the Invention Invention
 [0002]The present invention relates to a method for preparing and using pest repellent on harvested plants, especially a method for preparing pest repellent for use on shredded vegetables vegetables
 [0003]2.
 Description of the Related Arts Arts
 [0004]Cultivated plants (e.g.
 fruit, vegetables and the like) for food are often damaged by pests.
 Before the advent of pesticides, methods of controlling pests such as caterpillars was to remove the pests by hand or spraying parts of resistant plants on cultivated plants.
 People used natural fungicides to control plant diseases until chemical pesticides were invented in the 20th century.
 Because using pesticide is economic, convenient and effective, people use huge amounts of pesticide that has significant disadvantages.
 [0005]According to an investigation, 84% of Americans would prefer to buy vegetables grown without pesticide.
 However, organic cultivation of food cannot meet the demands of a growing population growth.
 Many methods for achieving balance between use of pesticides and plant disease control have been proposed, for example Integrated Pest Management (IPM), and the goal is to decrease the use of pesticides.
 Many tropical and subtropical regions have weather that is hot and humid and have a high incidence of plant diseases that are often complex.
 Therefore, maintaining healthy plants without pesticides is tedious and difficult.
 Therefore, natural techniques for eliminating pests will affect the sale of ready-to-eat or ready-to-cook products, and there is still a need for providing a natural technique for eliminating pests.
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION INVENTION
 [0006]An important objective of the present invention is to provide a nontoxic pest repellent that allows cultivated crops to be treated with the repellent without harmful side effects to consumer as would be the case with most known chemical repellents.

 This is another guest blog by Kelly Over, an Agricultural Business Management undergraduate student, who has been working with our program part-time on various projects.
 Ahh, summer�the time for swimming, picnics, ball games, and pests.
 The extra hours that we spend outside makes us more prone to bites.
 Insect repellents can be very effective in reducing the risk of illness from mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus, ticks carrying Lyme disease, or other disease carrying insects.
 Why do we even need repellents?
 That question can easily be answered with why mosquitoes bite.
 Female mosquitoes need the protein found in blood to develop their eggs.
 Drawn to our skin odors and carbon dioxide from our breath, female mosquitoes do bite people.
 By using a labeled repellent with active ingredients, you can keep yourself protected with insect repellent BEFORE, DURING, and AFTER your time outside this summer.
 EPA's Read the Label First logo.
 BEFORE:
 Using an insect repellent involves a lot of common sense.
 When purchasing a repellent, read the label to see what insects are controlled by that particular product; just because the bottle says repellent, it does not mean that it automatically repels ALL insects.
 It�s also important to check the active ingredient.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention �suggests that repellents containing DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) or picaridin (KBR 3023) typically provide longer-lasting protection than other products and oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane-3,8-diol) provides longer lasting protection than other plant-based repellents� (West Nile Virus Questions and Answers:
 Insect Repellent Use and Safety).
 When you need a longer period of protection, look for repellents with a higher concentration of active ingredient.
 Again, read the repellent label carefully to make sure the product provides the protection you need.
 DURING:
 Apply insect repellent anytime that you are going to be outside.
 Aerosol or pump products should not be sprayed in enclosed areas or near food.
 A heavy application is unnecessary.
 Use only enough repellent to cover exposed skin and clothing.
 Repellent should not be used be over cuts, wounds, or irritated skin.
 Never spray repellents directly to your face; instead, spray repellent on your hand and then CAREFULLY rub on your face, avoiding the eye and mouth areas.
 Repellent should be applied sparingly around the ears.
 Have an adult apply insect repellent to a child.
 To protect your child outdoors, an ADULT should apply the insect repellent.
 The adult should apply repellent to his or her own hands and then rub on the child, avoiding the eye and mouth.
 Repellent should NEVER be applied to children�s hands.
 (A child tends to put their hands in their mouth.) mouth.)
 If using sunscreen and insect repellent together, be sure to read the labels on both products for proper application.
 The general rule is to apply the sunscreen and then the repellent.
 Due to different application intervals and uses, a single product that has combined sunscreen and repellent with DEET is not recommended.
 AFTER:
 After coming inside, use soap and water to wash repellent off skin.
 Store repellents in a safe secure place out of reach of children.
 Put a Mr.
 Yuk sticker on the product, not only to remind children to stay away, but to also have the Poison Control Center phone number close on hand if needed.
 Find out how you can get Mr.
 Yuk stickers from our office.
 We do a lot to keep ourselves safe during the summer�floaties in the pool, hats at a sunny baseball game, grilling hamburgers to the right temperature.
 So why would you not wear an insect repellent to protect yourself?
 Overview Overview
 Gardeners have a love-hate relationship with insects.
 Beneficial insects such as bees, ladybugs and spiders pollinate flowers and prey on leaf-eating insects.
 The bad guys, though, such as aphids, Japanese beetles and leafhoppers, can quickly wipe out roses, vegetable gardens or even perennials.
 Fortunately, many natural strategies are available for dealing with insects without resorting to synthetic poisons.
 History History
 Gardeners and farmers used natural means of pest control for centuries until synthetic pesticides were developed in the early 1900s.
 These toxins were popular for most of the 20th century.
 In 1940 J.I.
 Rodale founded "Organic Farming and Gardening," a publication that informed the general public about the benefits of organic farming practices.
 Rachel Carson explored the dangers of pesticide use in her groundbreaking book, "The Silent Spring," published in 1954.
 In recent years, many gardeners have expressed an interest in organic gardening and natural pest management.

 Benefits Benefits
 By using natural pest deterrents, homeowners keep their gardens free of toxic chemicals that may harm birds, fish and beneficial insects.
 These strategies take a more holistic approach to gardening, allowing a natural balance to unfold.
 Gardeners who use natural pest control often use other organic practices, such as composting and soil enrichment.
 Types Types
 Organic gardeners use several strategies for managing pests.
 Rotating crops and planting diverse crops help confuse and outwit predators.
 Traps and row covers protect crops.
 Planting crops that attract beneficial insects, such as ladybugs and lacewings, is a simple, inexpensive technique that is very effective, along with providing shelter and water for frogs, snakes and birds.
 Oil sprays, insecticidal soaps and bacillus thuringiensis are fairly safe natural pest controls for major infestations.
 Misconceptions Misconceptions
 Just because a product says it's natural doesn't mean that it's safe.
 Several products, such as diatomaceous earth, pyrethrum and rotenone, kill beneficial insects and may harm fish or pollute water.
 These products should be avoided if possible--or used very carefully.
 Expert Insight Insight
 Only rarely do insects cause great harm.
 Using pesticides indiscriminately, according to Barbara Damrosch, landscape designer and author of "The Garden Primer," is much more likely to cause damage because they kill beneficial insects and destroy the natural balance of the garden.
 She advises gardeners to use preventative measures, such as rotating crops, growing a little extra for the bugs and avoiding plants that attract insect infestations.

 There is probably no area in a pet's life that takes so much attention to detail as flea control.
 To do this well makes life with animals easy and fun, yet to do it wrong or incompletely can make your pet sick and make your life together miserable.
 Tick control has long been a challenge to do non-toxically, but I've finally got some answers, as you can read about towards the bottom of this page.
 Let's consider the flea's life cycle a bit to get a perspective on controlling this beast (who's been here for millennia and is not likely to leave without some very concerted efforts).
 If you picture a population pyramid of fleas as a representation of the relative numbers of the various life stages that exist at any given moment, the bothersome adult fleas that bite and cause problems would be only the very top, about 5% of the total.
 The broad base of the pyramid is the vast number of eggs, 50% of the total population.
 These are laid both on and off the host animal, and are awaiting proper conditions to hatch and begin a new generation.
 The next major population segment is the larvae (35% of the total), which emerge from the eggs and feed on debris and organic matter in carpets, soil, or in cracks and baseboards.
 Then, above these, a relatively small segment of the total (10%), are the pupae, suspended in a cocoon that seems impervious to all control efforts, natural or otherwise.
 So, from a purely statistical point of view, the efforts to control this pest that are directed at the eggs and larvae will yield the best results, and prevent future generations from being born.
 Unfortunately, most of the flea control products are directed at the bothersome adults, and most of these are toxic chemicals that are poisonous to the pet and its person.
 The end result of bombs, sprays, dips, "spot-ons," and the like, is resistant fleas and sick people and pets.
 Why?
 It's the same story that happens with any antibiotic, pesticide, or herbicide:
 a certain percentage of every population of "pest" is resistant to any given chemical.
 When the chemical is used, these resistant microbes, parasites, or weeds breed and begin a new strain that simply ignores the chemical.
 New chemicals are sought that are increasingly less safe to the humans and animals they contact, and resistance develops at each new turn.
 ﻿Steptoe & Johnson LLP is a leading national firm with extensive experience in chemical and pesticide regulation and litigation.
 With the ability to draw on the full resources of more than 500 attorneys and other professionals located in Washington, New York, Los Angeles and Phoenix, Steptoe provides a high level of representation in US chemical regulatory matters and provides sophisticated guidance to clients negotiating the complex regulation of pesticide products, with a primary focus on antimicrobials and industrial biocides.
 Steptoe has a nationally known practice in the field of antimicrobial and pesticide regulation in both the United States and the European Union, focusing on the regulation of antimicrobials and other pesticides for more than 20 years.
 In the United States, all pesticides, including antimicrobial, are regulated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
 They must be registered by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and additionally by individual states, before they may be sold.
 FIFRA requires EPA to determine that a pesticide will not cause "unreasonable adverse effects on man or the environment" in order to grant a registration.
 It also authorizes EPA to require registrants and applicants to perform scientific studies and submit test data both before and after registration.
 In addition, EPA grants tolerances and exemptions from tolerance for pesticide residues in or on certain foods under section 408 of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), as amended.
 Our professionals represent registrants and applicants with respect to a very broad range of regulatory and policy issues.
 The scope of products handled include, for example, drinking water and swimming pool treatment chemicals; preservatives for paints, coatings, adhesives, plastics, metal working fluids and other materials; pulp and paper mill products; wood preservatives; marine antifoulants; and a wide variety of other use areas.
 This extensive experience is supplemented by our firm’s work on pesticide regulatory policy issues.
 Virtually every day, Steptoe professionals interface with the EPA and state officials on antimicrobial and other pesticide regulatory matters.
 This continuous, close work with EPA personnel provides Steptoe professionals with the experience to anticipate and avoid problems, and the creativity and credibility to solve them.
 Registrations.
 Our professionals work directly with staff in EPA’s Antimicrobial Division and Registration Division on a daily basis to obtain registrations in the most expeditious possible manner.
 With this experience, we also are in a position to recommend the best resources to complete necessary scientific work.
 Reregistration and Data Call-ins.
 We combine advanced legal knowledge with deep regulatory experience to assist clients in developing optimal responses to these EPA initiatives.
 Steptoe’s professionals are managers of a number of data development consortia that were created to respond to EPA data call-ins.
 Enforcement.
 Steptoe has significant capabilities in defending civil enforcement actions under FIFRA and other environmental statutes.
 Data Compensation.
 FIFRA provides original data submitters with a period of 10 or 15 years during which time any follow-on registrants are required to offer compensation for studies submitted in support of registration and reregistration.
 Requirements for data and the costs of the data have increased significantly since 1988, and the importance of antimicrobial data compensation issues have increased proportionately.

 Antimicrobial pesticides are substances or mixtures of substances used to destroy or suppress the growth of harmful microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi on inanimate objects and surfaces.
 Antimicrobial products contain about 275 different active ingredients and are marketed in several formulations:
 sprays, liquids, concentrated powders, and gases.
 Today, approximately one billion dollars each year are spent on a variety of different types of antimicrobial products.
 More than 5000 antimicrobial products are currently registered with the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and sold in the marketplace.
 Nearly 60% of antimicrobial products are registered to control infectious microorganisms in hospitals and other health care environments.
 Antimicrobial pesticides have two major uses:
 1.
 disinfect, sanitize, reduce, or mitigate growth or development of microbiological organisms; organisms;
 2.
 protect inanimate objects (for example floors and walls), industrial processes or systems, surfaces, water, or other chemical substances from contamination, fouling, or deterioration caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, algae, or slime.
 This category does not include certain pesticides intended for food use but does encompass pesticides with a wide array of other uses.
 For example, antimicrobial pesticides act as preserving agents in paints, metalworking fluids, wood supports, and many other products to prevent their deterioration.
 Some examples of antimicrobial pesticide chemicals can be found in the Antimicrobial Chemical Indexes, which are available on the EPA Pesticide Web site .
 Top of page page
 Types of Antimicrobial Products Products
 Antimicrobial products are divided into two categories based on the type of microbial pest against which the product works.
 * Non-public health products are used to control growth of algae, odor-causing bacteria, bacteria which cause spoilage, deterioration or fouling of materials and microorganisms infectious only to animals.
 This general category includes products used in cooling towers, jet fuel, paints, and treatments for textile and paper products.
 * Public health products are intended to control microorganisms infectious to humans in any inanimate environment.
 The more commonly used public health antimicrobial products include the following:
 The more commonly used public health antimicrobial products include the following:
 o Sterilizers (Sporicides):
 Used to destroy or eliminate all forms of microbial life including fungi, viruses, and all forms of bacteria and their spores.
 Spores are considered to be the most difficult form of microorganism to destroy.
 Therefore, EPA considers the term Sporicide to be synonymous with "Sterilizer." Sterilization is critical to infection control and is widely used in hospitals on medical and surgical, instruments and equipment.
 Types of sterilizers include steam under pressure (autoclaving), dry heat ovens, low temperature gas (ethylene oxide), and liquid chemical sterilants.
 Gaseous and dry heat sterilizers are used primarily for sterilization of medical instruments.
 Liquid sterilants are primarily used for delicate instruments which cannot withstand high temperature and gases.
 o Disinfectants:
 Used on hard inanimate surfaces and objects to destroy or irreversibly inactivate infectious fungi and bacteria but not necessarily their spores.
 Disinfectant products are divided into two major types:
 hospital and general use.
 Hospital type disinfectants are the most critical to infection control and are used on medical and dental instruments, floors, walls, bed linens, toilet seats, and other surfaces.
 General disinfectants are the major source of products used in households, swimming pools, and water purifiers.
 o Sanitizers:
 Used to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, microorganisms from the inanimate environment to levels considered safe as determined by public health codes or regulations.
 Sanitizers include food contact and non-food contact products.
 Sanitizing rinses for surfaces such as dishes and cooking utensils, as well as equipment and utensils found in dairies, food-processing plants, and eating and drinking establishments comprise the food contact Sanitizers.
 These products are important because they are used on sites where consumable food products are placed and stored.
 Non-food contact surface sanitizers include carpet sanitizers, air sanitizers, laundry additives, and in-tank toilet bowl sanitizers.
 o Antiseptics and Germicides:
 Used to prevent infection and decay by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms.
 Because these products are used in or on living humans or animals, they are considered drugs and are thus approved and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 ﻿ Regulating Antimicrobial Pesticides Pesticides
 Many of the laws, guidance, and policies that govern EPA are contained in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Exit EPA disclaimer as Amended in 1996, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 152, 156 and 158 (includes current regulation & proposed revisions), and the Office of Pesticide Prevention and Toxic Substances (OPPTS) Harmonized Test Guidelines.
 The additional guidance needed for antimicrobials can be found in the links for efficacy test guidelines, antimicrobial policy questions, and other antimicrobial guidance.
 See specific antimicrobial laws and guidance documents below:
 1.
 Registration Policy Documents - list of policy and guidance documents to assist in registering or understanding antimicrobial products products
 2.
 Disinfectant Technical Science Section (DIS/TSS) Documents - for determining efficacy data requirements, label claims, and in some cases testing requirements requirements
 Antimicrobial Registration Registration
 EPA regulates pesticides under the statutory authority of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
 The registration requirements for antimicrobial pesticides differ somewhat from those of other pesticides.
 For example, EPA requires special tests to ensure efficacy of public health pesticides when the pests are invisible disease-causing microbes, rather than insects or rodents that may be harboring disease organisms.
 Similarly, determining human and ecological risks from exposure to antimicrobial pesticides requires different types of measurements and models than those needed for pesticides largely applied to crops and other plants.
 In view of these and other differences, EPA decided that its regulations governing pesticide registration requirements should also incorporate special antimicrobial sections.

 Antimicrobial Reregistration Reregistration
 The process of reregistration involves determining the "eligibility" of the active ingredients (a.i.) for all pesticides originally registered before November 1, 1984.
 These pesticides must be supported with a complete scientific analysis and show that they can be used without causing unreasonable adverse effects to human health or the environment.
 EPA is responsible for the development and issuance of Reregistration Eligibility Decision Documents (REDs) for all chemicals with mainly antimicrobial uses.
 The RED document formally present the Agency's evaluation of the data base supporting the reregistration of a pesticide (conclusions regarding which uses are eligible for reregistration under specific condition and requirements etc.).
 The Pesticides Reregistration Status page includes the antimicrobial REDs, their schedules, and completed documents and available fact sheets.
 Antimicrobial Registration and Reregistration Workplans Workplans
 Issued yearly, these workplans detail the registration of new pesticide active ingredients or new uses of antimicrobial pesticides, reregistration of antimicorbial pesticides, and special projects that are planned activities for the Office of Pesticide Programs for the stated fiscal year.

 Antimicrobial Health & Safety Safety
 Antimicrobials play an important role in public health and safety.
 While providing health benefits of pathogen removal and, in some cases, safety benefits of materials preservation, they also involve risks of potential efficacy failure and exposure hazards.
 It’s no wonder, then, that the effectiveness and proper use of these products are of widespread concern.

 ﻿Antiseptics (from Greek ἀντί - anti, '"against" + σηπτικός - sēptikos, "putrefactive"[2]) are antimicrobial substances that are applied to living tissue/skin to reduce the possibility of infection, sepsis, or putrefaction.
 Antiseptics are generally distinguished from antibiotics by the latter's ability to be transported through the lymphatic system to destroy bacteria within the body, and from disinfectants, which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects.
 Some antiseptics are true germicides, capable of destroying microbes (bacteriocidal), whilst others are bacteriostatic and only prevent or inhibit their growth.
 Antibacterials are antiseptics that have the proven ability to act against bacteria.
 Microbicides which destroy virus particles are called viricides or antivirals.

  Usage in surgery surgery
 The widespread introduction of antiseptic surgical methods followed the publishing of the paper Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery in 1867 by Joseph Lister, inspired by Louis Pasteur's germ theory of putrefaction.
 In this paper he advocated the use of carbolic acid (phenol) as a method of ensuring that any germs present were killed.
 Some of this work was anticipated by:
 * Dr.
 George H.
 Tichenor who experimented with the use of alcohol on wounds ca.
 1861–1863, and subsequently marketed a product for this purpose known as "Dr.
 Tichenor's Patent Medicine" after the American Civil War.
 * Ignaz Semmelweis who published his work The Cause, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever in 1861, summarizing experiments and observations since 1847.[3] 1847.[3]
 * Florence Nightingale, who contributed substantially to the report on the Royal Commission on the Health of the Army (1856–1857), based on her earlier work.
 * Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., who published The Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever in 1843.
 and even the ancient Greek physicians Galen (ca.
 130–200 AD) and Hippocrates (ca.
 400 BC).
 There is even a Sumerian clay tablet dating from 2150 BC advocating the use of similar techniques.[4] techniques.[4]
 But every antiseptic, however good, is more or less toxic and irritating to a wounded surface.
 Hence it is that the antiseptic method has been replaced in the surgery of today by the aseptic method, which relies on keeping free from the invasion of bacteria rather than destroying them when present.
  Functionality Functionality
 For the growth of bacteria there must be a food supply, moisture, in most cases oxygen, and a certain minimum temperature (see bacteriology).
 These conditions have been studied and applied in food preservation and the ancient practice of embalming the dead, which is the earliest known systematic use of antiseptics.
 In early inquiries, there was much emphasis on the prevention of putrefaction, and procedures were carried out to find how much of an agent must be added to a given solution in order to prevent development of undesirable bacteria.
 However, for various reasons[vague], this method was inaccurate, and today an antiseptic is judged by its effect on pure cultures of defined pathogenic celicular single helix microbes and their vegetative and spore forms.
 The standardization of antiseptics has been implemented in many instances, and a water solution of phenol of a certain fixed strength is now used as the standard to which other antiseptics are compared.
  Some common antiseptics antiseptics
 * *
 Alcohols Alcohols
 Most commonly used are ethanol (60–90%), 1-propanol (60–70%) and 2-propanol/isopropanol (70–80%) or mixtures of these alcohols.
 They are commonly referred to as "surgical alcohol".
 Used to disinfect the skin before injections are given, often along with iodine (tincture of iodine) or some cationic surfactants (benzalkonium chloride 0.05–0.5%, chlorhexidine 0.2–4.0% or octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1–2.0%).
 * *
 Quaternary ammonium compounds compounds
 Also known as Quats or QAC's, include the chemicals benzalkonium chloride (BAC), cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTMB), cetylpyridinium chloride (Cetrim, CPC) and benzethonium chloride (BZT).
 Benzalkonium chloride is used in some pre-operative skin disinfectants (conc.
 0.05–0.5%) and antiseptic towels.
 The antimicrobial activity of Quats is inactivated by anionic surfactants, such as soaps.
 Related disinfectants include chlorhexidine and octenidine.
 * *
 Boric acid acid
 Used in suppositories to treat yeast infections of the vagina, in eyewashes, and as an antiviral to shorten the duration of cold sore attacks.
 Put into creams for burns.
 Also common in trace amounts in eye contact solution.
 * *
 Brilliant Green Green
 A triarylmethane dye still widely used as 1% ethanol solution in Eastern Europe and ex-USSR countries for treatment of small wounds and abscesses.
 Efficient against gram-positive bacteria.
 * *
 Chlorhexidine Gluconate Gluconate
 A biguanidine derivative, used in concentrations of 0.5–4.0% alone or in lower concentrations in combination with other compounds, such as alcohols.
 Used as a skin antiseptic and to treat inflammation of the gums (gingivitis).
 The microbicidal action is somewhat slow, but remanent.
 It is a cationic surfactant, similar to Quats.
 * *
 Hydrogen peroxide peroxide
 Used as a 6% (20 Vols) solution to clean and deodorize wounds and ulcers.
 More common 3% solutions of hydrogen peroxide have been used in household first aid for scrapes, etc.
 However, even this less potent form is no longer recommended for typical wound care as the strong oxidization causes scar formation and increases healing time. Gentle washing with mild soap and water or rinsing a scrape with sterile saline is a better practice.
 * *
 Iodine Iodine
 Usually used in an alcoholic solution (called tincture of iodine) or as Lugol's iodine solution as a pre- and post-operative antiseptic.
 No longer recommended to disinfect minor wounds because it induces scar tissue formation and increases healing time.
 Gentle washing with mild soap and water or rinsing a scrape with sterile saline is a comparatively better practice.
 Novel iodine antiseptics containing povidone-iodine (an iodophor, complex of povidone, a water-soluble polymer, with triiodide anions I3-, containing about 10% of active iodine) are far better tolerated, don't negatively affect wound healing, and leave a deposit of active iodine, thereby creating the so-called "remnant," or persistent, effect.
 The great advantage of iodine antiseptics is their wide scope of antimicrobial activity, killing all principal pathogens and, given enough time, even spores, which are considered to be the most difficult form of microorganisms to be inactivated by disinfectants and antiseptics.
 * *
 Mercurochrome Mercurochrome
 Not recognized as safe and effective by the U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) due to concerns about its mercury content.
 Other obsolete organomercury antiseptics include bis-(phenylmercuric) monohydrogenborate (Famosept).
 * *
 Manuka Honey Honey
 Recognized by the U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medical device for use in wounds and burns.
 Active +15 is equal to a 15% solution of phenol.
 * *
 Octenidine dihydrochloride dihydrochloride
 A cationic surfactant and bis-(dihydropyridinyl)-decane derivative, used in concentrations of 0.1–2.0%.
 It is similar in its action to the Quats, but is of somewhat broader spectrum of activity.
 Octenidine is currently increasingly used in continental Europe as a QAC's and chlorhexidine (with respect to its slow action and concerns about the carcinogenic impurity 4-chloroaniline) substitute in water- or alcohol-based skin, mucosa and wound antiseptic.
 In aqueous formulations, it is often potentiated with addition of 2-phenoxyethanol.
 * *
 Phenol (carbolic acid) compounds compounds
 Phenol is germicidal in strong solution, inhibitory in weaker ones.
 Used as a "scrub" for pre-operative hand cleansing.
 Used in the form of a powder as an antiseptic baby powder, where it is dusted onto the navel as it heals.
 Also used in mouthwashes and throat lozenges, where it has a painkilling effect as well as an antiseptic one.
 Example:
 TCP.
 Other phenolic antiseptics include historically important, but today rarely used (sometimes in dental surgery) thymol, today obsolete hexachlorophene, still used triclosan and sodium 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate (Dibromol).
 * *
 Sodium chloride chloride
 Used as a general cleanser.
 Also used as an antiseptic mouthwash.
 Only a weak antiseptic effect, due to hyperosmolality of the solution above 0.9%.
 * *
 Sodium hypochlorite hypochlorite
 Used in the past, diluted, neutralized and combined with boric acid in Dakin's solution.
 (See Microcyn below.) below.)
 * *
 Calcium hypochlorite hypochlorite
 Used by Semmelweis, as "chlorinated lime", in his revolutionary efforts against childbed fever.
 * *
 Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (NaHCO3)
 has antiseptic and disinfectant properties.[5][6] properties.[5][6]
 * *
 Terpenes Terpenes
 are the main type of compound found in essential oils, and some have reasonably strong antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties.
 For example Terpinen-4-ol is found in Tea tree oil.
 * *
 Microcyn Microcyn
 is a compound of water, sodium chloride (0.023%), sodium hypochlorite (0.004%), and hypochlorous acid (0.003%).
 It became approved for sale on U.S.
 markets in June of 2011.
 It is neutral in ph, stingless, and tasteless.
 It does not injure normal tissue.
 It is effective against a wide variety of organisms from MRSA and other bacteria to fungi, viral disease forms such as HIV, and some spores.[7] spores.[7]
  Evolved resistance resistance
 See also Antibiotic resistance, Multiple drug resistance resistance
 By continued exposure to significant levels of antiseptics or antibiotics, bacteria can evolve to the point where they are no longer harmed by these compounds.[8] compounds.[8]
 Different antiseptics differ in how they cause bacteria to evolve, which leads to genetic defenses against particular compounds.
 It can also be dose dependent; resistance can occur at low doses but not at high; and resistance to one compound can sometimes increase resistance to others.
  Endogenous Endogenous
 The body produces its own antiseptics, which are a part of the chemical barriers of the immune system.
 The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the β-defensins.
[9] Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antiseptic.
 Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens.
 In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.
 ﻿The word “germ” comes from the Latin word for seed.
 As previously discussed in earlier Bug of the Month articles, most “germs” are actually helpful, with only a relative handful capable of producing disease.
 Disease causing germs (pathogens) include some spores, prions, bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
 Agents that can kill or slow down the growth of some of these harmful germs include sunlight, (UVrays), cold, heat, (steam under pressure and dry heat), and chemical agents.
 When speaking about chemical agents, there are four categories of germicides that cover a wide range of product chemistry and areas of use.
 They are sterilants, disinfectants, sanitizers and antiseptics.
 Sterilants, disinfectants and sanitizers are chemicals used to kill most harmful germs on surfaces.
 Antiseptics are agents used to kill germs on the skin.
 Chemical germicides are registered by the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and are classified as “pesticides”.
 “Pesticide” is defined by law in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest , and any substance or mixture of substances intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desicant.
 The term “pesticide” covers a wide spectrum of substances that are used to make our lives safer or more pleasurable.
 While most people think of pests as insects, the term can also refer to anything from viruses, bacteria, fungi, weeds, mice, bees and rats.
 More than 5000 antimicrobial products are currently registered with the EPA and sold in the marketplace.
 Nearly 60% of antimicrobial products are registered to control infectious microorganisms in hospitals and other health care environments.
 Beginning in 1994, the U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assumed regulatory responsibility for certain liquid and gaseous, (ethylene oxide), chemical agents used to sterilize reusable medical devices used in or on patients.
 Germicides can be more effectively utilized if their ability to kill is understood.
 Each of the following terms indicates a degree of action against micro-organisms from most effective, to least.
 They are as follows:
 Sterilant:
 	Includes chemical agents or devices, (such as glutaraldehyde or an autoclave), that destroy all living things including spores, bacteria, viruses and fungi.
 Sterilants are absolute…there is no such thing as something being “almost sterile”.
 Disinfectant:
 	 	
 A chemical agent that capable of killing pathogenic organisms but not spores.
 (also includes the terms germicide, bactericide, antibacterial, antimicrobial).
 Disinfectants are further classified as:
 1.
 minimal or limited claim, (capable of killing Salmonella cholerasuis or Staphylococcus aureus), aureus),
 2.
 broad spectrum , (capable of killing Salmonella and Staph.) and and
 3.
 hospital, (proven germical efficacy against Salmonella, Staph.
 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa).
 There is an additional disinfection category known as high level and usually is used to define a level of use safety for medical device decontamination on such things as endoscopes.
 Disinfectant products carry a significant number of kill claims on the label.
 The required efficacy shown above are the minimum required by the EPA.
 Disinfecting agents include ethanol (such as Lysol® Disinfectant Spray), quaternary ammonium compounds, bleach, and hydrogen peroxide.
 Sanitizer:
 	An agent that reduces the number of bacteria to a safe or acceptable level.
 This means a 99.9% kill as set by public health requirements.
 This term is applied to agents used to control germs present in food service, food preparation and food processing areas.
 Alcohol hand sanitizers also fall into this category.
 Products that sanitize food contact surfaces must achieve a 99.999% kill against bacteria.
 Antiseptic:
 	An agent that is generally applied to the skin and is used to prevent inflection and decay by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms.
 Because these products are used in or on living humans or animals, they are considered drugs and are thus approved and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 These agents include antibacterial hand soaps, isopropyl alcohol and iodine or iodophores.

 Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 Adobe PDF file The complete guideline is available for download in PDF format (948 KB / 158 pages).
 Regulatory Framework for Disinfectants and Sterilants Sterilants
 Before using the guidance provided in this document, health-care workers should be aware of the federal laws and regulations that govern the sale, distribution, and use of disinfectants and sterilants.
 In particular, health-care workers need to know what requirements pertain to them when they apply these products.
 Finally, they should understand the relative roles of EPA, FDA, and CDC so the context for the guidance provided in this document is clear.
 EPA and FDA FDA
 In the United States, chemical germicides formulated as sanitizers, disinfectants, or sterilants are regulated in interstate commerce by the Antimicrobials Division, Office of Pesticides Program, EPA, under the authority of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) of 1947, as amended 792.
 Under FIFRA, any substance or mixture of substances intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate any pest (including microorganisms but excluding those in or on living humans or animals) must be registered before sale or distribution.
 To obtain a registration, a manufacturer must submit specific data about the safety and effectiveness of each product.
 For example, EPA requires manufacturers of sanitizers, disinfectants, or chemical sterilants to test formulations by using accepted methods for microbiocidal activity, stability, and toxicity to animals and humans.
 The manufacturers submit these data to EPA along with proposed labeling.
 If EPA concludes the product can be used without causing "unreasonable adverse effects," then the product and its labeling are registered, and the manufacturer can sell and distribute the product in the United States.
 FIFRA also requires users of products to follow explicitly the labeling directions on each product.
 The following standard statement appears on all labels under the "Directions for Use" heading:
 "It is a violation of federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling." This statement means a health-care worker must follow the safety precautions and use directions on the labeling of each registered product.
 Failure to follow the specified use-dilution, contact time, method of application, or any other condition of use is considered a misuse of the product and potentially subject to enforcement action under FIFRA.
 In general, EPA regulates disinfectants and sterilants used on environmental surfaces, and not those used on critical or semicritical medical devices; the latter are regulated by FDA.
 In June 1993, FDA and EPA issued a "Memorandum of Understanding" that divided responsibility for review and surveillance of chemical germicides between the two agencies.
 Under the agreement, FDA regulates liquid chemical sterilants used on critical and semicritical devices, and EPA regulates disinfectants used on noncritical surfaces and gaseous sterilants 793.
 In 1996, Congress passed the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA).
 This act amended FIFRA in regard to several types of products regulated by both EPA and FDA.
 One provision of FQPA removed regulation of liquid chemical sterilants used on critical and semicritical medical devices from EPA's jurisdiction, and it now rests solely with FDA 792, 794.
 EPA continues to register nonmedical chemical sterilants.
 FDA and EPA have considered the impact of FQPA, and in January 2000, FDA published its final guidance document on product submissions and labeling.
 Antiseptics are considered antimicrobial drugs used on living tissue and thus are regulated by FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
 FDA regulates liquid chemical sterilants and high-level disinfectants intended to process critical and semicritical devices.
 FDA has published recommendations on the types of test methods that manufacturers should submit to FDA for 510[k] clearance for such agents.
 CDC CDC
 At CDC, the mission of the Coordinating Center for Infections Diseases is to guide the public on how to prevent and respond to infectious diseases in both health-care settings and at home.
 With respect to disinfectants and sterilants, part of CDC's role is to inform the public (in this case healthcare personnel) of current scientific evidence pertaining to these products, to comment about their safety and efficacy, and to recommend which chemicals might be most appropriate or effective for specific microorganisms and settings.
 Test Methods Methods
 The methods EPA has used for registration are standardized by the AOAC International; however, a survey of scientific literature reveals a number of problems with these tests that were reported during 1987–1990 58, 76, 80, 428, 736, 737, 795-800 that cause them to be neither accurate nor reproducible 416, 737.
 As part of their regulatory authority, EPA and FDA support development and validation of methods for assessing disinfection claims 801-803.
 For example, EPA has supported the work of Dr.
 Syed Sattar and coworkers who have developed a two-tier quantitative carrier test to assess sporicidal, mycobactericidal, bactericidal, fungicidal, virucidal, and protozoacidal activity of chemical germicides 701, 803.
 EPA is accepting label claims against hepatitis B virus (HBV) using a surrogate organism, the duck HBV, to quantify disinfectant activity 124, 804.
 EPA also is accepting labeling claims against hepatitis C virus using the bovine viral diarrhea virus as a surrogate.
 For nearly 30 years, EPA also performed intramural preregistration and postregistration efficacy testing of some chemical disinfectants in its own laboratories.
 In 1982, this was stopped, reportedly for budgetary reasons.
 At that time, manufacturers did not need to have microbiologic activity claims verified by EPA or an independent testing laboratory when registering a disinfectant or chemical sterilant 805.
 This occurred when the frequency of contaminated germicides and infections secondary to their use had increased 404.
 Investigations demonstrating that interlaboratory reproducibility of test results was poor and manufacturers' label claims were not verifiable 416, 737 and symposia sponsored by the American Society for Microbiology 800 heightened awareness of these problems and reconfirmed the need to improve the AOAC methods and reinstate a microbiologic activity verification program.
 A General Accounting Office report entitled Disinfectants:
 EPA Lacks Assurance They Work 806 seemed to provide the necessary impetus for EPA to initiate corrective measures, including cooperative agreements to improve the AOAC methods and independent verification testing for all products labeled as sporicidal and disinfectants labeled as tuberculocidal.
 For example, of 26 sterilant products tested by EPA, 15 were canceled because of product failure.
 A list of products registered with EPA and labeled for use as sterilants or tuberculocides or against HIV and/or HBV is available through EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/chemregindex.htmExternal Web Site Icon.
 Organizations (e.g., Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) are working to standardize requirements for germicide testing and registration.
 Top of Page Page
 Neutralization of Germicides Germicides
 One of the difficulties associated with evaluating the bactericidal activity of disinfectants is prevention of bacteriostasis from disinfectant residues carried over into the subculture media.
 Likewise, small amounts of disinfectants on environmental surfaces can make an accurate bacterial count difficult to get when sampling of the health-care environment as part of an epidemiologic or research investigation.
 One way these problems may be overcome is by employing neutralizers that inactivate residual disinfectants 807-809.
 Two commonly used neutralizing media for chemical disinfectants are Letheen Media and D/E Neutralizing Media.
 The former contains lecithin to neutralize quaternaries and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) to neutralize phenolics, hexachlorophene, formalin, and, with lecithin, ethanol.
 The D/E Neutralizing media will neutralize a broad spectrum of antiseptic and disinfectant chemicals, including quaternary ammonium compounds, phenols, iodine and chlorine compounds, mercurials, formaldehyde, and glutaraldehyde 810.
 A review of neutralizers used in germicide testing has been published published
 ﻿Overview of New Rule on Pesticide Use in Schools Schools
 Ohio has adopted a set of rules for structural pesticide use inside classroom buildings of of
 schools buildings and perimeter treatments.
 The rules are designed to reduce exposure exposure
 risk to pesticides for school children and staff.
 The Ohio Department of Agriculture Agriculture
 (ODA) is the enforcement agency.
 The main components of the regulation are defining the three situations for pesticide pesticide
 applications and establishing a prior notification policy and a school contact person.
 These rules apply if the pesticide is applied by a licensed school employee or a contracted contracted
 company.
 A complete version of the rules can be found in Ohio Administrative Codes, Codes,
 or on ODA’s website at:

 15_final.pdf 15_final.pdf
 Three Situations for Pesticide Applications Applications
 There are three situations under which pesticide applications are made, based on the time time
 of the application, the type of products used and the proximity of children and school school
 personnel during the application.
 The situations are:
 1.
 Applications During Off-School Hours Hours
 When an application is made after school hours or during a day when school is is
 not scheduled to be in session, there is no posting, restricted entry or product product
 requirements other than those on the label.
 An application that is made prior to to
 the school day must allow at least a four-hour re-entry period (unless a longer longer
 period is specified by the label.) label.)
 2.
 Applications During School Hours with Lower Exposure Potential Potential
 Certain pesticide product applications can be applied during school hours with no no
 posting or restricted entry requirements.
 These types of product applications are:
 • Manufactured paste or gel bait bait
 • Paraffin-based rodent control products placed in industry-identified, tamper- tamper-
 resistant bait stations stations
 • Termite-baiting stations stations
 • Rodenticides which are placed in wall voids or other areas that are are
 inaccessible to humans and pets pets
 • Dusts in unoccupied areas of the building building
 • Disinfectants, sanitizers, germicides and anti-microbial agents agents
 3.
 Other Applications of Pesticides During School Hours Hours
 Restricted entry and posting are required for any other pesticide applications than than
 those listed above that are applied during school hours.
 No children or staff staff
 (other than the pesticide applicator or necessary staff) may enter the treatment treatment
 area for during the treatment and for either four hours or the minimum time time
 specified on the product label (whichever is longer).
 The entrance to the area area
 must be posted with:
 • A sign that measures at least 8-1/2 by 11 inches inches
 • And, the sign must be printed in at least one-inch letters saying, “Pesticide “Pesticide
 Treatment Area.
 Do Not Enter Before (date and time where re-entry will be be
 permitted into the treatment area).
 Prior Notification Policy Policy
 The school district must develop a policy to provide prior notification of pesticide pesticide
 applications to anyone who requests it.
 This includes parents or guardians of minor minor
 children, adult students, faculty or staff.
 The school can determine the method of prior prior
 notification, such as e-mail or list-serves.
 Documentation must be kept to show that that
 requested notifications were made according to the policy developed by the individual individual
 school district.
 Contact Person and Recordkeeping for Notification Notification
 A school employee must be designated as a contact person for pesticide applications.
 The school contact person must maintain the pesticide application information required required
 for notification and the documentation that prior notifications were sent to the persons persons
 who requested them.
 Outside service companies must supply this pesticide application application
 information to the school contact person.
 The information must be available for for
 inspection during normal school hours.
 The school must maintain the information for one year.
 The pesticide application application
 information that must be kept by the school contact person include:
 • Date and time of the pesticide application application
 • Treatment area area
 • Target pests pests
 • Brand name and EPA registration number number
 • Time or conditions for re-entering the treatment area as specified by the label of the the
 pesticide applied, if any is specified.
 Additional reminders not in this new rule rule
 Under existing Ohio Pesticide Law all school employees who make pesticide applications applications
 must be a licensed commercial applicator or trained serviceperson working under the the
 direct supervision of a licensed applicator.
 They must keep complete records of all all
 pesticide applications for three years that include more items than those listed above for for
 the notification policy.
 Comprehensive IPM plans for schools are optional.
 However, if schools want to develop develop
 an IPM program, the new IPM standards for Ohio must be followed.

 Introduction Introduction
 Chemical germicides are used everywhere -- from the sterilization of medical instruments in hospitals to the cleaning of a household kitchen counter.
 They provide a convenient method of inactivating a variety of microorganisms that may cause harm.
 Chemical germicides are known by several names, including antimicrobials, disinfectants, sporicides, sanitizers and sterilants, just to name a few.
 They are designed to destroy a variety of pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, bacteria spores, molds and fungi.
 They are divided into three general categories:
 sterilants, disinfectants and antiseptics.
 Sterilants kill microorganisms on medical equipment and devices as well as surfaces.
 This includes bacterial spores which can survive other germicides.
 Disinfectants are regulated by the EPA.
 Disinfectants, which can be classified as high-, medium-, or low-level depending on the strength required, kill nearly all microbial life on objects or surfaces except for bacterial spores.
 Antiseptics are used to inactivate or destroy organisms on skin or living tissue.
 Applications Applications
 Determining which category of germicide to use depends on the function of the device or surface that is being considered.
 It should be noted that steam autoclaving or ethylene oxide sterilization may damage certain instruments, so chemical germicides must be used.
 Critical devices that enter sterile areas of the body or protrude into the blood barrier must be sterilized to prevent contamination (e.g.
 endoscopes, forceps, hemodialyzers).
 Semi-critical devices which only come in contact with mucous membranes and do not penetrate body tissues can be sterilized or cleaned with a high-level disinfectant, depending on the application (e.g.
 fiber-optic endoscopes, vaginal specula, dental and ophthalmic devices).
 Non-critical devices that only come in contact with intact skin can be cleaned with a low-level disinfectant (e.g.
 stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, electrodes and measuring devices).
 Equipment surfaces including handles, knobs or carts, as well as housekeeping surfaces like sinks, counters or floors can also be cleaned with a low-level disinfectant.
 Germicidal Effectiveness Effectiveness
 Many factors influence the effectiveness of germicides, including the:
 * Shape of the object being cleaned, including its surface texture and if it is flat or has cracks cracks
 * Amount of microbiologicals on the surface surface
 * Resistance of the microbiologicals to the germicide germicide
 * Amount of additional soil buildup on the object, including blood, mucous or tissue tissue
 * Chemical composition of the germicide germicide
 * Time of exposure to the germicide germicide
 * Temperature of the germicide germicide
 Generally, bacterial spores (e.g.
 Bacillus subtilis) have the most resistance to germicides followed by mycobacteria (e.g.
 Mycobacterium tuberculosis), non-lipid viruses (e.g.
 poliovirus), fungi (e.g.
 Cryptococcus), vegetative bacteria (e.g.
 Salmonella choleraesuis), and lipid viruses (e.g.
 human immunodeficiency virus) with the least resistance.
 Due to the many factors that affect germicides, each object that is to be cleaned must be analyzed for the best method and germicide to use.
 It is of great importance to read and understand the manufacturer's instructions to know which application the product is designed for, as well as the instructions for its proper use.

 Regulatory Agencies Agencies
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Pesticides oversees the use of disinfectants.
 Manufacturers are required to test products using pre-established test procedures on product stability, toxicity to people, and microbial activity.
 If the product passes these requirements, it is registered by the agency and ready for trade.
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees sterilants and germicides that are required for a specific medical device.
 The manufacturers must submit specific microbial activity data to the FDA prior to a pre-market notification or 510(k) being issued.
 Once the 510(k) is issued, the product is ready for trade.
 Antiseptics or drugs used on or in the human body are also regulated by the FDA.
 This includes antimicrobial soaps, antiseptics, scrubs and wound protectants, which are simply categorized by an advisory panel that scrutinizes non-prescription germicidal products.
 Manufacturers can voluntarily submit information on these products.
 Commonly Asked Questions Questions
 Q.		Are chemical germicides required by any OSHA regulation?
 A.		Yes.
 The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1030, requires the use of germicides.
 Housekeeping requirements mandate the use of decontamination and disinfection procedures for all equipment and working surfaces when contacted with blood or other potentially infectious materials.
 In addition, general work practices require that handwashing facilities be made available.
 If they are not feasible, an antiseptic hand cleanser and towels or antiseptic towelettes must be available.
 (For more information on the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, see EZ Facts document #105.) #105.)
 Q.		Can antiseptics be used as disinfectants and vice versa?
 A.		No.
 Disinfectants are designed for use on objects and surfaces and may be too strong for use on skin or tissue.
 Conversely, antiseptics may not be strong enough to provide a thorough disinfection of surfaces and objects.
 ﻿Disinfectants are registered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as “antimicrobial “antimicrobial
 pesticides” and are defined as substances used to control harmful microorganisms on inanimate inanimate
 objects and surfaces.
 Data on a product’s chemistry, efficacy, toxicity to humans, animals and and
 plants, and other parameters must be tested and submitted to the EPA prior to the marketing of of
 the chemical.
 Product labels contain important details to assist with infection control efforts.
 Additionally, it is is
 a violation of federal law to use a product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.
 Therefore, strict attention must be given to the proper use of a product with regard to its its
 application, effectiveness, and associated hazards (human, animal, and environment).
 EPA Registration Number (EPA Reg.
 No.).
 All disinfectants (“antimicrobial pesticides”) sold in the U.S.
 must be registered with the EPA.
 The registration number shows the product has been reviewed by the EPA and the product can can
 be used with minimal risk, if the label directions are followed properly.
 The number is not an an
 endorsement or guarantee of product effectiveness.
 EPA Establishment Number (EPA Est.
 No.).
 This number identifies the particular facility where the final phase of production of the the
 disinfectant product occurred.
 Label Claims.
 Disinfectants may have a range of uses, such as cleaner, deodorizer, sanitizer, disinfectant, disinfectant,
 fungicide, virucide or ‘for hospital, institutional and industrial use’.
 Label claims must be be
 supported by efficacy testing.
 Three test microorganisms are used, Staphylococcus aureus for for
 Gram-positive, Salmonella cholerasuis for Gram-negative, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for for
 medical-hospital use designations.
 • Limited efficacy is a claim of disinfection or germicidal activity against one specific specific
 microorganism group, either Gram-positive (S.
 aureus) or Gram-negative (S.
 cholerasuis).
 The label must specify the group against which the product is effective.
 • General-purpose or broad-spectrum is a claim of effectiveness against Gram- Gram-
 positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
 This claim must be supported by efficacy efficacy
 testing against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella cholerasuis.
 • A hospital or medical environment claim must be supported by efficacy testing testing
 against S.
 aureus and S.
 cholerasuis and also the nosocomial bacterial pathogen, pathogen,
 Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
 Claims against pathogenic fungi or other microorganisms are permitted on the label following following
 standardized testing procedures, but are not required.
 Effectiveness of Product Under Certain Conditions.
 Testing for the EPA requires simulating the product’s effectiveness under field conditions.
 This is is
 typically conducted under “hard” water up to 400 ppm hardness (CaCo3) in the presence of 5% 5%
 serum contamination.
 If the product is tested under additional conditions, it may be listed on on
 the label.
 Active Ingredients.
 The individual active ingredients contained in the product are listed here as percentages and and
 lists the chemicals responsible for the control of the microorganisms.
 (This example is a a
 quaternary ammonium compound [QAC]).
 Percentages should not be directly compared compared
 between products, as the dilution ratios for use may be different.
 Inert Ingredients.
 Inactive ingredients are often lumped into one statement and include items such as soaps or or
 detergents, dyes or coloring agents, perfumes, and water.
 Precautionary Statement.
 This describes the potential hazards to people or animals and actions to take to reduce those those
 hazards (i.e., wearing gloves or goggles).
 Specific “signal words” are used to define and and
 indicate the degree of hazard.
 Descriptors used (from least harmful to most harmful) are:
 “Caution”, “Warning”, “Danger” and “Danger-Poison”.
 First Aid.
 This lists the actions to take in the event of accidental swallowing, inhalation or contact with the the
 product.
 A “Notes to physicians” area may be listed with specific medical information needed by by
 medical professionals.
 Additional Precautionary Statements.
 The product label will also list additional safety and precautionary information.
 • Environmental hazards tell if the product is potentially hazardous to fish, wildlife, wildlife,
 plants or if it may adversely affect wetlands or water resources.
 It also provides ways ways
 to avoid environmental damage.
 • Physical or chemical hazards address issues such as corrosiveness or or
 flammability.
 • Storage and disposal tells you how to best store the product and how to dispose dispose
 of unused product and its container.
 • The warranty statement is intended to limit a company’s liability or to act as a a
 disclaimer or warranty for the product.
 Manufacturer’s name/address name/address
 The name, address and sometimes phone number of the manufacturer or distributor of the the
 product is listed.
 Directions for Use.
 This section tells you what the product controls, as well as where, how and when to use it.
 Some products may have multiple uses (i.e., cleaning versus disinfection) and require different different
 dilutions and contact times for such actions.
 The best application method to use with the the
 product (i.e., spray directly or wipe on surfaces) will also be listed.
 Some manufacturers provide provide
 a toll-free number to obtain additional information about their products.
 Fungicidal Control.
 For this sample product, high concentrations (2 ounces per gallon) are –cidal while lower lower
 concentrations may only be fungistatic.
 Virucidal Activity.
 This may only specify a class, such as enveloped viruses, but may or may not be efficacious efficacious
 against non-enveloped viruses.
 Most disinfectants are effective against enveloped viruses.
 Sanitizer.
 At this concentration the product only cleans and reduces the number of bacteria present but is is
 not germicidal.
 ﻿This is the second part of a four part series on disinfectants intended to educate and and
 inform IEHA members and non-members alike.
 Part I can be found in the January, January,
 2006 issue of EHT.
 With each of these four articles, there is a test of the reader‟s reader‟s
 knowledge and grasp of these important concepts.
 You will have an opportunity to to
 take the exam and submit it for continuing education units (CEU‟s) of credit toward toward
 maintaining your Certified Executive Housekeeper (CEH) or Registered Executive Executive
 Housekeeper (REH) status.
 The outline for this series is adapted with revisions from a reference book that should should
 be on every IEHA member‟s bookshelf.
 The title is, “The Practical Application of of
 Disinfection and Sterilization in Health Care Facilities” and is co-authored by James C.
 Cokendolfer and Jill F.
 Haukos.
 While this author does not agree with everything everything
 written in the guide by Cokendolfer and Haukos, this book has proven to be essential essential
 as a reference for questions surrounding the topic of chemical disinfectants and the the
 process of disinfecting environmental surfaces.
 In this second installment, we want to have a discussion of the methods used to to
 register disinfectants with EPA; what to look for when reading a germicide label; label;
 OSHA‟s attempt to protect workers exposed to bloodborne pathogens; and, the the
 scientific guidelines and other governmental standards.
 Using best management practices for disinfecting will help insure that you are are
 cleaning appropriately to kill the bugs-microbes-you need to kill.
 Because Because
 disinfectants are designed to kill, they are toxic.
 Chemicals used as disinfectants can can
 be corrosive, irritants and possibly carcinogenic.
 With best management practices practices
 use only the amount of disinfectant necessary to do the job.
 Ultimately, best best
 management practices protect patients, employees and the environment.
 That being said, there is a myriad of federal government agencies that have the regulatory regulatory
 oversight of disinfectants, sterilants, and antiseptics and their use by workers.
 Some of those agencies are:
 1 1
 EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Agency)
  
 FDA (Food and Drug Administration) Administration)
  
 FTC (Federal Trade Commission) Commission)
  
 OSHA (Occupational Health and Safety Administration) Administration)
  
 EPA EPA
 When the EPA was formed in 1970, the use and dumping of pesticides was a big problem in in
 America.
 The US Department of Agriculture held that responsibility until the formation of the the
 EPA.
 Because disinfectants are designed to kill living organisms on inanimate objects, the EPA EPA
 regulates them as “pesticides”.
 OPP OPP
 The Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) and Office of Compliance Monitoring are responsible responsible
 for evaluating pesticide registration, as well as planning and coordinating pesticide compliance compliance
 and enforcement activities, respectively.
 The Antimicrobial Program Branch (APB) within the the
 OPP is directly responsible for registering disinfectants and sterilants.
 For clarification, there is a distinct difference between antimicrobials and and
 disinfectants.
 Disinfectant = a chemical intended to destroy or inactivate inactivate
 microorganisms on inanimate surfaces.
 Antimicrobials = any agent that kills or or
 inhibits the growth or replication of microorganisms; term encompasses both both
 antiseptic and disinfectant products.
 FIFRA FIFRA
 The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (U.S.
 EPA, 1988) is a law administered administered
 by the EPA by regulating disinfectants as pesticides.
 A pesticide is defined as “any substance or or
 mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest...” pest...”
 Disinfectants destroy or prevent “pests” (living microorganisms, pathogens, bacteria, etc.).
 Disinfectants are used to maintain the public’s health and must be tested against a standard standard
 established by the EPA to verify efficacy.
 The GAO (the General Accounting Office) determined in 1990 that the EPA did not not
 know whether disinfectants and sterilants killed the germs as claimed on product product
 labels for the following four reasons reasons
  “The methods and performance standards used to assess the efficacy of disinfectants had had
 been, and continues to be, the source of scientific controversy.
  The EPA had made little progress in resolving these controversies because of budget budget
 constraints and inadequate research management.
  The EPA lacked sufficient internal controls to ensure the quality and integrity of the data data
 that registrants submitted on disinfectant efficacy.
  The EPA lacked an enforcement strategy to ensure that, once registered, disinfectants disinfectants
 sold and distributed in the marketplace worked as claimed.”1 claimed.”1
 2 2
 At the time of these GAO findings, it was estimated that up to 20% of the “EPA “EPA
 registered disinfectants” were ineffective.
 The public‟s health was being being
 compromised when the EPA was directed to reevaluate the efficacy testing of of
 sterilants and other products.
 The GAO had these particular concerns:
 1.
 Human exposure to antimicrobial chemicals may be more significant than once once
 thought and that additional, long-term toxicology data may be necessary for these these
 chemicals.
 2.
 Unsupported labeling and advertising claims were made by some antimicrobial antimicrobial
 pesticide registrants, thus creating a false sense of security among health care care
 professionals relying on the product.
 3.
 Test methods used to evaluate the efficacy of antimicrobial products may be be
 unreliable.2 unreliable.2
 AOAC Testing Testing
 The EPA announced in 1990 the initiation of a three-step program to validate the the
 efficacy of all (1) chemical sterilants, as well as (2) tuberculocidal, and (3) hospital hospital
 disinfectants.
 Chemical sterilants are used as cold sterilants on medical devices that that
 cannot be steam sterilized.
 Under the new EPA program a product was tested one or two batches using the the
 Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) Sporicidal Test methodology.
 The The
 Association of Official Analytical Chemists is a scientific organization devoted to the the
 validation of methods of analysis; AOAC-approved methods are used to determine the the
 antimicrobial activity of disinfectants and sterilants.
 “If the product passed the screen, no further testing was required.
 However, if the the
 product failed the AOAC screen, enforcement action was taken to prohibit further further
 sale and distribution of the specific batch(es) tested, and further testing of more more
 batches was conducted.
 If three or more batches failed, enforcement action was was
 taken to prevent all commercial movement of all batches of the product.
 All sterilant sterilant
 products tested remained on the market while the EPA conducted the efficacy of of
 testing.” 3 3
 Tuberculocidal Tuberculocidal
 A tuberculocidal disinfectant is an intermediate-level disinfectant (refer to “Part I, I,
 Disinfectants-What‟s in Your Bucket”.
 pg.
 5, January 2006/Executive Housekeeping Housekeeping
 Today).
 The tuberculocidal claim is issued to those products with proven efficacy efficacy
 against Mycobacterium bovis or M.
 tuberculosis.
 “Potency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been recognized as a substantial substantial
 benchmark.
 However, the tuberculocidal claim is used only as a benchmark to measure measure
 germicidal potency.
 Tuberculosis is not transmitted via environmental surfaces but but
 rather by the airborne route.
 Accordingly, use of such products on environmental environmental
 3 3
 surfaces plays no role in preventing the spread of tuberculosis.
 However, because because
 mycobacteria have among the highest intrinsic levels of resistance among the the
 vegetative bacteria, viruses, and fungi, any germicide with a tuberculocidal claim on the the
 label is considered capable of inactivating a broad spectrum of pathogens, including including
 such less-resistant organisms as bloodborne pathogens (e.g., HBV, HCV, and HIV).
 It is is
 this broad-spectrum capability, rather than the product's specific potency against against
 mycobacteria, that is the basis for protocols and regulations dictating use of of
 tuberculocidal chemicals for surface disinfection.” 4 4
 Hospital Disinfectant Disinfectant
 Disinfectants with effectiveness against Salmonella cholerasuis, Staphylococcus Staphylococcus
 aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be labeled as “hospital disinfectant” or or
 “hospital-level disinfectant”.
 “EPA requires manufacturers to test formulations by using accepted methods for for
 microbicidal activity, stability, and toxicity to animals and humans.
 Manufacturers Manufacturers
 submit these data to EPA with proposed labeling.
 If EPA concludes a product may be be
 used without causing unreasonable adverse effects, the product and its labeling are are
 given an EPA registration number, and the manufacturer may then sell and distribute distribute
 the product in the United States.
 FIFRA requires users of products to follow the the
 labeling directions on each product explicitly.
 The following statement appears on all all
 EPA-registered product labels under the Directions for Use heading:
 "It is a violation of of
 federal law to use this product inconsistent with its labeling." This means that that
 healthcare professionals must follow the safety precautions and use directions on the the
 labeling of each registered product.
 Not following the specified dilution, contact contact
 time, method of application, or any other condition of use is considered misuse of the the
 product.”5 product.”5
 Review the labels of your current disinfectants.
 Do these solutions match the profile profile
 of the microbes you need to kill?
 The labels of concentrated disinfectants also state state
 the proper level of dilution for maximum effectiveness.
 Product sales literature and labels must accurately communicate important important
 precautions and instructions to the user so that each product is effective without without
 causing unreasonable adverse effects to humans or the environment (US EPA, 1994).
 In addition, the label is a legal, enforceable document.
 Therefore, labels must meet the following general criteria (US EPA, 1992):
 4 4
 Be clear and understandable to the user under normal conditions.
  
 Provide accurate precautions and directions that protect the user, other other
  
 humans, and the environment.
 Contain no false or misleading statements or implied federal government government
  
 approval or endorsements.
 Clearly distinguish between what is mandatory and enforceable and what is is
  
 only a recommendation and cannot be enforced.
 Comply with the EPA‟s regulatory requirements as listed below.

 These statements inform you of the proper precautions to take take
 to better protect yourself and others from harmful effects of pesticide exposure.
 Hazard statements are not located in the same place on all pesticide labels.
 Precautions include:
 Item 7—Human Hazard Signal Words (Danger/Poison, Warning, Cautions).
 Human Human
 hazard signal words indicate the level of toxicity of the pesticide product.
 Further Further
 discussions of toxicity categories will be held in Part IV.
 Item 8—Child Hazard Warning (Keep Out of the Reach of Children).
 The Child Hazard Hazard
 Warning must be on the front panel of the label on all pesticide products.

 information about routes of pesticide exposure to humans (i.e., mouth, skin, lungs) lungs)
 and specific actions to take to prevent pesticide exposure (e.g., protective clothing, clothing,
 respirators).
 Item 11—Environmental Hazards.
 If a pesticide is markedly hazardous to wildlife, wildlife,
 the label must bear special toxicity statements such as “this product is highly toxic to to
 birds, or to fish”.
 General environmental precautions may include “do not apply apply
 directly to water, or do not contaminate water, food, or feed by storage and disposal disposal
 of the pesticide.” pesticide.”
 Item 12—Physical/Chemical Hazards.
 These statements provide information about about
 the flammability or explosive characteristics of the pesticide product.

 All labels are required to bear storage and disposal disposal
 statements.
 These statements are developed for specific containers, sizes and and
 chemical content.
 ITEM 14—Directions for Use.
 Directions for use must be stated in terms that are are
 easily read and understood by the average person likely to use or to supervise the use use
 of the product.
 When followed, directions must be adequate to protect the public public
 from fraud and personal injury, as well as prevent unreasonable adverse adverse
 6 6
 environmental effects (including medical instruments).
 Directions for use must must
 include the following:
 The site(s) of appropriate application application
  
 Identification of the target microorganisms that the product will be effective in in
  
 controlling at each use site site
 The dilution and rate of application to be used for each site and micro- micro-
  
 organism organism
 The method of application, including instruction for dilution, if required, and and
  
 type(s) of application apparatus or equipment required required
 The frequency and timing of applications necessary to obtain effective results results
  
 without causing unreasonable adverse effects to the environment environment
 Any limitations or restrictions on use required to prevent unreasonable adverse adverse
  
 effects (i.e., requirements for ventilation, respirators, protective clothing, clothing,
 etc.) when using the product.
 ITEM 15—Misuse Statement.
 All products must bear the misuse statement, “It is a a
 violation of Federal Law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its its
 labeling.” That would include adding other chemicals (like a deodorizer) to the in-use in-use
 product.
 Or, adding more chemical than the label requires just because a worker worker
 thinks the situation dictates they do so.
 Collateral Labeling.
 Leaflets, data sheets, or other written, printed or graphic graphic
 matter that is referred to on the label or accompanies the product are called called
 collateral labeling.
 Such associated literature may not bear claims or representations representations
 that substantially differ from those accepted in connection with the registration of of
 the product.
 Supplemental Registration.
 The EPA allows a registrant of a pesticide product to to
 distribute or sell its registered product under another company‟s name and address address
 instead of, or in addition to, its own name.
 For example, ABC Company can can
 manufacture a product called ABC Disinfectant (this would be an example of a a
 “primary registration”).
 ABC can also sell that same chemical formulation to XYZ XYZ
 Company and XYZ can, in turn, rename it XYZ Disinfectant.
 ABC and XYZ XYZ
 Disinfectants are actually the same product, but with different names.
 The The
 registration of the XYZ product would be termed a “supplemental registration” or a a
 “distributor product.” The distributor is considered an agent of the registrant and and
 both the registrant and the distributor are accountable for violations pertaining to the the
 distributor product.
 It is important to note that supplemental registrations are only an extension of a a
 currently registered pesticide product.
 They are a duplication of the primary primary
 registered product and must in turn, reflect any changes made to the basic basic
 registration as they occur.
 For example, both ABC and XYZ disinfectants should have have
 the same active ingredients at the same percentages, same instructions, and same same
 label claims.
 All legal action taken against the primary registered products (e.g., ABC ABC
 7 7
 Disinfectant) will also affect supplementary registered products (e.g., XYZ XYZ
 Disinfectant).
 The EPA Registration Number of a distributor product is the same as that of the the
 primary registered product, but has, in addition, another hyphen followed by the the
 “Distributor‟s” company number.
 For example, if the product is EPA Reg.
 No.
 9999- 9999-
 8888, and the distributor‟s company number is 7777, then the distributor‟s number number
 that would appear on the label would be EPA Reg.
 No.
 9999-8888-7777.
 The important points to find on an antimicrobial label are the following:
 EPA Registration Number—either as a set of two numbers (e.g., 9999-8888) or or
  
 three numbers (e.g., 9999-8888-7777) 9999-8888-7777)
 Label instructions—clear and appropriate for your situation situation
  
 Use and reuse instructions—clear and specific (pre-clean?) (pre-clean?)
  
 Dilution instructions—clean and specific (what ppm water hardness, sterile sterile
  
 broth, in the presence of blood, different pathogens, etc.) etc.)
 List of organisms the product will effectively control control
  
 Contact times and temperatures temperatures
  
 All this information should be clearly marked on the label and understandable to the the
 reader.
 If it is not, I recommend that you look at other available chemical options.
 I I
 also recommend communicating any problems or concerns to the product product
 manufacturer.
 Manufacturers cannot begin addressing problems until they become become
 aware of them.
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration Administration
 “OSHA Instruction CPL 2-2.44C” “Enforcement Procedures for the Occupational Occupational
 Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1030” was issued by the the
 federal agency on March 6, 1992.
 This document was written for OSHA‟s field field
 inspectors who survey hospitals, dentist‟s offices, emergency response officials, officials,
 schools, beauticians, tatooists, electrologists and day care centers.
 But, it provides provides
 those who clean facilities that might become contaminated with blood or other other
 potentially infectious materials (OPIM) with cleaning instructions.
 Included in this this
 document is new requirements on what disinfectants these groups needed to use to to
 comply with OSHA; specifically, they now had to be prepared to appropriately appropriately
 disinfect any surface contaminated by human blood or OPIM.
 OSHA’s Bloodborne Pathogens Standard Standard
 OSHA is concerned about the health and safety of workers in America.
 With the the
 emergence of HIV, HBV and AIDS in the „80‟s, OSHA developed its Occupational Occupational
 Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, Final Rule in 1991 to protect employees employees
 from occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens.
 The rule defines potentially potentially
 8 8
 infectious materials as human blood, human blood components, products made from from
 human blood, semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva in dental dental
 procedures, any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids fluids
 in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids.
 Housekeepers and those employed to clean and maintain the workplace are on the the
 expansive list of those occupations with potential exposure to bloodborne pathogens.
 The Standard requires employers within all these occupations must have an Exposure Exposure
 Control Plan defining employee actions to avoid an exposure to any of these body body
 fluids and steps to take in the event of an exposure.
 The Standard also states that that
 employers must ensure that:
 “The worksite is maintained in a clean and sanitary condition...contaminated condition...contaminated
 work surfaces shall be decontaminated with an appropriate disinfectant after after
 completion of procedures; immediately or as soon as feasible when surfaces surfaces
 are overtly contaminated or after any spill of blood or other potentially potentially
 infectious materials; and at the end of the work shift if the surface may have have
 become contaminated since the last cleaning.” 6 6
 Bloodborne Pathogen Standard Compliance Compliance
 Within this definition, the amount of blood required to cause “contamination” is is
 defined as “any spill of blood.” Therefore, a surface is just as contaminated with a a
 speck of blood as it is with a pool of blood.
 A strain of bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis or mTB) causes tuberculosis (TB).
 Because of its hard “shell” members of Mycobacterium are resistant to chemical chemical
 disinfectants.
 Both HIV and HBV are easily inactivated by lower-potency level level
 disinfectants (Bond, 1994) such as quaternary ammonium compounds.
 This is very important to understand.
 Cleaning blood of any amount with a product product
 other than a tuberculocidal or a sodium hypochlorite (household bleach dilution of of
 1:10 for porous surfaces or 1:100 for nonporous surfaces) is not acceptable as being being
 effective against mTB.
 Rubbing alcohols and hydrogen peroxide are not acceptable as as
 being effective against mTB unless they are incorporated into a tuberculocidal tuberculocidal
 disinfectant registered with the EPA.
 According to OSHA, quats are not acceptable for decontamination of blood or body body
 fluid spills.
 The following letter of interpretation was written to clarify the the
 appropriate protocol for cleaning spills of an unknown bloodborne pathogen.
 The only only
 situation where you might know for sure the bloodborne pathogen to be deactivated deactivated
 would be in a research lab setting where these viruses are present.
 If you don‟t don‟t
 know, you must use a product with an mTB claim for cleanup of blood spills.

 Dear Mr.
 Bach:
 This is in response to your letter of December 10, 1996.
 You have requested a clarification of the the
 Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) position on disinfectants claiming efficacy efficacy
 9 9
 against the Hepatitis B virus.
 You have asked if the products with the EPA approval meet the the
 requirements of the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard without a registered tuberculocidal claim.
 A review of the initial intent of the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard that specifically deals with the the
 cleaning of contaminated work surfaces, i.e., 1910.1030(d)(4)(ii)(A), reveals that OSHA intended to to
 provide a performance-based provision that would allow for future development of "appropriate "appropriate
 disinfectant" products.
 OSHA has reviewed the information on the disinfectants and has reconsidered reconsidered
 its position on EPA-registered disinfectants that are labeled as effective against HBV and HIV.

 current stance is that EPA-registered disinfectants for HIV and HBV meet the requirement in the the
 standard and are "appropriate" disinfectants to clean contaminated surfaces, provided such surfaces surfaces
 have not become contaminated with agent(s) or volumes of or concentrations of agent(s) for which which
 higher-level disinfection is recommended.
 (Emphasis added) added)
 It is important to emphasize the EPA-approved label section titled "SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR FOR
 CLEANING AND DECONTAMINATION AGAINST HIV-1 AND HBV Of SURFACES\OBJECTS SOILED WITH WITH
 BLOOD\BODY FLUIDS." On the labels that OSHA has seen, these instructions require:
 personal protection devices for the worker performing the task; task;
  
 that all the blood must be cleaned thoroughly before applying the disinfectant; disinfectant;
  
 that the disposal of the infectious waste is in accordance with federal, state, or local local
  
 regulations; regulations;
 that the surface is left wet with the disinfectant for 30 seconds for HIV-1 and 10 minutes for for
  
 HBV.
 OSHA would expect all such disinfectants to be used in accordance with their EPA-approved label label
 instructions.
 We thank you for your interest in workplace safety and health.
 Sincerely, Sincerely,
 John B.
 Miles, Jr., Director [Directorate of Enforcement Programs] Programs]
 [Corrected 2/10/2005] 2/10/2005]
 In closing, we have noted there are several agencies with regulatory jurisdiction and and
 other groups proposing guidelines for the use of disinfectants.
 As a housekeeping or or
 facility professional, you need to determine the appropriate steps to follow when when
 establishing policies and procedures for cleaning of spills containing blood or other other
 potentially infectious body fluids.
 Be aware that there may be laws put forth by local local
 or state governments that may be more restrictive than the federal laws.
 Local and and
 state laws cannot be less stringent, but may be more stringent.
 Do not look to state or federal agencies with jurisdictional oversight to provide any any
 assistance with choosing an appropriate disinfectant.
 They can simply provide you you
 with an “all or nothing list”.
 These governmental agencies pass or fail a product product
 based on a review of research test data.
 A chemical‟s submission has been reviewed and cleared marketing in the U.S.
 A A
 product registered with the EPA is not promoted over any other product registered for for
 the same task (i.e., hospital disinfectant, sterilants, etc.) etc.)
 10 10
 When writing your department or facility bloodborne pathogen exposure control plan, plan,
 I recommend that you take a “big picture” approach.
 That is, don‟t target HIV or HBV HBV
 as though those are the only bloodborne pathogens of concern.
 Look at all types of of
 pathogenic microorganisms.
 The goal is to devise a plan that protects workers, workers,
 patients and others from pathogens that could, realistically, be transferred from from
 either direct or indirect contact with environmental surfaces.
 Work with your your
 infection control department and this Association to devise a complete, workable workable
 plan.
 In Part III, we will be looking at the standards and guidelines of the Centers for for
 Disease Control (CDC), the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Healthcare
 Organizations (JCAHO), and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control Control
 (APIC).
 Additionally, we will look at the pros and cons of disinfectants such as bleach, bleach,
 peroxy compounds, alcohols, halogens, phenolics, quaternary ammonium compounds compounds
 (quats) and new, emerging disinfectant products.
 Then, we will look into how to to
 control selected microorganisms such as C-diff, CJD, HIV, HBV and mTB.

 JUNE 30, 1994 1994
 PESTICIDE REGULATION (PR) NOTICE 94-4 94-4
 NOTICE TO MANUFACTURERS, FORMULATORS, PRODUCERS AND AND
 REGISTRANTS OF PESTICIDE PRODUCTS PRODUCTS
 ATTENTION:
 Persons Responsible for Registration of Pesticides Pesticides
 SUBJECT :
 Interim Measures for the Registration of of
 Antimicrobial Products/Liquid Chemical Germicides Germicides
 with Medical Device Use Claims Under the the
 Memorandum of Understanding Between EPA and FDA FDA
 Purpose Purpose
 I.
 This Notice is intended to provide the regulated community community
 with detailed guidance on the interim EPA registration procedures procedures
 for antimicrobial products affected by the June 4, 1993, 1993,
 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Environmental Environmental
 Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration Administration
 (FDA) as amended.
 Copies of the signed MOU and its amendment are are
 included with this Notice.
 11.
 Applicability Applicability
 This Notice applies to all registrants of liquid chemical chemical
 germicides which bear claims for use on medical devices.
 While While
 EPA has regulatory authority over all antimicrobial products products
 which bear claims to act against microorganisms on inanimate inanimate
 surfaces, FDA's regulatory purview extends to liquid chemical chemical
 germicides which are used on medical devices and are therefore therefore
 considered to be medical devices themselves.
 Because FDA's FDA's
 regulatory concern focuses on the application of chemical chemical
 germicides to medical devices, the MOU is relevant only to those those
 antimicrobial pesticides with medical device use claims.
 The manner in which FDA determines the required level of of
 processing needed for a medical device is based on Dr.
 E.H.
 Spaulding's infection control classification system, as adapted adapted
 and recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Prevention
 (CDC).
 In this system, medical devices are categorized according according
 to the relative risk asspciated with their intended use patterns.
 The three primary categories are (1) critical surfaces which must must
 be sterilized, (2) semi-critical su-faces which should be be
 sterilized but must at least undergo high level disinfection, and and
 (3) non-critical surfacgs including medical equipment surfaces surfaces
 which should undergo intermediate or low level disinfection.
 These definitions are discussed in detail in the MOU.
 The MOU divides antimicrobial pesticides into two two
 categories based on label claims and medical device use patterns.
 The first category is liquid chemical germicides used as as
 sterilants to reprocess reusable critical and semi-critical semi-critical
 devices such as heat labile instruments, and endoscopes.
 The The
 second category is general purpose disinfectants.
 The products products
 Page 2 of 15 15
 Pesticide Regulation (PR) Notice 94-4 94-4
 in this second category are used on non-critical surfaces and and
 dental and medical equipment surfaces such as wheel chairs, chairs,
 dental chairs, and medical beds in hospitals and related related
 institutions.
 These products can be used for pre-cleaning or or
 decontamination of critical or semi-critical surfaces as long as as
 the label clearly states that this is done prior to the surface surface
 being sterilized or disinfected.
 Because of their intended use use
 pattern, these two categories of antimicrobial pesticides are are
 considered to be medical devices and are thus subject to the the
 conditions of this Notice.
 111.
 Background Background
 Liquid chemical germicides which bear claims for use on on
 medical devices are currently regulated both as pesticides under under
 the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (FIFRA)
 and as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Cosmetic
 Act (FFDCA).
 In an effort to resolve the confusion and burden of of
 dual regulation, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed signed
 on June 4, 1993 between the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (EPA)
 and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 The MOU was amended amended
 on June 20, 1994.
 The objectives of the MOU are to (1) provide a a
 framework under which both Agencies will undertake rulemaking to to
 permanently vest exclusive jurisdiction for certain categories of of
 chemical germicides in one Agency or the other, and (2) serve as as
 interim guidance designed to minimize duplicate regulatory regulatory
 requirements in shared areas of jurisdiction between the two two
 Agencies until the rulemaking is complete.
 To briefly summarize the MOU, each Agency has been given given
 primary jurisdiction over one of the two categories of liquid liquid
 chemical germicides considered to be medical devices.
 FDA has has
 primary responsibility over liquid chemical sterilants, which which
 includes responsibility for subordinate claims on sterilant sterilant
 products such as tuberculocidal or virucidal claims which support support
 a high level disinfectant use pattern.
 EPA has primary primary
 jurisdiction over the general purpose disinfectants.
 The MOU MOU
 calls for both EPA and FDA to initiate rulemaking to give each each
 Agency sole jurisdiction over their designated categories.
 However, since rulemaking may involve a long term process, the the
 MOU sets forth interim procedures in order to reduce the the
 condition of dual regulatory oversight.
 The MOU itself cannot change the statutory responsibilities responsibilities
 granted under FIFRA and FFDCA.
 Therefore, until rulemaking is is
 finalized, both Agencies will continue to share jurisdiction over over
 all liquid chemical germicides used on medical devices and will will
 continue to maintain separate registration and premarket approval approval
 procedures.
 In addition, the June 1993 MOU and this PR Notice Notice
 have no affect on EPA's authority to take actions based on test test
 results from the ongoing EPA antimicrobial testing program.
 EPA EPA
 will still act to remove~inefficacious products from the market market
 based on test results from that program.
 Products so removed removed
 from the market, hoyever, must, in addition to meeting other other
 applicable requirements, follow the procedures outlined in the the
 MOU and this PR Notice before they may return to the market.
 Although both Agencies must continue to fulfill their their
 statutory responsibilities, the MOU attempts to alleviate the the
 regulatory burden that may be associated with submitting submitting
 duplicate data packages to both EPA and FDA.
 Essentially, the the
 interim procedures state that only one Agency needs to review the the
 product performance (efficacy) data which are required to support support
 both an EPA registration and an FDA 510(k) premarket clearance.
 Pesticide Regulation (PR) Notice 94-4 Page 3 of 15 15
 The MOU states that the FDA review and acceptance of efficacy efficacy
 data submitted in support of a 510(k) notice will meet EPA's EPA's
 product performance (efficacy) registration requirements for for
 liquid chemical sterilant products.
 Likewise, the EPA review of of
 product performance (efficacy) data submitted for a general general
 purpose disinfectant will suffice for a 510(k) premarket approval approval
 notice.
 Each Agency will continue to administer any other other
 applicable requirements.
 Interim Procedures for Obtaining or Amending an EPA EPA
 IV.
 Registration for Liquid Chemical Sterilant Products Products
 As stated in the previous section, FDA will ultimately be be
 responsible for the sole regulation of liquid chemical sterilant sterilant
 products used to reprocess critical and semi-critical devices.
 FDA will also be solely responsible for the subordinate claims on on
 particular sterilant product labels which support a high level level
 disinfectant use pattern including the hospital disinfectant, disinfectant,
 tuberculocidal, and virucidal claims.
 The FDA efficacy and and
 product performance requirements for 510(k) clearance are are
 comparable to EPA's FIFRA Section 3 efficacy registration registration
 requirements as listed in the Product Performance Guidelines Guidelines
 Subdivision G.
 Therefore, under the interim provisions of the the
 MOU, EPA will agree that the FDA review and acceptance of the the
 efficacy and product performance data will fulfill EPA's product product
 performance (efficacy) registration requirements under FIFRA.
 The following step-by-step procedure describes the EPA EPA
 interim registration process for liquid chemical sterilants and and
 additional product claims which support a high level disinfectant disinfectant
 use pattern for both new registrations and amendments to current current
 registrations.
 The registrant will submit its registration registration
 package to EPA and FDA at the same time so that both Agencies can can
 conduct concurrent reviews.
 1.
 Registrant prepares the full EPA registration package package
 including all toxicology, chemistry, ecological ecological
 effects, and environmental fate data, proposed proposed
 labeling, and associated administrative forms.
 .
 Efficacy/product performance data should not be be
 included in this package.
 Registrant submits the EPA registration package to EPA EPA
 2.
 for review.
 EPA will review this application application
 concurrent with FDA's assessment of the 510(k) 510(k)
 premarket clearance package.
 3.
 Registrant prepares the full FDA 510(k) premarket premarket
 clearance package.
 All efficacy/product performance performance
 data will be included in this package and reviewed by by
 FDA.
 Once the efficacy/product performance data have have
 been reviewed and accepted by FDA, they will satisfy satisfy
 the EPA efficacy/product performance registration data data
 requirements.
 FDA may have additional requirements requirements
 beyond EPA's current requirements.
 These data data
 requirements and label/label insert requirements are are
 published in FDA's Guidance on the Content and Format Format
 of Premarket Notification [510(k)] Submissions for for
 Liquid Chemical Germicides, January 31, 1992.
 Registrant submits the 510(k) premarket clearance clearance
 4.
 package to FDA.
 Once FDA has completed its review, a a
 copy of the FDA accepted labeling and 510(k) clearance clearance
 will be transmitted by FDA to EPA.
 Pesticide Regulation (PR) Notice 94-4 Page 4 of 15 15
 Once EPA has received a copy of the 510(k) clearance clearance
 5.
 from FDA and has completed the review of the FIFRA FIFRA
 application package, the registration or amendment will will
 be granted if EPA determines that registration or or
 amendment is appropriate.
 EPA will include all all
 comments from EPA and/or FDA regarding the proposed proposed
 labeling in the acceptance letter and all required required
 corrections or additions must be incorporated into the the
 final label before the registered product may be be
 legally released for shipment or sold or distributed.
 As currently required, five copies of the final printed printed
 labeling must be submitted to EPA.
 Interim Procedures for Obtaining or Amending an EPA EPA
 V.
 Registration for General Purpose Disinfectants Disinfectants
 Once rulemaking is complete, EPA will have sole jurisdiction jurisdiction
 for general purpose disinfectants.
 The process and requirements requirements
 to register general purpose disinfectants with the EPA will be be
 the same as they are now, including the requirements for for
 efficacy, toxicology, and chemistry data.
 Current EPA label label
 requirements remain in effect.
 However, in order to remain in in
 compliance with FIFRA, the following restrictive label statement statement
 must be added to the label of any general purpose disinfectant disinfectant
 that is registered for any medical device or med.ica1 equipment equipment
 surface claims:
 "This product is not to be used as a terminal terminal
 sterilant/high level disinfectant on any surface or or
 instrument that (1) is introduced directly into the the
 human body, either into or in contact with the the
 bloodstream or normally sterile areas of the body, or or
 (2) contacts intact mucous membranes but which does not not
 ordinarily penetrate the blood barrier or otherwise otherwise
 enter normally sterile areas of the body.
 This product product
 may be used to preclean or decontaminate critical or or
 semi-critical medical devices prior to sterilization or or
 high level disinfection".
 Label Revision Compliance Dates and Procedures Procedures
 VI.
 For products bearing sterilization claims, existing EPA EPA
 labeling requirements remain in effect.
 FDA will promulgate a a
 final rule establishing sole jurisdiction over such products.
 However, to comply with FDA's 510(k) requirements, registrants registrants
 generally will be required to develop a package insert which .
 clearly prescribes the steps to be followed in achieving high, high,
 intermediate, and low level disinfection, as well as provides provides
 other appropriate information.
 Registrants are reminded that that
 this package insert becomes labeling under FIFRA and must comply comply
 with EPA labeling requirements at 40 CFR 156.10.
 For general purpose disinfectants, EPA has determined that that
 the incorporation of the label statement set forth in Section V V
 above must take place as described below.

 Liquid Chemical Germicides Intended for Use on Medical Devices Devices
 I.
 PURPOSE PURPOSE
 This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Food and Drug Drug
 Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency Agency
 (EPA) clarifies jurisdiction between the two agencies in the the
 regulation of certain liquid chemical germicides.
 These liquid liquid
 chemical germicides are devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and and
 Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and pesticides under the Federal Federal
 Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
 This MOU MOU
 also embodies the agreement of the two agencies to undertake undertake
 certain rulemakings in order to eliminate duplicative regulation regulation
 of certain types of liquid chemical germicides.
 This MOU MOU
 includes the agencies' interim agreement to simplify and and
 coordinate their regulatory and enforcement activities in shared shared
 areas of jurisdiction affecting these types of products pending pending
 the conclusion of these rulemakings.

 STATUTORY AUTHORITIES AUTHORITIES
 A.
 FDA Authorities Authorities
 The FD&C Act grants FDA authority to regulate devices as defined defined
 in 21 U.S.C.
 0321(h).
 Under section 321(h), the term "device" "device"
 includes an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, machine,
 .
 contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or or
 related article, including any component, part, or accessory that that
 is intended to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease in man, man,
 or is intended to affect the structure or any function of the the
 body of man.
 Liquid chemical germicides intended for use in in
 conjunction with a variety of articles that fit within the the
 statutory definition of!~"device," such as operating instruments, instruments,
 medical examining tables, hospital scales, and other hospital hospital
 equipment, also fall within the definition of "deviceN because because
 they are considered accessories to these devices.
 Unless liquid chemical germicides used in conjunction with with
 devices were commercially distributed prior to May 28, 1976,l 1976,l
 manufacturers of these products, under 21 U.S.C.
 0360(k) [section [section
 510(k) of the FD&C Act] are required to submit a premarket premarket
 notification to FDA before they market their products.
 Before Before
 these products can be legally marketed, FDA must grant marketing marketing
 clearance by (1) issuance of an order in response to a section section
 510(k) submission which exempts the device from the FD&C Act's Act's
 premarket approval requirements, or (2) approval of a premarket premarket
 Pesticide Regulation (PR) Notice 94-4 Page 7 of 15 15
 approval application.
 In granting marketing clearance by by
 issuance of a section 510(k) order exempting a liquid chemical chemical
 germicide from premarket approval, FDA must find that the device device
 is "substantially equivalent," as the term is defined in 21 21
 U.S.C.
 0360c(i)(l)(A), to a predicate device that does not not
 require premarket approval.
 Section 513 of the FD&C Act Act
 authorizes FDA to exempt products from premarket notification notification
 requirements for which there is a reasonable assurance of safety safety
 and effectiveness.
 At present, no chemical germicides that are are
 used with devices have been exempted from premarket notification notification
 requirements.
 In regulating liquid chemical germicides used with devices, FDA FDA
 is exercising its responsiblilities under the FD&C Act for for
 ensuring that devices are safe and effective for their intended intended
 uses.
 The FD&C Act provides enforcement authority to FDA to to
 pursue regulatory actions, including seizure, injunction, injunction,
 prosecution, and civil penalties.
 EPA Authorities Authorities
 B.
 Liquid chemical germicides, including those regulated as devices, devices,
 are also under the authority of the EPA under FIFRA.
 Before a a
 pesticide product may be lawfully sold or distributed in in
 commerce, the product must be registered by EPA pursuant to FIFRA FIFRA
 section 3, or otherwise exempted from the requirements of FIFRA.
 A registration is a license allowing a pesticide product to be be
 sold and distributed for specified uses in accordance with with
 specified use instructions, precautions, and other terms and and
 conditions.
 Liquid chemical sterilants are included among the the
 various types of antimicrobial products that are currently currently
 subject to FIFRA.
 1/ Devices marketed prior to May 28, 1976 are grandfathered from from
 the FD&C Act's prernarket notification requirements.
 Neither FDA FDA
 nor EPA are aware of any currently marketed products that are are
 exempt under this grandfather provision.
 Should any exist, they they
 are not covered by this Memorandum of Understanding.
 A pesticide product may be registered or remain registered only only
 if it meets the statutory standard for registration.
 Among other other
 things, a pesticide must perform its intended pesticidal function function
 without causing "unreasonable adverse effects on the environment" environment"
 (FIFRA section 3(c)(5)).
 "Unreasonable adverse effects on the the
 environment" is defined as "any unreasonable risk to man or the the
 environment, taking into account the economic, social, and and
 environmental costs and benefits of the use of [the] pesticide" pesticide"
 (FIFRA section 2 (bb) .
 $- $-
 ) )
 The burden of demonstrating that a pesticide product satisfies satisfies
 the statutory criteria for registration is at all times on the the
 proponents of initial or continued registration.
 FIFRA section 6 6
 provides EPA with various regulatory tools that the Administrator Administrator
 may use if it appears that the product no longer satisfies the the
 statutory criteria for registration.
 If appropriate, EPA may may
 require modifications to the terms and conditions of of
 registration, such as deletion of particular uses or revisions to to
 labeling, as an alternative to regulatory outcomes such as as
 cancellation, suspension, or emergency suspension.
 FIFRA also also
 provides enforcement authority to EPA to pursue actions, actions,
 Pesticide Regulation (PR)Notice 94-4 Page 8 of 15 15
 including issuance of stop sale, use, or removal orders when when
 there is reason to believe a pesticide is in violation of FIFRA.
 Additionally, E P has authority to seek the assessment of civil civil
 P.
 administrative penalties as well as institute seizure and and
 criminal actions for violations of FIFRA.
 FIFRA section 25(b) authorizes the Administrator to exempt exempt
 pesticides from FIFRA through regulation if the Administrator Administrator
 determines that the pesticide is "adequately regulated by another another
 Federal agency" or is "of a character which it is unnecessary to to
 be subject to this Act in order to carry out the purposes of this this
 Act.

 REGULATORY RESPONSIBILITIES AND DEFINITIONS DEFINITIONS
 For the purposes of this agreement, liquid chemical germicides germicides
 that are used in conjunction with medical devices are divided divided
 into two product categories:
 (1) sterilants and (2) general general
 purpose disinfectants.
 Sterilants, for purposes of this this
 agreement, means those chemical germicides used to reprocess reprocess
 reusable critical and semicritical devices2.
 Critical devices devices
 are devices that are introduced directly into the human body, body,
 either into or in contact with the bloodstream or normally normally
 sterile areas of the body.
 These critical devices must be be
 sterile.
 2/ This definition is consistent with the definition of these these
 terms used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Prevention
 (CDC).
 Block, S.S.
 1991.
 Disinfection, Sterilizaton, and and
 Preservation.
 4th Edition.
 Philadelphia, Lea & Febiger.
 Semicritical devices are those which contact intact mucous mucous
 membranes but which do not ordinarily penetrate the blood barrier barrier
 or otherwise enter normally sterile areas of the body.
 For these these
 devices, sterilization is desirable but not mandatory.
 These These
 devices must be subjected at least to a high level disinfection3 disinfection3
 process using a sterilant, but for a shorter time than that that
 required for sterilization.
 The second category of liquid chemical germicides are general, general,
 purpose disinfectants.
 General purpose disinfectants, for for
 purposes of this agreement, means those chemical germicides used used
 to reprocess noncritical devices and medical equipment surfaces4.
 Noncritical devices and medical equipment surfaces must be be
 subjected to intermediate or low level disinfection5.
 FDA's priority is to confirm the efficacy and safety of of
 sterilants used to reprocess critical and semicritical devices devices
 which pose the greatest risk of disease transmission.
 This This
 includes assuring that they do not adversely affect device device
 performance or pose a hazard to the patient/user.
 Historically, Historically,
 EPA has assessed the effdctive performance of all chemical chemical
 germicides and addressed health and safety issues presented by by
 their use.
 The FD&C Act and FIFRA have overlapping regulatory schemes for for
 liquid chemical germicides used on devices.
 The objective of of
 this MOU is to minimize redundant regulation of these products by by
 FDA and EPA while assuring that the safety and efficacy efficacy
 requirements of both statutes are met.
 This affects three areas:
 data requirements for obtaining approval, procedures for for
 obtaining approval, and compliance.

 terms of art used by the public health community.
 FDA recognizes recognizes
 "high level disinfectant" as a separate or subcategory of of
 sterilants.
 EPA does not register "high level disinfectants" as as
 separate antimicrobial pesticides, but instead may register uses uses
 of germicides that correspond with uses in FDA's "high level level
 disinfection" category.
 This definition is consistent with the definition of the term term
 4/ 4/
 used by CDC.
 51 "Low and intermediate level disinfectants" are terms of art art
 used by the public health community.
 FDA recognizes "low and and
 intermediate level disinfection" as subcategories of general general
 purpose disinfectants.
 EPA does not register low level and and
 intermediate level disinfectants, but has corresponding germicide germicide
 classes.
 In determining whether the FD&C Act's and FIFRA's statutory and and
 regulatory requirements are met, EPA and FDA will utilize the the
 data requirements and performance standards referenced in FDA's FDA's
 current Guidance on the Content and Format of Premarket Premarket
 Notification Submission for Liquid Chemical Germicides, FDA FDA
 premarket notification regulations at 21 CFR Part 807, Subpart E, E,
 EPA data requirements regulations at 40 CFR Part 158, and EPA's EPA's
 Subdivision G I Product Performance Guidelines.
 Since the EPA registration requirements for general purpose purpose
 disinfectants parallel the requirements necessary to receive receive
 marketing clearance for general purpose disinfectants under under
 section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, fulfillment of EPA's registration registration
 requirements fulfills FDA's section 510(k) requirements for those those
 products.
 The EPA efficacy data requirements for liquid chemical chemical
 sterilants, including those with high level disinfectant uses, uses,
 are fulfilled by FDA's section 510(k) requirements or premarket premarket
 approval requirements.
 Therefore, premarket clearance by FDA FDA
 fulfills certain EPA registration requirements for liquid liquid
 chemical sterilants, insofar as efficacy and product performance performance
 are concerned.
 FDA premarket clearance does not satisfy EPA's EPA's
 chemistry, toxicology, and ecological effects requirements.

 AGREEMENT AGREEMENT
 The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the the
 Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration agree that until until
 exemptions referred to in Section V occur, the following division division
 of responsibility will govern the activities of the agencies in in
 the regulation of liquid chemical germicides that are intended intended
 for use on devices:

 1.
 FDA will be primarily responsible for the premarket review review
 of safety and efficacy requirements for liquid chemical chemical
 germicides that are sterilants6 intended for use on critical critical
 or semicritical devices.
 Examples of critical devices are are
 laparoscopes, surgical instruments, heart-lung oxygenators, oxygenators,
 and transfer forceps.
 Examples of semicritical devices are are
 gastrointestinal endoscopes, endotracheal tubes, tubes,
 cystoscopes, anesthesia breathing circuits, and vaginal vaginal
 specula.
 FDA will also be primarily responsible for for
 premarket review of contact lens solutions.

 stethoscopes.
 3.
 FDA marketing clearance through the section 510(k) process process
 or approval through the premarket approval process of of
 sterilants will satisfy certain requirements for for
 registration under FIFRA Section 3.
 Upon submission to EPA EPA
 by the applicant of an order issued by FDA granting granting
 marketing clearance or approval for a liquid chemical chemical
 germicide that is a sterilant, EPA will consider the the
 efficacy data requirements for registration to be satisfied, satisfied,
 and will promptly determine whether the other requirements requirements
 for registration are satisfied.

 Upon Upon
 receipt of this information from the manufacturer of a a
 liquid chemical germicide in this category, FDA will issue issue
 an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a a
 predicate device that does not require premarket approval.
 This order will allow the device to be legally marketed marketed
 without an approved FDA premarket approval application.
 7/ Procedures described in Paragraph 4 only apply to liquid liquid
 chemical germicide products that do not contain any sterilant, sterilant,
 claims.
 If a liquid chemical germicide product contains contains
 both sterilant and general purpose disinfectant claims, claims,
 registration will proceed according to the procedures described described
 in Paragraph 3.
 If the registrant of a general purpose purpose
 disinfectant product registered by EPA subsequently applies for for
 registration of a sterilant claim, registration of that product product
 must proceed under procedures described in Paragraph 3 and the the
 existing EPA registration will become void upon FDA's clearance clearance
 of the product.
 As part of the EPA registration process, EPA will require require

 requirements and product performance standards for liquid liquid
 chemical sterilants are fulfilled by FDA's section 510(k) 510(k)
 requirements or premarket approval requirements.
 When such such
 exemption becomes effective, FDA and EPA will cease to follow follow
 procedures described in Paragraph IV, A.3.
 and these products products
 will be subject solely to the regulatory and enforcement enforcement
 requirements and procedures of FDA, and EPA will no longer longer
 register such products.
 To the extent EPA receives information information
 regarding such products, it will share such information with FDA.

 chemical germicides used on devices under section 513 of the FD&C FD&C
 Act.
 FDA believes that EPA's requirements under FIFRA for liquid liquid
 chemical germicides that are intended for use on medical devices devices
 that are not critical or semicritical devices parallel the FD&C FD&C
 Act's requirements under section 510(k) of the Act.
 Accordingly, FDA will recommend to its classification advisory advisory
 panel that liquid chemical germicides intended for use on devices devices
 that are not critical or semicritical devices be exempted from from
 premarket notification requirements under section 510(k) of the the

 PURPOSE PURPOSE
 This amendment to the June 4, 1993 Memorandum of of
 Understanding (MOU) between the Food and Drug Administration Administration
 (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revises the the
 disclaimer statement required to appear on the labels of all all
 liquid chemical germicid&, other than sterilants that have have
 received FDA premarket clearance or approval.
 11.
 BACKGROUND BACKGROUND
 On June 4, 1993, a MOU was signed between FDA and EPA as an an
 interim measure to abolishing dual regulation of liquid chemical chemical
 germicides.
 Under the MOU liquid chemical germicides, considered considered
 to be medical devices, are divided into two product categories:
 (1) sterilants and (2) general purpose disinfectants.
 FDA has has
 primary jurisdiction over germicides with sterilant claims.
 This This
 jurisdiction includes sterilant products which also bear bear
 subordinate tuberculocidal or virucidal claims supporting their their
 Pesticide Regulation (PR) Notice 94-4 Page 14 of 15 15
 use pattern as a high level disinfectant.
 EPA has primary primary
 jurisdiction over the general purpose disinfectants.
 Under the the
 MOU, both FDA and EPA are required to initiate rulemaking so as as
 to give each Agency sole jurisdiction over its assigned category.
 Until the rulemakings take effect, the MOU sets forth interim interim
 procedures designed to ease any possible regulatory burden that that
 was associated with the submission of duplicate data packages to to
 the Agencies.
 Among other things, the MOU specified label language to be be
 placed on labels of certain liquid chemical germicides.
 For the the
 reasons explained below, this amendment substitutes new language language
 for that originally specified in the MOU.
 111.
 AMENDMENT AMENDMENT
 A.
 Background Background
 The existing label language specified in Paragraph IV(A) (5) (5)
 of the MOU, which must appear on the labels of liquid chemical chemical
 germicides other than sterilants that have received FDA FDA
 premarketing clearance or approval, is:
 "This product is not to be used on any surface or instrument instrument
 that (1) is introduced directly into the human body, either either
 into or in contact with the bloodstream or normally sterile sterile
 areas of the body, or (2) contacts intact mucous membranes membranes
 but which does not ordinarily penetrate the blood barrier or or
 otherwise enter normally sterile areas of the body." body."
 Since the MOU was signed, it has been brought to EPA's and and
 FDA's attention that the present label disclaimer does not allow allow
 for the use of general purpose disinfectants as a precleaner for for
 the removal of gross filth on medical devices prior to their their
 sterilization.
 Included under the "DIRECTIONS FOR USE" on the the
 label of sterilant products, is a statement requiring the the
 thorough cleaning, rinsing, and drying of medical instruments and and
 equipment prior to disinfection and sterilization.
 This This
 amendment only serves to revise the disclaimer statement statement
 currently required on the labels of all liquid chemical chemical
 germicides, other than sterilants.
 The revised label disclaimer disclaimer
 statement will allow the use of general purpose disinfectants on on
 medical devices, as a precleaner, prior to sterilization.
 B.
 Amended Language Language
 Paragraph IV(A) (5) of the June 4, 1993 Memorandum of of
 Understanding between the Food and Drug Administration, Public Public
 Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services, and the the
 Environmental Protection Agency is amended by striking the entire entire
 text of Paragraph IV(A) (5) and replacing it with the following:
 t t
 As part of the EPA ;egistration process, EPA will require require
 registrants of liquid chemical germicides, other than sterilants sterilants
 that have received FDA premarketing clearance or approval, to put put
 the following statement :on their product labels:
 "This product is not to be used as a terminal terminal

 Disinfectants and antiseptics are germicidal solutions, also known as sanitizers and antimicrobials, and are used to quickly kill bacteria on contact.
 The difference between the two is that disinfectants are used to kill bacteria on objects and surfaces while antiseptics are used to kill bacteria on skin or living tissue.
 Disinfectants and antiseptics are used everywhere from hospitals to homes to destroy harmful microorganisms.
 1.
 Different Types of Disinfectants Disinfectants
 * *
 Different types of disinfectants include alcohols, aldehydes, bleaches, hydrogen peroxide, iodine and potassium permanganate solution.
 Phenol compounds, which are disinfectants used in hand-washes and soaps, are also used for their anti-bacterial properties.
 Use of Disinfectants Disinfectants
 * *
 Disinfectants are used in many different places such as in hospitals, clinics, homes, schools and offices.
 They are used to clean surfaces such as toilets, sinks, floors, drains, door knobs, counters and garbage cans.
 Disinfectants aid in maintaining a clean environment to help prevent the spread of harmful bacteria that may cause infections.
 Different Types of Antiseptics Antiseptics
 * *
 Different types of antiseptics include alcohol, boric acid, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, carbolic acid, chlorohexadine, sodium chloride, sodium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite.
 Additionally, phenol compounds are also used as antiseptics such as in mouthwashes.
 Use of Antiseptics Antiseptics
 * *
 Antiseptics are applied to the skin either to sterilize a cut or used for hand-washing such as before a surgical procedure or contact with those who are at a high risk of infection such as newborn babies.
 Antiseptics destroy and inhibit the growth of microorganisms on the skin or mucous membranes.
 They are not as strong as disinfectants, so they shouldn't be used to clean objects and surfaces.
 Regulatory Agencies Agencies
 * *
 The use of disinfectants is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Pesticides.
 They require manufacturers to test the product's stability, toxicity to humans and microbial activity before being distributed and sold.
 Germicides that are used in the medical environment are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 Specific information about microbial activity is submitted by the manufacturers before being distributed and sold.
 The FDA also regulates the use of antimicrobial soaps, scrubs and wound protectors.
 Germicidal Effectiveness Effectiveness
 * *
 The effectiveness of germicides is based on a number of factors.
 Such factors include the shape of the object being cleaned, its texture and whether it is flat or cracked.
 The amount of microbes and the resistance of these microbes to the germicide also play a part in its effectiveness.
 The amount of blood, mucus or tissue on the skin affects the effectiveness of antiseptics, as do the chemical composition, time of exposure and temperature of the germicide.
 It is for this reason that germicidal solutions should be used for its specific purpose and used properly based on the manufacturer's instructions.

 * Regulating Antimicrobial Pesticides Pesticides
 Antimicrobial pesticides are substances or mixtures of substances used to destroy or suppress the growth of harmful microorganisms whether bacteria, viruses, or fungi on inanimate objects and surfaces.
 Antimicrobial products contain about 275 different active ingredients and are marketed in several formulations:
 sprays, liquids, concentrated powders, and gases.
 Today, approximately one billion dollars each year are spent on a variety of different types of antimicrobial products.
 More than 5000 antimicrobial products are currently registered with the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and sold in the marketplace.
 Nearly 60% of antimicrobial products are registered to control infectious microorganisms in hospitals and other health care environments.
 Major Uses Uses
 Antimicrobial pesticides have two major uses:
 1.
 disinfect, sanitize, reduce, or mitigate growth or development of microbiological organisms; organisms;
 2.
 protect inanimate objects (for example floors and walls), industrial processes or systems, surfaces, water, or other chemical substances from contamination, fouling, or deterioration caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, algae, or slime.
 These uses do not include certain pesticides intended for food use; but do encompass pesticides with a wide array of other uses.
 For example:
 * antimicrobial pesticides act as preserving agents in paints, metalworking fluids, wood supports, and many other products to prevent their deterioration.
 Some examples of antimicrobial pesticide chemicals can be found by referring to the Antimicrobial Testing Program (ATP) web page.
 Types of Antimicrobial Products Products
 Antimicrobial products are divided into two categories based on the type of microbial pest against which the product works:
 Non-public health products are used to control growth of:
 * algae, algae,
 * odor-causing bacteria, bacteria,
 * bacteria which cause spoilage, deterioration or fouling of materials and microorganisms infectious only to animals.
 This general category includes products used in:
 o cooling towers towers
 o jet fuel fuel
 o paints paints
 o treatments for textile and paper products.
 Public health products are intended to control microorganisms infectious to humans in any inanimate environment.
 The more commonly used public health antimicrobial products include the following:
 * Sterilizers (Sporicides):
 Used to destroy or eliminate all forms of microbial life including:
 o fungi, fungi,
 o viruses, viruses,
 o all forms of bacteria and their spores.
 Spores are considered to be the most difficult form of microorganism to destroy.
 Therefore, EPA considers the term Sporicide to be synonymous with "Sterilizer." "Sterilizer."
 Sterilization is critical to infection control and is widely used in hospitals on medical and surgical, instruments and equipment.
 Types of sterilizers include:
 o steam under pressure (autoclaving) (autoclaving)
 o dry heat ovens (used primarily for sterilization of medical instruments) instruments)
 o low temperature gas (ethylene oxide) (used primarily for sterilization of medical instruments) instruments)
 o liquid chemical sterilants (used primarily for delicate instruments which cannot withstand high temperature and gases).
 * Disinfectants:
 Used on hard inanimate surfaces and objects to destroy or irreversibly inactivate infectious fungi and bacteria but not necessarily their spores.
 Disinfectant products are divided into two major types:
 o hospital type disinfectants are the most critical to infection control and are used on:
 + medical and dental instruments instruments
 + floors, walls walls
 + bed linens linens
 + toilet seats, and other surfaces surfaces
 o general use disinfectants are the major source of products used in:
 + households households
 + swimming pools pools
 + water purifiers.
 * Sanitizers:
 Used to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, microorganisms from the inanimate environment to levels considered safe as determined by public health codes or regulations.
 Sanitizers include:
 o food contact products - These products are important because they are used on sites where consumable food products are placed and stored.
 Sanitizing rinses for surfaces such as:
 + dishes and cooking utensils utensils
 + equipment and utensils found in:
 # dairies dairies
 # food-processing plants plants
 # eating and drinking establishments establishments
 o non-food contact products - Non-food contact surface sanitizers include:
 + carpet sanitizers sanitizers
 + air sanitizers sanitizers
 + laundry additives additives
 + in-tank toilet bowl sanitizers.
 * Antiseptics and Germicides:
 Used to prevent infection and decay by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms.
 Because these products are used in or on living humans or animals, they are considered drugs and are thus approved and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 What are Antimicrobial Pesticides?
 Did you know many antimicrobial products are considered pesticides?
 Because they are designed to kill pests, specifically germs or microorganisms, they are considered pesticides.
 Antimicrobials come in a wide variety of forms including toilet bowl sanitizers, swimming pool chemicals and bleach.
 Antimicrobial pesticides are important tools in public health because we use them in hospitals, schools, bathrooms and food preparation areas to prevent the spread of germs that cause diseases.
 Antimicrobial pesticides are categorized based on the type of microbial pest for which they were designed to be effective.
 Some products are intended to control the growth of pests like algae or odor-causing bacteria that do not pose a threat to human health.
 Other products are designed specifically to sanitize, disinfect or sterilize surfaces of microbes that are potentially harmful such as those in blood or bodily fluids.

 * Antimicrobials for Pathogens in Blood and Body Fluids (Influenza, MRSA, HIV) HIV)
 * Antimicrobials for Food Processing, Pools and Drinking Water Systems Systems
 * Toxicology and Health Effects of Antimicrobials Antimicrobials
 Note:
 Some similar products are not antimicrobial pesticides! Some antimicrobial products are used to prevent infection by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms within or on living things.
 Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are one example.
 These products are considered drugs and they are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 If the product label includes an EPA registration number, then EPA regulates the product.
 If the product label includes "Drug Facts" then FDA regulates the product.
 If the product label doesn't contain either of these elements, it may be a cleaner.
 Neither the EPA nor the FDA regulate cleaners because they do not claim to kill any pest or prevent any disease.

 Abstract Abstract
 Data concerning the concentration of dioxins (PCDD/PCDFs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), metals, metalloids, pesticides and antimicrobials residues are reported for the edible portion of Australian wild and farmed southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii).
 In 2004 wild caught (n = 5) and farmed (n = 26) southern bluefin tuna (SBT) were collected.
 The mean concentration of total mercury on a fresh weight (fw) basis was 0.34 mg/kg in wild SBT and 0.31 mg/kg in farmed SBT.
 Concentrations of dioxins (PCDD/PCDFs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) found in wild SBT were extremely low.
 The mean concentration (fw) of the sum of PCDD/PCDFs and the dioxin-like PCBs was 0.27 pg TEQ/g in wild SBT and 0.61 pg TEQ/g in farmed SBT.
 Mean PCB total concentration (fw basis) was 0.47 ng/g in wild SBT and 6.60 ng/g in farmed SBT.
 No detectable residues of any pesticide or antimicrobial compounds were found.
 All residues detected were within regulatory limits set by the Japanese Competent Authority, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) and the Australian Competent Authority, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ).
 The need for harmonisation of international product integrity procedures for bluefin tunas in international trade is highlighted.

 ﻿EPA Proposes New Data Requirements for Antimicrobial Pesticide Products Products
 Beveridge & Diamond, P.C.
 - Client Alert, November 10, 2008 2008
 On October 8, 2008, the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed revisions to its data requirements for antimicrobial pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), in conjunction with its wider effort to update and streamline its data requirements for all pesticides.
 A full copy of the proposed requirements for antimicrobial products is available in the Federal Register at 73 Fed.
 Reg.
 59382 (Oct.
 8, 2008).
 While the proposal largely retains the Agency’s current data requirements for antimicrobials, it establishes 12 new use patterns specific to antimicrobial pesticides intended to make it easier for applicants to determine which data requirements apply to particular types of antimicrobial products.
 The proposal also incorporates nine new data requirements for antimicrobial pesticides, including four new requirements intended for use in a screening-level assessment on the fate of antimicrobials with the potential to reach a wastewater treatment plant.
 These products would include “down-the-drain” products as well as microbiocides used in industrial process and water systems.
 EPA is accepting comments on its proposal until January 6, 2009.
 Affected parties, including pesticide product manufacturers, antimicrobial pesticide and microbiocide registrants, and wastewater treatment plant operators seeking more information about the Agency’s regulation of antimicrobial pesticide products or the implications of EPA’s proposed changes should contact Kathy Szmuszkovicz at (202) 789-6037 (kszmuszkovicz@bdlaw.com), Karen Hansen at (202) 789-6056 (khansen@bdlaw.com), or Alan Sachs at (410) 230-1345 (asachs@bdlaw.com).
 A.
 Background Background
 Pursuant to FIFRA, every pesticide product must be registered by EPA before it may be sold or distributed in the United States.
 An application for a pesticide registration must demonstrate that the product will not cause “unreasonable adverse effects” to humans or the environment.
 To evaluate proposed product registrations or new uses of existing pesticides pursuant to this standard, FIFRA provides EPA with broad authority to require from pesticide applicants and registrants scientific data concerning each product, including its composition, toxicity, potential human exposure, environmental properties, and ecological effects.
 EPA first promulgated general data requirements for pesticides in 1984, at 40 C.F.R.
 Part 158.
 Antimicrobial pesticide applicants have frequently found it difficult to determine which of the Agency’s pesticide data requirements apply to their products, resulting in the need for unusually extensive consultation with EPA before registration and throughout the registration lifecycle.
 One of the Agency’s primary goals in promulgating its new antimicrobial data requirements is to provide clarity to antimicrobial pesticide registrants and reduce the extensiveness of EPA consultations.
 B.
 Applicability Applicability
 EPA’s proposed requirements for antimicrobial products will apply to:
 * “antimicrobial pesticides” as defined by FIFRA (generally, any pesticide intended to (1) disinfect, sanitize, reduce or mitigate growth or development of microbiological organisms, or (2) protect inanimate objects, industrial processes or systems, surfaces, water or other chemical substances from contamination, fouling, or deterioration caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, algae or slime); slime);
 * pesticide products intended for antimicrobial uses in or on food or feed; feed;
 * antifoulant paints and coatings; coatings;
 * wood preservatives; and and
 * pesticide products intended to be manufactured into any of the above.
 The proposed requirements, once final, are intended to apply to all new applications for registration of antimicrobial pesticides submitted after the effective date of the rule.
 EPA also anticipates that the new requirements will apply to applications for antimicrobial pesticides that are undergoing Agency review when the new regulation goes into effect.
 EPA is also considering a limited transition “window” for certain pending antimicrobial registration applications.
 While EPA does not intend to apply the new requirements automatically to all existing pesticide registrations, the Agency notes that it may be necessary to call-in data on certain existing registrations, as warranted by emerging risks of concern for particular pesticides or as a result of possible future programmatic changes and priorities on existing pesticides, or during the registration reviews required by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA).
 EPA also points out that it may be useful for all applicants, potential applicants and registrants of existing products to evaluate their products in light of the proposed requirements.
 The Agency continues to expressly encourage consultation with EPA during the application process.
 C.
 Use Patterns for Antimicrobial Pesticides Pesticides
 Previously, in order to determine applicable data requirements for antimicrobial pesticide products, applicants relied on 12 “use categories” developed by EPA for consideration with antimicrobials.
 By identifying the relevant use category for a specific product, the applicant would be referred to a corresponding Part 158 pesticide “use pattern,” through which the applicant could identify associated data requirements.
 In its proposal, EPA now seeks to promulgate the 12 existing antimicrobial use categories as independent use patterns for antimicrobial pesticides.
 These use patterns are:
 * Agricultural premises and equipment (including many indirect food uses with mostly indoor use sites); sites);
 * Food-handling/storage establishments, premises, and equipment (including many indirect food uses due to the treatment of food contact surfaces and the resultant human exposures); exposures);
 * Commercial, institutional and industrial premises and equipment (including nonfood contact areas of commercial sites); sites);
 * Residential and public access premises (including mostly nonfood areas, as well as food-handling areas in homes); homes);
 * Medical premises and equipment (including uses with the potential for repeated exposure); exposure);
 * Human drinking water systems (including any methods used to provide potable water from raw water supplies, such as public water systems, water purifier units, and private water systems); systems);
 * Material preservatives (including antimicrobial chemicals added to paints, coatings, adhesives, textiles, and paper); paper);
 * Industrial processes and water systems (including microbiocides used to control the growth of bacteria, fungi, and algae in circulating water systems);1 systems);1
 * Antifoulant paints and coatings (including coatings and paints applied to control the growth of freshwater or marine fouling organisms, as well as ballast water); water);
 * Wood preservatives (including products which claim to control wood degradation problems due to fungal rot or decay, sapstain, molds, or wood-destroying insects); insects);
 * Swimming pools (including products used to prevent or control the growth of bacteria or algae in swimming pools, Jacuzzis and hot tubs); and and
 * Aquatic areas (including products designed to control or kill slime-forming bacteria, fungi or algae in lakes, ponds, streams, drainage ditches, or other bodies of water).
 D.
 Summary of EPA’s Proposed Data Requirements for Antimicrobial Pesticides Pesticides
 Under the proposal, EPA’s data requirements for antimicrobial pesticides will be incorporated into Part 158 as a new subpart W.
 1.
 New Data Requirements Requirements
 The proposal includes nine new data requirements for antimicrobial products, including four new requirements that are not generally required for conventional pesticides:
 * Activated sludge sorption isotherm study; study;
 * Ready biodegradability study; study;
 * Porous pot study; and and
 * Modified activated sludge, respiration inhibition test.
 These four new studies are being required because of the “many down-the-drain uses” of antimicrobial pesticides, and their discharge to public treatment systems.
 73 Fed.
 Reg.
 at 59,387.
 In its proposal, EPA explains that because many antimicrobial pesticides are typically rinsed down the drain, it is proposing these four new requirements for use in a screening-level assessment on the fate of antimicrobials that reach a wastewater treatment plant.
 In addition, seven higher-tiered environmental fate studies could be triggered based on a weight-of evidence evaluation of the results of the screening-level studies.
  Consistent with its existing data requirements, EPA requires the applicant to develop product performance data for all products; however, EPA will only require the submission of product performance data from applicants that make a public health claim regarding their product.
  EPA has proposed application of its existing product chemistry data requirements for conventional pesticides to antimicrobial pesticides.
 These chemistry data requirements include data identifying the basic identity and chemical and physical characteristics of a pesticide chemical.
  EPA proposes modifying the application of its toxicology data requirements to reflect the differing risks of levels of exposure to antimicrobials by establishing two new groupings for antimicrobial products:
 “low human exposure” and “high human exposure.” 73 Fed.
  For purposes of determining data requirements, EPA considers high human exposure to include:
 those uses which are likely to result in human exposure over a considerable portion of the human lifespan, and which are significant in terms of frequency, duration, or magnitude of exposure (i.e., uses for which there is an expectation of high, prolonged, or repeated exposure).
  Examples of high human exposure uses of antimicrobials include uses requiring a tolerance or tolerance exemption, indirect food uses with residues equal to or greater than 200 parts per billion, use in human or animal drinking water, outdoor aquatic uses which have the potential to contaminate potable water, and wood preservatives.
 Low human exposure uses are defined as those not meeting the criteria for high exposure uses.
 Under this approach, an application for registration of an antimicrobial with low human exposure might be required to generate fewer studies in total than would be required for high human exposure uses.
  EPA’s proposal would codify its current practice of requiring handler exposure studies for all antimicrobial products whenever the Agency’s toxicity criteria (i.e., evidence of potentially significant adverse effects have been observed in any applicable toxicity studies, or scientifically sound epidemiological or poisoning incident data indicate that adverse health effects may have resulted from handling of the pesticide) and exposure criteria (i.e., dermal or respiratory exposure may occur during use) are triggered.
 In its proposal, EPA seeks to modify the applicability of its existing residue chemistry data requirements to reflect the differing risks and levels of exposure of antimicrobials.
 For example, to determine antimicrobial residue chemistry data requirements, most antimicrobial pesticides will be classified as either direct or indirect food uses.
  EPA has proposed dividing antimicrobial pesticides into two groups for the purpose of determining environmental fate and ecotoxicity data requirements:
 a “low environmental exposure” grouping and a “high environmental exposure” grouping.
  According to the Agency, the potential for environmental exposure is “high” for three of the antimicrobial pesticide use patterns (antifoulant paints and coatings, wood preservatives, and aquatic areas), because these uses either occur outdoors and thus discharge directly to the environment, or result in materials treated with antimicrobials being placed in the environment.
 In addition, EPA includes use in once-through industrial processes and water systems (a subgroup of the industrial processes and water systems use pattern in which the water is not re-used and is released after a single cycle through the system) in its high environmental exposure grouping.
 By contrast, the low environmental exposure grouping includes products with use patterns in agricultural premises, food-handling establishments, medical premises, human drinking water systems, and recirculating industrial processes and water systems.
 As noted above, based on EPA’s concerns about the potential effects of antimicrobials on the biological treatment processes used in wastewater treatment plants -- as well as its concerns about potential bioconcentration of antimicrobials after release and possible effects on nontarget species -- the Agency is also proposing four new environmental fate data requirements to assess all products with “down-the-drain” antimicrobial uses (represented in the proposed rule by the low environmental exposure grouping, as well as once-through industrial processes and water systems).
 These data will allow EPA to conduct screening-level environmental fate assessments, which can then indicate the need for higher-tiered data.
  EPA is proposing to use a tiered system of ecological effects testing to assess the potential risks of pesticide uses to nontarget animals for antimicrobial pesticides.
  EPA is proposing to modify the applicability of its existing nontarget plant protection data requirements to reflect the differing risks and levels of exposure of antimicrobial products.

 Antimicrobials and Antibacterials Antibacterials
 Join the fight to ban triclosan! Beyond Pesticides is leading a campaign to ban the non-medical uses of one of the most prevalent and dangerous antibacterial chemicals on the market:
 triclosan.
 Triclosan has been linked to numerous health and environmental effects, such as antibacterial resistance, endocrine disruption and the contamination of fish, surface and drinking waters.
 Find out more about triclosan and how you can protect yourself and your family by visiting the triclosan page.
 What are antimicrobials?
 Antimicrobials are natural or synthetic substances which kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
 This capability makes antimicrobials unique for the control of deadly infectious diseases caused by a large variety of pathogenic bacteria.
 There are more than 15 different classes of antimicrobials known that differ in chemical structure and mechanism of action.
 They are historically used in medical settings to combat infectious diseases.
 However, over the last 20 years, they have been used increasingly in cosmetics, personal care products, in food processing, on inanimate objects, clothing, and for the treatment of bacterial disease in animals, fish, and plants.
 Antimicrobials are pesticides and must be regulated as such with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in accordance with the Federal Insecticides, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
 There are more than 5000 antimicrobial pesticides registered with the EPA.
 When used in or on the human body, however, antimicrobials are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 Antibacterials Antibacterials
 Even though antimicrobial and antibacterial are often used interchangeably, there are many antimicrobial substances on the market designed to work specifically against bacteria.
 These are known as antibacterials.
 Triclosan - One antibacterial most debated is triclosan.
 Triclosan is a broad spectrum pesticide found is a wide range of consumer products, including soaps and toys.
 Despite its wide-spread use, its health and environmental impacts are only now being studied.
 Triclosan is the focus of a campaign undertaken by a coalition of health and environmental groups led by Beyond Pesticides, aimed at removing triclosan from the market.
 Nanosilver - Another antibacterial agent under scrutiny is silver nanoparticles or nanosilver.
 Silver nanoparticles are also found in a wide range of consumer products like clothing, band-aids, and even washing machines.
 A recent petition submitted by environmental groups call for urgent review of this new technology.
 With an increasing number of scientific studies looking at these antibacterial substances, two basic, yet important, questions arise:
 Are they safe for human health and the environment?
 And are they necessary?
 Acute Antimicrobial Pesticide-Related Illnesses Among Workers in Health-Care Facilities --- California, Louisiana, Michigan, and Texas, 2002--2007 2002--2007
 Weekly Weekly
 May 14, 2010 / 59(18);551-556 59(18);551-556
 Antimicrobial pesticides (e.g., sterilizers, disinfectants, and sanitizers) are chemicals used to destroy or suppress the growth of harmful microorganisms on inanimate objects and surfaces (1).
 Health-care facilities use antimicrobial pesticides to prevent pathogen transmission from contaminated environmental surfaces (2).
 Occupational exposures to antimicrobial pesticides are known to cause adverse health effects.
 To assess the nature and frequency of such exposures in health-care settings, CDC analyzed data from pesticide poisoning surveillance programs in California, Louisiana, Michigan, and Texas (the only four states that regularly collect data on antimicrobial pesticide-related illness) for the period 2002--2007.
 This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which identified 401 cases of work-related illness associated with antimicrobial pesticide exposures in health-care facilities.
 Most cases were identified through workers compensation systems (61%) and occurred among females (82%) and persons aged 25--54 years (73%).
 The most frequent occupations reported were janitors/housekeepers (24%) and nursing/medical assistants (16%).
 The reported mechanism of injury usually was splashes/spills (51%).
 The eyes were the most common organ/system affected (55%); only 15% of the 265 persons who had exposures while handling antimicrobial pesticides reported using eye protection.
 Reported symptoms were mostly mild and temporary.
 One fatality due to acute asthma and subsequent cardiopulmonary collapse was identified.
 Health-care facilities should educate workers about antimicrobial pesticide hazards, promote the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) as appropriate, and implement effective risk communication strategies for antimicrobial pesticide use to prevent bystander exposure.
 Improved design of handling equipment might prevent handler and bystander exposure.
 Approximately 5,000 antimicrobial pesticide products are registered with the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency, and approximately 60% of these are targeted to control infectious microorganisms in health-care settings (1).
 Antimicrobial pesticide products are formulated into sprays, liquids, concentrated powders, and gases (1).
 Occupational exposure to disinfectants (e.g., glutaraldehyde), cleaning products (e.g., bleach), or sanitizers (e.g., quarternary ammonium compounds [QACs]) can cause acute irritant symptoms, respiratory and skin sensitization, and asthma (3--5).
 Although information on the risks for occupational exposure to antimicrobial pesticides is available, little is known about the magnitude and characteristics of acute antimicrobial pesticide illnesses among workers in health-care facilities.
 The four states require health-care providers to report pesticide-related illness to designated state agencies.
 State surveillance programs collect data on acute pesticide illness cases from various sources (e.g., physicians, poison control centers, workers compensation systems, and state and local government agencies) and classify cases based on the strength of evidence for pesticide exposure, health effects, and their causal relationship (6) (Table 1).
 CDC obtained data for the California cases from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR), and data for the other three states from the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR)-Pesticides program.* Case categories of definite, probable, possible, and suspicious from SENSOR-Pesticides and definite, probable, and possible from CDPR were included in the data analysis.
 An antimicrobial pesticide-related illness was defined as any acute adverse health effect resulting from exposure to an antimicrobial pesticide product.
 Health-care facilities were defined as hospitals, nursing and personal-care facilities, medical clinics, and other health service settings involving patient care.† Home health-care services were excluded.
 Data were analyzed for demographics, occupation, health effects, severity,§ outcomes (e.g., hospitalization and lost work time), pesticide toxicity, active ingredients, and nature of exposure (e.g., type of activity, type of exposure, and PPE use).
 During 2002--2007, a total of 401 acute illnesses associated with work-related antimicrobial pesticide exposures in health-care facilities were reported:
 287 cases (72%) in California, 56 (14%) in Texas, 43 (11%) in Michigan, and 15 (4%) in Louisiana (Table 2).
 These antimicrobial pesticide exposure cases accounted for 87% of all work-related pesticide illnesses reported in health-care facilities.
 The annual number of cases increased from 51 in 2002 to 77 in 2007.
 The majority of cases were among females (82%) and persons aged 25--54 years (73%).
 Occupations with the most cases were janitors/housekeepers (24%), followed by nursing/medical assistants (16%) and technicians (15%).
 Most cases (85%) had low-severity illness.
 Fifty-six cases (14%) had moderate-severity illness, two cases had high-severity illness, and one death occurred.
 Eight cases (2%) were hospitalized, and 68 persons (17%) experienced ≥1 day of lost time from work.
 Ocular symptoms/signs (e.g., eye irritation/pain and conjunctivitis) were the most commonly experienced health effects (55%), followed by neurologic (e.g., headache and dizziness) (32%), respiratory (e.g., throat irritation/pain, cough, and dyspnea) (30%), and dermal (e.g., irritation and rash) (24%) symptoms/signs.
 Among the 121 cases with respiratory symptoms/signs, 11 (9%) were in persons with asthma who had acute asthma, and six (5%) were in persons without asthma who experienced wheezing; all 17 were classified with moderate or higher severity illness.
 The fatal case occurred in a woman aged 52 years employed as a laundry worker at a Michigan nursing home who had a 2-year history of non--steroid-dependent asthma and chronic bronchitis.
 She smoked two packs of cigarettes and some marijuana daily.
 In February 2007, she was exposed to nondiluted bleach fumes from an open pail near a running clothes dryer for 10--15 minutes.
 She complained of shortness of breath, used her albuterol inhaler, but collapsed.
 9-1-1 was called, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and intubation were performed at the scene.
 She never regained consciousness and died 5 days later in the hospital.
 The most common active ingredients responsible for illnesses were QACs (38%), glutaraldehyde (25%), and sodium hypochlorite (18%).
 Sixty-six percent of cases were in persons exposed while they handled antimicrobial pesticides and 18% were in bystanders (16% had unknown activity at time of exposure).
 Inadvertent exposure by splashes/spills/leaks accounted for 51% of cases.
 Among 265 persons who handled antimicrobial pesticides, 74% were wearing some type of PPE, including primarily work clothes or gowns (60%) and gloves (55%).
 Only 15% wore eye protection, including safety glasses, goggles, or face shield, and 5% wore surgical masks or respirators.
 Description and Usage Usage
 Antimicrobial agents are substances or mixtures of substances used to destroy or suppress the growth of harmful microorganisms whether bacteria, viruses, or fungi on inanimate objects and surfaces.
 Antimicrobial products contain about 300 different active ingredients and are marketed in several formulations:
 sprays, liquids, concentrated powders, and gases.
 Today, approximately one billion dollar each year are spent on a variety of different types of antimicrobial products.
 More than 8000 antimicrobial products are currently registered with the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and sold in the marketplace.
 Nearly 50% of antimicrobial products are registered to control infectious microorganisms in hospitals and other health care environments.
 However, public health antimicrobial products tend to be low-volume products, and thus constitute less than 5% of the estimated total market for antimicrobial products.
 Types of Antimicrobial Products Products
 Antimicrobial products are divided into two categories based on the type of microbial pest against which the product works.
 Non-public health products are used to control growth of algae, odor-causing bacteria, bacteria which cause spoilage, deterioration or fouling of materials and microorganisms infectious only to animals.
 This general category includes products used in cooling towers, jet fuel, paints, and treatments for textile and paper products.
 Public health products are intended to control microorganisms infectious to humans in any inanimate environment.
 The more commonly used public health antimicrobial products include the following:
 Sterilizers (Sporicides):
 Used to destroy or eliminate all forms of microbial life including fungi, viruses, and all forms of bacteria and their spores.
 Spores are considered to be the most difficult form of microorganism to destroy.
 Therefore, EPA considers the term Sporicide to be synonymous with "Sterilizer." Sterilization is critical to infection control and is widely used in hospitals on medical and surgical, instruments and equipment.
 Types of sterilizers include steam under pressure (autoclaving), dry heat ovens, low temperature gas (ethylene oxide), and liquid chemical sterilants.
 Gaseous and dry heat sterilizers are used primarily for sterilization of medical instruments.
 Liquid sterilants are primarily used for delicate instruments which cannot withstand high temperature and gases.
 Disinfectants:
 Used on hard inanimate surfaces and objects to destroy or irreversibly inactivate infectious fungi and bacteria but not necessarily their spores.
 Disinfectant products are divided into two major types:
 hospital and general use.
 Hospital type disinfectants are the most critical to infection control and are used on medical and dental instruments, floors, walls, bed linens, toilet seats, and other surfaces.
 General disinfectants are the major source of products used in households, swimming pools, and water purifiers.
 Sanitizers:
 Used to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, microorganisms from the inanimate environment to levels considered safe as determined by public health codes or regulations.
 Sanitizers include food contact and non-food contact products.
 Sanitizing rinses for surfaces such as dishes and cooking utensils, as well as equipment and utensils found in dairies, food-processing plants, and eating and drinking establishments comprise the food contact Sanitizers.
 These products are important because they are used on sites where consumable food products are placed and stored.
 Non-food contact surface sanitizers include carpet sanitizers, air sanitizers, laundry additives, and in-tank toilet bowl sanitizers.
 Antiseptics and Germicides:
 Used to prevent inflection and decay by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms.
 Because these products are used in or on living humans or animals, they are considered drugs and are thus approved and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 EPA Regulation of Antimicrobial Products Products
 EPA registers and regulates antimicrobial pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
 To obtain registration, manufacturers of antimicrobial products must meet the basic standards, the foremost being:
 1) that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects to human health or the environment, and 2) that product labeling and composition comply with the requirements of FIFRA.
 Moreover, manufacturers are required to submit to EPA detailed and specific information concerning the chemical composition of their product; effectiveness data to document their claims against specific microorganisms and to support the directions for use provided in labeling; labeling that reflects the required elements for safe and effective use; and toxicology data to document any hazards associated with use of the product.
 Recently, increased concern has emerged regarding whether public health products used to kill microorganisms pathogenic to man on inanimate surfaces and objects in hospitals, schools, restaurants, and homes work as claimed on the label.
 The private and public sector communities, including competitor registrants, have made the Agency aware of sterilizers and hospital disinfectants which may be ineffective.
 EPA has responded to this situation by developing a comprehensive strategy to improve the regulation of antimicrobial pesticides pesticides
 Since public health products are crucial for infection control, and because of the increased controversy regarding product effectiveness, the Agency is conducting pre-registration confirmatory and post-registration enforcement testing of certain public health products.
 More specifically, EPA has entered into an Interagency Agreement with the FDA, and is jointly testing all sterilants except gases (registered and those seeking registration) and registered products which make unsubstantiated claims of controlling the bacterium which causes tuberculosis (including sterilants and hospital disinfectants).
 These two types of public health products are the most crucial to infection control and their failure could pose grave danger to the public and the medical community.
 Furthermore, EPA has greatly improved communications with the public, all levels of government, academia, user communities, industry, health professionals, trade organizations, and independent testing groups.
 Also, EPA has committed funds to ensure that the tests used to demonstrate the efficacy of antimicrobial products are reliable and reproducible; is in the process of developing a complaint system to handle concerns regarding ineffective products; amplified internal controls to ensure the integrity of data submitted by registrants; and is currently publishing a quarterly newsletter designed to educate the general public about the status and direction of the regulation of antimicrobial products.
 The Agency is actively working to ensure that all antimicrobial products sold and distributed in the marketplace are effective in protecting public health and the environment from potential health risks.

 Postby JohnofWem on Wed Jul 02, 2008 1:59 pm pm
 I've posted this before a couple of weeks ago but it is more relevant here here
 Our refrigerator is very old and not energy efficient so we decided it might be time to buy a new one.
 My wife started searching online and found that some of the suppliers stated that some makes had surfaces treated with an antibacterial agent.
 I suspect this might be triclosan to which I am extremely sensitive .
 Because of this we have to look very carefully at the ingredient lists in all sorts of products; there are very few brands of toothpaste which don't contain it for instance.
 Searching the Internet it appears that it is being incorporated into the surfaces of many household objects, especially those used in the kitchen and bathroom, see http://www.microban.com/europe/?lang=en.
 It is even in some brands of waste basket bags and apparently some plastic bags used for selling fish and meat have it incorporated as well as the surfaces they have been prepared on or displayed.
 What really gets me is the pictures of children in this promo material.
 They claim it is safe and yet googling tells you something very different.
 For instance Wikipedia Triclosan Triclosan
 Reports have suggested that triclosan can combine with chlorine in tap water to form chloroform gas,[16] which the United States Environmental Protection Agency classifies as a probable human carcinogen.
 As a result, triclosan was the target of a UK cancer alert, even though the study showed that the amount of chloroform generated was less than amounts often present in chlorinated drinking waters.
 Triclosan reacts with the free chlorine in tap water to also produce lesser amounts of other compounds, like 2,4-dichlorophenol.[16] Most of these intermediates convert into dioxins upon exposure to UV radiation (from the sun or other sources).
 Although small amounts of dioxins are produced, there is a great deal of concern over this effect because dioxins are extremely toxic and are very potent endocrine disruptors.
 They are also chemically very stable, so that they are eliminated from the body very slowly (they can bioaccumulate to dangerous levels), and they persist in the environment for a very long time.
 Triclosan is chemically somewhat similar to the dioxin class of compounds.
 Its production leads to small amounts of residual polychlorinated dioxins, and polychlorinated furans which are contained in small amounts, in the products that are using it.
 A 2006 study concluded that low doses of triclosan act as an endocrine disruptor in the North American bullfrog.[17] The hypothesis proposed is that triclosan blocks the metabolism of thyroid hormone, because it chemically mimics thyroid hormone, and binds to the hormone receptor sites, blocking them, so that normal hormones cannot be utilized.
 Triclosan has also been found in both the bile of fish living downstream from waste water processing plants and in human breast milk.[18] The negative effects of Triclosan on the environment and its questionable benefits in toothpastes[19] has led to the Swedish Naturskyddsföreningen to recommend not using triclosan in toothpaste.[20] toothpaste.[20]
 How do people get away with selling such dangerous substances, especially those known to persist in the environment for decades?
 Trouble is not all retailers or manufacturers tell you it is present in the plastic surfaces of their products so we will need to be very careful to find one which specifically says it doesn't have antibacterial treatment.
 PS.
 We don't eat fish very often but I am quite partial to fresh mackerel.
 Yesterday my wife did her six weekly visit to the supermarket and came back with some which we had for our evening meal - everything else was home grown; potatoes, broad beans and strawberries.
 About half an hour later I suddenly had a very bad asthma attack (peak flow down from 680 to 150) and needed over 20 puffs of salbutamol to reverse it and 5 more doses of 8 puffs during the next 12 hours or so.
 I also had very bad arthralgia which fortunately I have now recovered from more quickly than usual.
 My first thoughts were that the fish was contaminated by chemicals in the water where it was caught but reading about triclosan being in the plastic bags used for selling wet fish makes me wonder if this could be the cause?
 Even out here in the middle of nowhere I am not always safe.
 How you city folk with MCS cope must be a continous nightmare.
 PPS.
 We have now bought a new refrigerator or a refrigerated larder to be precise, it doesn't have an ice box which we don't need and costs less to run.
 We bought it from Lec after searching their website and asking them to confirm there were no antimicrobials in its surfaces.
 They confirmed there weren't and went on to point out that the best way to keep the inside clean and fresh was to use a dilute solution of sodium bicarbonate and keep a small open container of the powder inside it as a deodouriser.
 My wife already uses this or white vinegar for cleaning.
 They work just as well as all the commercial cleaners like Flash, Dettol and Cilit Bang, cost less and don't do me or anyone else a mischief !! !!

 Antimicrobial Pesticides and Antibacterial Personal Products Products
 Postby Gordon on Wed Jul 02, 2008 3:24 pm pm
 Hi JohnofWem JohnofWem
 Thank you for an excellent development of the topic.
 As you say "How do people get away with selling such dangerous substances, especially those known to persist in the environment for decades?".
 Given that we pay our politicians handsomely to protect us from this kind of thing - how indeed?
 ﻿WHAT THIS GENERAL CLAIM MEANS:
 Germicidal means a product or substance(s)that kills germs.
 It is similar to the term antibacterial or antimicrobial.
 Antibacterial describes a substance(s) or product that kills or inhibits the growth of bacteria, generally in/on foods, inanimate surfaces, or hands.
 EPA regulates the use of this claim on household cleaning products, kitchen products such as sponges and cutting boards, children's products and recreational products such as tents.
 Germicidal/antibacterial claims mean different things on different products (discussion of this term on personal care products).
 Technically, germicidals are considered by EPA and FDA to be a subset of antimicrobials.
 HOUSEHOLD CLEANERS CLEANERS
 EPA regulates all household cleaning products and laundry detergents that claim to have germicidal or antimicrobial properties except dishwashing soap is an exception to this general rule (see below).
 EPA classifies the active ingredient—that is, the ingredient that works to kill or reduce the microorganisms—as a pesticide and requires it to undergo safety and effectiveness testing prior to marketing, and the active ingredient to be identified on the label.
 EPA considers additional claims on germicidal labeled products such as "non-toxic" or "all natural" to be false or misleading.
 In addition, EPA does not routinely review efficacy (effectiveness) data for products that make odor-resistant claims, although the manufacturer is supposed to generate this information and keep it on file.
 EPA also regulates household cleaners that make germicidal claims and also claim to be disinfectants or sanitizers.
 The label of household disinfectants must indicate whether the product is effective only against one specific group of microorganisms or against a broad spectrum of microorganisms (in which case it may be called a “general” disinfectant).
 Dishwashing soaps that claim to be "germicidal" would normally be considered to be household cleaners and therefore be regulated by EPA.
 However, to date, EPA has not registered nor reviewed any germicidal dishwashing soaps even though there are many "germicidal" dish soaps on the market.
 Based on our research, it appears that these germicidal dishwashing soaps are actually classified and labeled by the manufacturer as hand soaps, which means they are personal hygiene products and fall under the authority of the FDA.
 Since FDA has no current testing requirement in place for germicidal active ingredients, these "germicidal" labeled dishwashing products are not tested for safety or effectiveness.
 Detergents, including laundry detergents, that make germicidal claims are regulated by EPA and must display the EPA registration number.
 KITCHEN, CHILDREN'S, AND RECREATIONAL PRODUCTS PRODUCTS
 Germicidal/antimicrobial claims are also increasingly appearing on products such as sponges, cutting boards, and toys.
 EPA theoretically regulates these kinds of products where the product itself is treated with substances designed to kill bacteria or other microbes in the product and where the products that claim to protect more than the product itself.
 However, EPA has not approved any treated products to make any public health claims, to date, since according to EPA, there is no evidence that these products prevent the spread of germs and bacteria in people.
 Nevertheless, these types of unauthorized claims are being made.
 Besides being unlawful, EPA is concerned that they may be potentially harmful to the public, since if people believe that a product has a self-sanitizing quality, they may not wash or follow proper hygienic practices to prevent the transmission of harmful germs.
 If you see a sponge, toy, or other kitchen or children's products that makes any of the following “germicidal” claims, these claims are illegal.
 You can report this to the Federal Trade Commission (see below for how):
 -- Antibacterial Antibacterial
 -- Bactericidal Bactericidal
 -- Germicidal Germicidal
 -- Kills pathogenic bacteria.
 -- Effective against E.
 coli and Staphylococcus.
 -- Reduces the risk of food-borne illness from bacteria.
 -- Provides a germ-resistant surface.
 -- Provides a bacteria-resistant surface.
 -- Surface kills common gram positive and negative bacteria.
 -- Surface controls both gram positive and negative bacteria.
 -- Surface minimizes the growth of both gram positive and negative bacteria.
 -- Reduces risk of cross-contamination from bacteria.
 -- Controls allergy causing microorganisms.
 -- Improves indoor air quality through the reduction of microorganisms.
 EPA does allow some treated products to be labeled as “resists the growth of mold/mildew,” or “kills germs that cause odor.” However, EPA is concerned that some products such as sponges, that are used in the kitchen, bathroom, or other areas where disease-causing organisms may be present can give the false impression that the sponge or other article provides protection against food-borne and disease-causing bacteria.
 According to EPA, this potential for a false impression should be addressed through additional labeling such as “This product does not protect users or others against bacteria, viruses, germs or other disease organisms.
 Always clean this product thoroughly after each use.” use.”
 Some critics think that germicidal / antimicrobial claims even when truthful are playing on consumers' fears.
 They advise consumers not to buy these products except in unusual circumstances.
 Stuart Levy, M.D., president of the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics and a researcher in the field, believes that germicidal products should only be used by hospitals, sick people coming home from the hospital, and those with compromised immune systems.
 “Good soap and water is sufficient in most cases,” Levy says.
 Overuse of antibacterial substances can lead to bacteria becoming resistant to them, which is a problem for public health.
 The long-term safety of triclosan, a widely used antibacterial in personal care products, and its effectiveness in products other than toothpaste is particularly controversial.
 EPA has registered triclosan as a pesticide, but Lester Crawford, Deputy Commissioner of the FDA, stated in October 2002, “In 1974, our agency published the recommendations of its advisory panel on over-the-counter antimicrobial drug products.
 Among other findings the panel … identified triclosan as one of the ingredients of antimicrobial products that lacked sufficient evidence of safety and effectiveness.
 … The FDA still is looking for data on the long-term health effects of triclosan, and at present there is no joint effort to trace the effect, if any, of antiseptic products on antimicrobial resistance.
 … consumers and health care professionals are not as fully protected as they deserve, expect, and have the right to be.” be.”
 In the meantime, FDA has taken no action against use of Triclosan.
 Triclosan may also impact the environment.
 Triclosan has been found in the majority of surface waters tested for pollutants from common household chemical products.
 There is some evidence that triclosan adversely affects freshwater algae.
 Other studies indicate that it can be converted by sunlight into a member of the dioxin family.
 	 	
 WHO VERIFIES THIS GENERAL CLAIM?
 EPA requires manufacturers of household cleaners that make an antimicrobial, antibacterial, or similar type of “kills germs” claim to meet standards set by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), which requires that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects to human health or the environment.
 Thus the product must be safe.
 EPA requires manufacturers to submit detailed and specific information concerning the chemical composition of their product, toxicology data documenting any hazards associated with use of the product, effectiveness data provided by the registrant (manufacturer of the active ingredient) to document their claims against specific microorganisms, and labeling that reflects most of the required elements of safe and effective use.
 	 	
 CONSUMERS UNION EVALUATION:
 How meaningful is the label?
 A germicidal claim on Household Cleaners is somewhat meaningful.
 EPA requires companies to submit information on household cleaners (including disinfectants and sanitizers, excluding dishwashing detergent) that make a germicidal claim, and EPA reviews the information, to ensure that the active ingredient (the one that works against bacteria) meets required safety and effectiveness tests, and that the product is labeled properly.
 However, there have been reports of products not working as claimed, so the system is not foolproof.
 In response, EPA has tested products used in hospitals, but has not tested products used in the home.
 Foods, drugs, and cosmetics are required to list their ingredients (with a few exceptions, such as fragrances in cosmetics), but household cleaning products are not required to disclose their ingredients (except for disinfectants or other ingredients considered to be antimicrobial pesticides).
 A germicidal claim on Kitchen, Children and Recreational Products is not meaningful.
 In fact, such claims are not permitted.
 Contact the EPA and FTC if you encounter an “germicidal” claim on sponges, toilet seats, or toys.
 Does an organization verify that the label standards are met?
 Yes.
 The EPA does require testing of active ingredients prior to marketing before cleaning products can make an “germicidal” claim to ensure that are safe and efficacious.
 The EPA and the FTC have taken action against some products, in some cases involving fines of $100,000.
 However, their ability to do so is significantly limited by legal and resource constraints, and numerous products (particularly treated articles) are on the market that that
 Is the meaning of the label consistent?
 No, since different germicidal agents in household cleaners could be used that have varying levels of safety and effectiveness against variable numbers or types of microbes.
 While antibacterial claims for Kitchen, Children and Recreational Products exist, none have been approved at this time time
 Are the label standards publicly available?
 Yes, all laws and government standards and policies are publicly available.
 Is information about the standard organization publicly available?
 Yes, information about government agencies is available (by phone, through publications, and through their websites).
 Is the organization behind the label free from conflict of public interest?
 Yes, in that it is a government agency.
 Was the label developed with broad public and industry input?
 Yes.
 Pesticides are a cause of pollution, affecting land and water in particular.
 The problem is huge and growing.
 Picture:
 Rivers and other water sources may be affected by pesticides pesticides
 In the US pesticides pollution has been found in nearly every lake, river and stream, according to a US Geological Survey in the 1990s.
 Other nations are affected badly, too.
 Pesticides cause pollution by running off agricultural fields and from horticultural land and domestic gardens, too.
 Rain water washes the chemicals into nearby water sources.
 Here are some of the bad effects of pesticides.
 Pesticides and pollution of the soil soil
 First, pesticides affect soil quality.
 Pesticides decrease biodiversity in the soil because they do not just kill the intended pest; they often kill many of the other small organisms present.
 When life in the soil is killed off, the soil quality deteriorates and this has a knock-on effect upon the retention of water.
 This is a problem for farmers particularly in times of drought.
 At such times, organic farms have been found to have yields 20-40% higher than conventional farms.
 Soil fertility is affected in other ways, too.
 When pesticides kill off most of the active soil organisms, the complex interactions which result in good fertility break down.
 Plants depend on millions of bacteria and fungi to bring nutrients to their rootlets.
 When these cycles are disrupted plants become more dependent upon exact doses of chemical fertilisers at regular intervals.
 Even so, the fantastically rich interactions in healthy soil cannot be fully replicated by the farmer with chemicals.
 See here for more on the benefits of growing food organically organically
 So the soil - and our nutrition - is compromised.
 We get large but watery vegetables and fruits, which often lack taste and nutrients and may even contain pesticide residues.
 One of the best books ever written on pesticides and the damage they cause is Silent Spring by Rachel Carson.
 It is about the systematic poisoning of the American landscape by pesticides in the 1940s and 1950s.
 Modern pesticide pollution is perhaps not quite so devastating as that revealed in this influential book - but it is worth reading for the cautionary tale - and because it explains how business interests were put ahead of the common good.
 Pesticides have other bad effects on the eco-system.
 The misuse of pesticides can cause valuable pollinators such as bees and hover-flies to be killed and this in turn can badly affect food crops.
 Bees have been suffering a serious decline in recent years for reasons which are not yet clear (but pesticides are thought to be implicated).
 We interfere with our allies in the natural world at our peril.
 Without bees, many food crops would simply fail to grow; they pollinate the plants so that they can produce fruits and grains.
 See missing bees for more about the crisis affecting bees worldwide.
 There are fears (and some evidence) that through natural selection, some pests may eventually become quite resistant to pesticides.
 Farmers may then try increasing amounts used of pesticides, making the problem worse.
 Many pesticides contain chemicals which are persistent soil contaminants.
 Their effects may last for years.
 Amphibians such as frogs are particularly vulnerable to concentrations of pesticides in their habitat.
 Atrazine, one of the world's most popular weedkillers, has been found to feminize frogs, leading to sterility in males.
 It is still in use in the US, with about 80 million pounds being applied annually, but has been banned in the EU countries since 2004.
 It may also affect male fertility in humans and is a known endocrine disruptor.
 This is a fairly typical example of pesticides and pollution which results, affecting the lives of people and wildlife alike.
 Because of the profits to be made most companies are slow to accept responsibility and the problem is hidden by the use of numerous trade names for the one chemical.
 See this Care2 article for more on this weedkiller.
 Pesticides are almost certainly causing a steep decline in many insect species, including bees.
 Pesticides and human health health
 Pesticides can also endanger workers during production, transportation, or during and after use.
 Bystanders may also be affected at times, for example walkers using public rights of way on adjacent land or families whose homes are close by crop spraying activities.
 One of the main hazards of pesticide use is to farm workers and gardeners.
 A recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, discovered a 70% increase in the risk of developing Parkinson�s disease for people exposed to even low levels of pesticides.
 The effects of pesticides upon children children
 Pesticides and pollution pollution
 Children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of pesticides.
 Studies have found higher rates of brain cancer, leukaemia and birth defects in children who suffered early exposure to pesticides.
 (National Resources Defence Council study) study)
 see below for an example of OPs affecting school children.
 Diet as a source of exposure exposure
 Pesticides and pollution pollution
 The main source of exposure to pesticides for most people is through diet.
 A study in 2006 measured organophosphorus levels in 23 school children before and after changing their diet to organic food.
 The levels of organophosphorus exposure dropped immediately and dramatically when the children began the organic diet.
 Residues, set by governments, are limited to tolerance levels that are considered safe, based on average daily consumption of these foods by adults and children.
 But, as we all know, some people do not behave as average! average!
 For example, when I used to work in a college, there were students who regularly consumed 6 or 7 packs of crisps in a day.
 And toddlers are notorious for becoming obsessed with one or two foods only.
 At best, tolerance levels are only an educated guess as to what residue levels we might be able to get away with! As the evidence about the toxicity of some pesticides becomes clearer, tolerance levels are being reduced by many governments.
 Most modern pesticides are carefully regulated by law in most countries.
 In the US the EPA conducts studies and licenses pesticides for use.
 However, they cannot actually control what happens when a particular farmer opens a particular product.
 We depend upon the farmer to read the label and follow the guidelines to the letter.
 Accidents will and do happen.
 Some pesticides are so toxic that their use is restricted to licensed, trained applicators.
 In the US it is a violation to apply any pesticide in any way that is not in accordance with the label for that pesticide.
 Further, it is a crime to do so intentionally.
 In most counties pesticides are classified according to their toxicity.
 Most acute pesticide poisonings result from disregarding the label directions.
 If you must use toxic pesticides at all (and there are usually safer alternatives) - then the most important advice is:
 Read the label! - and then follow the instructions to the letter.
 Apart from political action, anyone who is concerned about the toxic effects of pesticides should try to eat organic food whenever possible.
 Organic foods are grown without toxic pesticides for the most part.
 If you are growing food or flowers and other plants at home, consider doing everything by organic methods.
 There are many strategies available to organic gardeners to avoid attacks by pests.
 The toxic effects of pesticides on our foods and our land and the effects on our health and the health of our children make it an issue which is sure to become more and more crucial.
 According to a recent survey, 75 percent of U.S.
 households used at least one pesticide product indoors during the past year.
 Products used most often are insecticides and disinfectants.
 Another study suggests that 80 percent of most people's exposure to pesticides occurs indoors and that measurable levels of up to a dozen pesticides have been found in the air inside homes.
 The amount of pesticides found in homes appears to be greater than can be explained by recent pesticide use in those households; other possible sources include contaminated soil or dust that floats or is tracked in from outside, stored pesticide containers, and household surfaces that collect and then release the pesticides.
 Pesticides used in and around the home include products to control insects (insecticides), termites (termiticides), rodents (rodenticides), fungi (fungicides), and microbes (disinfectants).
 They are sold as sprays, liquids, sticks, powders, crystals, balls, and foggers.
 In 1990, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported that some 79,000 children were involved in common household pesticide poisonings or exposures.
 In households with children under five years old, almost one-half stored at least one pesticide product within reach of children.
 EPA registers pesticides for use and requires manufacturers to put information on the label about when and how to use the pesticide.
 It is important to remember that the "-cide" in pesticides means "to kill".
 These products can be dangerous if not used properly.
 In addition to the active ingredient, pesticides are also made up of ingredients that are used to carry the active agent.
 These carrier agents are called "inerts" in pesticides because they are not toxic to the targeted pest; nevertheless, some inerts are capable of causing health problems.

 Sources of Pesticides Pesticides
 Products used to kill household pests (insecticides, termiticides, and disinfectants).
 Also, products used on lawns and gardens that drift or are tracked inside the house.
 Pesticides are chemicals that are used to kill or control pests which include bacteria, fungi, and other organisms, in addition to insects and rodents.
 Pesticides are inherently toxic.
 Top of page page
 Health Effects Effects
 Irritation to eye, nose, and throat; damage to central nervous system and kidney; increased risk of cancer.
 Symptoms may include headache, dizziness, muscular weakness, and nausea.
 Chronic exposure to some pesticides can result in damage to the liver, kidneys, endocrine and nervous systems.
 Both the active and inert ingredients in pesticides can be organic compounds; therefore, both could add to the levels of airborne organics inside homes.
 Both types of ingredients can cause the type of effects discussed in Household Chemicals/Products.
 However, as with other household products, there is insufficient understanding at present about what pesticide concentrations are necessary to produce these effects.
 Exposure to high levels of cyclodiene pesticides, commonly associated with misapplication, has produced various symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, muscle twitching, weakness, tingling sensations, and nausea.
 In addition, EPA is concerned that cyclodienes might cause long-term damage to the liver and the central nervous system, as well as an increased risk of cancer.
 There is no further sale or commercial use permitted for the following cyclodiene or related pesticides:
 chlordane, aldrin, dieldrin, and heptachlor.
 The only exception is the use of heptachlor by utility companies to control fire ants in underground cable boxes.

 Steps to Reduce Exposure Exposure
 Use strictly according to manufacturer's directions.
 Mix or dilute outdoors.
 Apply only in recommended quantities.
 Increase ventilation when using indoors.
 Take plants or pets outdoors when applying pesticides/flea and tick treatments.
 Use non-chemical methods of pest control where possible.
 If you use a pest control company, select it carefully.
 Do not store unneeded pesticides inside home; dispose of unwanted containers safely.
 Store clothes with moth repellents in separately ventilated areas, if possible.
 Keep indoor spaces clean, dry, and well ventilated to avoid pest and odor problems.
 Read the label and follow the directions.
 It is illegal to use any pesticide in any manner inconsistent with the directions on its label.
 Unless you have had special training and are certified, never use a pesticide that is restricted to use by state-certified pest control operators.
 Such pesticides are simply too dangerous for application by a non-certified person.
 Use only the pesticides approved for use by the general public and then only in recommended amounts; increasing the amount does not offer more protection against pests and can be harmful to you and your plants and pets.
 Ventilate the area well after pesticide use.
 Mix or dilute pesticides outdoors or in a well-ventilated area and only in the amounts that will be immediately needed.
 If possible, take plants and pets outside when applying pesticides/flea and tick treatments.
 Use non-chemical methods of pest control when possible.
 Since pesticides can be found far from the site of their original application, it is prudent to reduce the use of chemical pesticides outdoors as well as indoors.
 Depending on the site and pest to be controlled, one or more of the following steps can be effective:
 use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection of disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants and pets.
 Termite damage can be reduced or prevented by making certain that wooden building materials do not come into direct contact with the soil and by storing firewood away from the home.
 By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating lawns, the need for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be dramatically reduced.
 If you decide to use a pest control company, choose one carefully.
 Ask for an inspection of your home and get a written control program for evaluation before you sign a contract.
 The control program should list specific names of pests to be controlled and chemicals to be used; it should also reflect any of your safety concerns.
 Insist on a proven record of competence and customer satisfaction.
 Dispose of unwanted pesticides safely.
 If you have unused or partially used pesticide containers you want to get rid of, dispose of them according to the directions on the label or on special household hazardous waste collection days.
 If there are no such collection days in your community, work with others to organize them.
 Keep exposure to moth repellents to a minimum.
 One pesticide often found in the home is paradichlorobenzene, a commonly used active ingredient in moth repellents.
 This chemical is known to cause cancer in animals, but substantial scientific uncertainty exists over the effects, if any, of long-term human exposure to paradichlorobenzene.
 EPA requires that products containing paradichlorobenzene bear warnings such as "avoid breathing vapors" to warn users of potential short-term toxic effects.
 Where possible, paradichlorobenzene, and items to be protected against moths, should be placed in trunks or other containers that can be stored in areas that are separately ventilated from the home, such as attics and detached garages.
 Paradichlorobenzene is also the key active ingredient in many air fresheners (in fact, some labels for moth repellents recommend that these same products be used as air fresheners or deodorants).
 Proper ventilation and basic household cleanliness will go a long way toward preventing unpleasant odors.
 Integrated Pest Management Management
 If chemicals must be used, use only the recommended amounts, mix or dilute pesticides outdoors or in an isolated well ventilated area, apply to unoccupied areas, and dispose of unwanted pesticides safely to minimize exposure.

 Pesticides are substances or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling or mitigating any pest. A pesticide may be a chemical substance, biological agent (such as a virus or bacterium), antimicrobial, disinfectant or device used against any pest.
 Pests include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, molluscs, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, spread disease or are a vector for disease or cause a nuisance.
 Although there are benefits to the use of pesticides, some also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other animals.
 According to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, 9 of the 12 most dangerous and persistent organic chemicals are pesticides.[2][3] pesticides.[2][3]

  DefinitionFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has defined the term of pesticide as:
 any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying or controlling any pest, including vectors of human or animal disease, unwanted species of plants or animals causing harm during or otherwise interfering with the production, processing, storage, transport or marketing of food, agricultural commodities, wood and wood products or animal feedstuffs, or substances which may be administered to animals for the control of insects, arachnids or other pests in or on their bodies.
 The term includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit.
 Also used as substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.[4] transport.[4]

 Subclasses of pesticides include:
 herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, pediculicides, and biocides.[3][5] biocides.[3][5]
 Pesticides can be classified by target organism, chemical structure, and physical state.[6] Pesticides can also be classed as inorganic, synthetic, or biologicals (biopesticides),[6] although the distinction can sometimes blur.
 Biopesticides include microbial pesticides and biochemical pesticides.[7] Plant-derived pesticides, or "botanicals", have been developing quickly.
 These include the pyrethroids, rotenoids, nicotinoids, and a fourth group that includes strychnine and scilliroside.[8]:15 scilliroside.[8]:15
 Many pesticides can be grouped into chemical families.
 Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates.
 Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g.
 DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, and other related compounds.
 They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously.
 Their toxicities vary greatly, but they have been phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate.[8]:239-240 Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines.
 Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis.
 Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates, and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates.[8]:136-137 Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates.
 Prominent families of herbicides include pheoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g.
 2,4-D), triazines (e.g.
 atrazine), ureas (e.g.
 diuron), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g.
 alachlor).
 Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broadleaved weeds rather than grasses.
 The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plants nutrient transport system.[8]:300 Triazines interfere with photsynthesis.[8]:335 Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.
 Pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method.
 Most pesticides work by poisoning pests.[9] A systemic pesticide moves inside a plant following absorption by the plant.
 With insecticides and most fungicides, this movement is usually upward (through the xylem) and outward.
 Increased efficiency may be a result.
 Systemic insecticides, which poison pollen and nectar in the flowers, may kill bees and other needed pollinators.
 In 2009, the development of a new class of fungicides called paldoxins was announced.
 These work by taking advantage of natural defense chemicals released by plants called phytoalexins, which fungi then detoxify using enzymes.
 The paldoxins inhibit the fungi's detoxification enzymes.
 They are believed to be safer and greener.[10] greener.[10]
  UsesPesticides are used to control organisms considered harmful.[11] For example, they are used to kill mosquitoes that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like west nile virus, yellow fever, and malaria.
 They can also kill bees, wasps or ants that can cause allergic reactions.
 Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by parasites such as fleas.[11] Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by moldy food or diseased produce.
 Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees and brush.
 They can also kill invasive weeds that may cause environmental damage.
 Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant.[12] Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mould can damage structures such as houses.[11] Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage rodents and insects that infest food such as grain.
 Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk.
 Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Canada.
 Pesticides can save farmers' money by preventing crop losses to insects and other pests; in the U.S., farmers get an estimated fourfold return on money they spend on pesticides.[13] One study found that not using pesticides reduced crop yields by about 10%.[14] Another study, conducted in 1999, found that a ban on pesticides in the United States may result in a rise of food prices, loss of jobs, and an increase in world hunger.[15] hunger.[15]
 DDT, sprayed on the walls of houses, is an organochloride that has been used to fight malaria since the 1950s.
 Recent policy statements by the World Health Organization have given stronger support to this approach.[16] Dr.
 Arata Kochi, WHO's malaria chief, said, "One of the best tools we have against malaria is indoor residual house spraying.
 Of the dozen insecticides WHO has approved as safe for house spraying, the most effective is DDT."[16] However, since then, an October 2007 study has linked breast cancer from exposure to DDT prior to puberty.[17] Poisoning may also occur due to use of DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons by entering the human food chain when animal tissues are affected.
 Symptoms include nervous excitement, tremors, convulsions or death.
   AmountsIn 2006 and 2008,the world used approximately 5.2 billion pounds of pesticides with herbicides constituting the majority of the world pesticide use at 40% followed by insecticides and fungicides with totals of 17% and 10% respectively.[21] The U.S.
 in 2006 and 2007, used approximately 1.1 billion pounds of pesticides accounting for 22% of the world total.[21] For conventional pesticides which are used in the agricultural sector as well in industry, commercial, governmental and the home & garden sectors, the U.S.
 used at total of 857 million pounds, with the agricultural sector accounting for 80% of the conventional pesticide use total.[21] Pesticides are also found in majority of U.S.
 households with 78 million out of the 105.5 million households indicating that they use some form of pesticide.[21] Currently,there are more than 1,055 active ingredients registered as pesticides,[22] which are put together to produce over 16,000 pesticide products that are being marketed in the United States [23] [23]
  CostsOn the cost side of pesticide use there can be a cost to the environment and human health, as well as the cost of the development and research of new pesticides.
  Health effects effects
 A sign warning about potential pesticide exposure.Main articles:
 Health effects of pesticides and Pesticide poisoning poisoning
 Pesticides may cause acute and delayed health effects in those who are exposed.[24] Pesticide exposure can cause a variety of adverse health effects.
 These effects can range from simple irritation of the skin and eyes to more severe effects such as affecting the nervous system, mimicking hormones causing reproductive problems, and also causing cancer.[25] A 2007 systematic review found that "most studies on non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia showed positive associations with pesticide exposure" and thus concluded that cosmetic use of pesticides should be decreased.[26] Strong evidence also exists for other negative outcomes from pesticide exposure including neurological, birth defects, fetal death,[27] and neurodevelopmental disorder.[28] disorder.[28]
 The American Medical Association recommends limiting exposure to pesticides and using safer alternatives:[6] "Particular uncertainty exists regarding the long-term effects of low-dose pesticide exposures.
 Current surveillance systems are inadequate to characterize potential exposure problems related either to pesticide usage or pesticide-related illnesses�Considering these data gaps, it is prudent�to limit pesticide exposures�and to use the least toxic chemical pesticide or non-chemical alternative." alternative."
 The World Health Organization and the UN Environment Programme estimate that each year, 3 million workers in agriculture in the developing world experience severe poisoning from pesticides, about 18,000 of whom die.[18] According to one study, as many as 25 million workers in developing countries may suffer mild pesticide poisoning yearly.[29] yearly.[29]
 One study found pesticide self-poisoning the method of choice in one third of suicides worldwide, and recommended, among other things, more restrictions on the types of pesticides that are most harmful to humans.[30] humans.[30]
  Environmental effectMain article:
 Environmental effects of pesticides pesticides
 Pesticide use raises a number of environmental concerns.
 Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including non-target species, air, water and soil.[18] Pesticide drift occurs when pesticides suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them.
 Pesticides are one of the causes of water pollution, and some pesticides are persistent organic pollutants and contribute to soil contamination.
 In addition, pesticide use reduces biodiversity, reduces nitrogen fixation,[31] contributes to pollinator decline,[32][33][34][35] destroys habitat (especially for birds),[36] and threatens endangered species.[18] species.[18]
 Pests can develop a resistance to the pesticide (pesticide resistance), necessitating a new pesticide.
 Alternatively a greater dose of the pesticide can be used to counteract the resistance, although this will cause a worsening of the ambient pollution problem.
  EconomicsHarm Annual US Cost Cost
 Public Health $1.1 billion billion
 Pesticide Resistance in Pest $1.5 billion billion
 Crop Losses Caused by Pesticides $1.4 billion billion
 Bird Losses due to Pesticides $2.2 billion billion

 Human health and environmental cost from pesticides in the United States is a total of $9.6 billion:[37] billion:[37]
 Additional cost includes the registration process and the cost of purchase pesticides.
 The registration process can take several years to complete the 70 different types of field test and can cost between $50�70 million for a single pesticide.[37] Annually the United States spends $10 billion on pesticides.[37] pesticides.[37]

  MonetaryFor every dollar ($1) that is spent on pesticides for crops yields four dollars ($4) in crops saved.[39] This means based on the amount of money spent per year on pesticides, $10 billion, that there is an additional $40 billion savings in crop that would be lost due to damage by insects and weeds.
 Generally speaking, farmers benefit from having an increase crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year.
 Consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year round.[38] The general public also benefits from the use of pesticides for the control of insect-borne diseases and illnesses, such as malaria.[38] The use of pesticides creates a large job market, which provides jobs for all of the people who work within the industry.
  AlternativesAlternatives to pesticides are available and include methods of cultivation, use of biological pest controls (such as pheromones and microbial pesticides), genetic engineering, and methods of interfering with insect breeding.[18] Application of composted yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pests.[40] These methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides.
 In addition, EPA is registering reduced-risk conventional pesticides in increasing numbers.
 Cultivation practices include polyculture (growing multiple types of plants), crop rotation, planting crops in areas where the pests that damage them do not live, timing planting according to when pests will be least problematic, and use of trap crops that attract pests away from the real crop.[18] In the U.S., farmers have had success controlling insects by spraying with hot water at a cost that is about the same as pesticide spraying.[18] spraying.[18]
 Release of other organisms that fight the pest is another example of an alternative to pesticide use.
 These organisms can include natural predators or parasites of the pests.[18] Biological pesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses cause disease in the pest species can also be used.[18] used.[18]
 Interfering with insects' reproduction can be accomplished by sterilizing males of the target species and releasing them, so that they mate with females but do not produce offspring.[18] This technique was first used on the screwworm fly in 1958 and has since been used with the medfly, the tsetse fly,[41] and the gypsy moth.[42] However, this can be a costly, time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.[18] insects.[18]
 Another alternative to pesticides is the thermal treatment of soil through steam.
 Soil steaming kills pest and increases soil health. needed]
 In India, traditional pest control methods include using Panchakavya, the "mixture of five products." The method has recently experienced a resurgence in popularity due in part to use by the organic farming community. needed]
  Push pull strategyThe term "push-pull" was established in 1987 as an approach for integrated pest management (IPM).
 This strategy uses a mixture of behavior-modifying stimuli to manipulate the distribution and abundance of insects.
 "Push" means the insects are repelled or deterred away from whatever resource that is being protected.
 "Pull" means that certain stimuli (semiochemical stimuli, pheromones, food additives, visual stimuli, genetically altered plants, etc.) are used to attract pests to trap crops where they will be killed [43] There are numerous different components involved in order to implement a Push-Pull Strategy in IPM.
 Many case studies testing the effectiveness of the push-pull approach have been done across the world.
 The most successful push-pull strategy was developed in Africa for subsistence farming.
 Another successful case study was performed on the control of Helicoverpa in cotton crops in Australia.
 In Europe, the Middle East, and the United States, push-pull strategies were successfully used in the controlling of Sitona lineatus in bean fields.
[43] Plus many more cases where this strategy was more beneficial than simply using pesticides on their crops.
 Some advantages of using the push-pull method are less use of chemical or biological materials and better protection against insect habituation to this control method.
 Some disadvantages of the push-pull strategy is that if there is a lack of appropriate knowledge of behavioral and chemical ecology of the host-pest interactions then this method becomes unreliable.
 Furthermore, because the push-pull method is not a very popular method of IPM operational and registration costs are higher.[44] higher.[44]
 (See:
 Push�pull technology.) technology.)
  EffectivenessSome evidence shows that alternatives to pesticides can be equally effective as the use of chemicals.
 For example, Sweden has halved its use of pesticides with hardly any reduction in crops.
[18] In Indonesia, farmers have reduced pesticide use on rice fields by 65% and experienced a 15% crop increase.
 However, pesticide resistance is increasing.
 In the 1940s, U.S.
 farmers lost only 7% of their crops to pests.
 Since the 1980s, loss has increased to 13%, even though more pesticides are being used.
 Between 500 and 1,000 insect and weed species have developed pesticide resistance since 1945.[45] 1945.[45]
 InternationalIn Europe, recent EU legislation has been approved banning the use of highly toxic pesticides including those that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, those that are endocrine-disrupting, and those that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB).
 Measures were approved to improve the general safety of pesticides across all EU member states.
 Though pesticide regulations differ from country to country, pesticides and products on which they were used are traded across international borders.
 To deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries, delegates to a conference of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization adopted an International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for different countries.
[47] The Code was updated in 1998 and 2002.
[48] The FAO claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use.[4] use.[4]
 Three other efforts to improve regulation of international pesticide trade are the United Nations London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade and the United Nations Codex Alimentarius Commission.
 The former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides, while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries.
[49] Both initiatives operate on a voluntary basis.[49] basis.[49]
 Pesticide safety education and pesticide applicator regulation are designed to protect the public from pesticide misuse, but do not eliminate all misuse.
 Reducing the use of pesticides and choosing less toxic pesticides may reduce risks placed on society and the environment from pesticide use.
[12] Integrated pest management, the use of multiple approaches to control pests, is becoming widespread and has been used with success in countries such as Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, the U.S., Australia, and Mexico.
[18] IPM attempts to recognize the more widespread impacts of an action on an ecosystem, so that natural balances are not upset.[50] New pesticides are being developed, including biological and botanical derivatives and alternatives that are thought to reduce health and environmental risks.
 In addition, applicators are being encouraged to consider alternative controls and adopt methods that reduce the use of chemical pesticides.
 Pesticides can be created that are targeted to a specific pest's life cycle, which can be environmentally more friendly.
[51] For example, potato cyst nematodes emerge from their protective cysts in response to a chemical excreted by potatoes; they feed on the potatoes and damage the crop.
[51] A similar chemical can be applied to fields early, before the potatoes are planted, causing the nematodes to emerge early and starve in the absence of potatoes.[51] potatoes.[51]
  United StatesMain article:
 Pesticide regulation in the United States States
 Preparation for an application of hazardous pesticide in USA.In most countries, pesticides must be approved for sale and use by a government agency.
[47] In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for regulating pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA).
[52] Complex and costly studies must be conducted to indicate whether the material is safe to use and effective against the intended pest. The EPA regulates pesticides to ensure that these products do not pose adverse effects to humans or the environment.
 Pesticides produced before November 1984 continue to be reassessed in order to meet the current scientific and regulatory standards.
 All registered pesticides are reviewed every 15 years to ensure they meet the proper standards.
[52] During the registration process, a label is created.
 The label contains directions for proper use of the material.
 Based on acute toxicity, pesticides are assigned to a Toxicity Class.
 Some pesticides are considered too hazardous for sale to the general public and are designated restricted use pesticides.
 Only certified applicators, who have passed an exam, may purchase or supervise the application of restricted use pesticides.[47] Records of sales and use are required to be maintained and may be audited by government agencies charged with the enforcement of pesticide regulations. needed]
 The EPA regulates pesticides under two under main acts, both of which were amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996.
 In addition to the EPA, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set standards for the level of pesticide residue that is allowed on or in crops [53] The EPA looks at what the potential human health and environmental effects might be associated with the use of the pesticide.[54] pesticide.[54]
 Additionally, the U.S.
 EPA uses the National Research Council's four-step process for human health risk assessment:
 (1) Hazard Identification, (2) Dose-Response Assessment, (3) Exposure Assessment, and (4) Risk Characterization.[55] Characterization.[55]
  HistorySince before 2000 BC, humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops.
 The first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia.
 By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests.
 In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide.
 The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which is derived from the roots of tropical vegetables.[56] Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant.[57] Paul M�ller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide.
 Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S.
 by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975.
 Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide.[57] Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by "triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate".[57] glyphosate".[57]
 The first legislation providing federal authority for regulating pesticides was enacted in 1910;[58] however, decades later during the 1940s manufacturers began to produce large amounts of synthetic pesticides and their use became widespread.[50] Some sources consider the 1940s and 1950s to have been the start of the "pesticide era."[59] Although the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency was established in 1970 and amendments to the pesticide law in 1972,[60] pesticide use has increased 50-fold since 1950 and 2.3 million tonnes (2.5 million short tons) of industrial pesticides are now used each year.[56] Seventy-five percent of all pesticides in the world are used in developed countries, but use in developing countries is increasing.[18] In 2001 the EPA stopped reporting yearly pesticide use statistics.
 A study of USA pesticide use trends through 1997 was published in 2003 by the National Science Foundation's Center for Integrated Pest Management.[57][61] Management.[57][61]
 In the 1960s, it was discovered that DDT was preventing many fish-eating birds from reproducing, which was a serious threat to biodiversity.
 Rachel Carson wrote the best-selling book Silent Spring about biological magnification.
 The agricultural use of DDT is now banned under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, but it is still used in some developing nations to prevent malaria and other tropical diseases by spraying on interior walls to kill or repel mosquitoes.[62] mosquitoes.[62]
 The long-term effects of pesticides on living organisms in rivers and on water quality can now be assessed more easily.
 Researchers from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) have developed a tool that can estimate the harmful effect of pesticides, such as those flushed into rivers and streams from agricultural land, within minutes.

 "It used to be very difficult to detect which chronic effects occur," explains Dr Matthias Liess, head of the UFZ�s System Ecotoxicology Department.
 In their new approach, the Helmholtz researchers exploit the fact that pesticides cause characteristic changes to the composition of the life community that is affected.
 "You just need to find out which living creatures, e.g.
 insects and crabs, are found at a certain point along the river and in what numbers," Liess explains.
 The authorities responsible for water management usually have such data available, he adds.
 Liess and his colleagues have now set up a Web application where this data can be entered and evaluated to show immediately how high the level of pollution in the rivers under investigation actually is.
 Users download an Excel table from the website and then enter the numbers of each kind of organism found at each sampling site.
 Once the table is complete it is fed into the �SPEAR calculator� and the user enters the region in which the samples were taken.
 The calculator immediately shows what the water quality in the area in question is like.
 Regional data is currently available for Germany, France, Finland and Western Siberia, but the system has also been tested in the UK and in Australia.
 There is no charge for using the service.
 Liess believes the authorities can use the calculation results to take suitable steps to reduce pesticide pollution of rivers.
 "But our tool can do more than just identify problem areas," the Helmholtz scientist stresses.
 It also indicates where unpolluted stretches of river are compensating for the effect of the pollution.
 This is extremely important because it can show when conservation methods have been successful.
 Another advantage of the new tool is that in many cases, complex, expensive chemical analyses will no longer be necessary.
 The study was supported by the Environment Agency of England and Wales and by the European Union.
 Pesticides are substances or a mixture of substances, of chemical or biological origin, used by human society to mitigate or repel pests such as bacteria, nematodes, insects, mites, mollusks, birds, rodents, and other organisms that affect food production or human health.
 They usually act by disrupting some component of the pest's life processes to kill or inactivate it.
 In a legal context, pesticides also include substances such as insect attractants, herbicides, plant defoliants, desiccants, and plant growth regulators.
 History of Pesticides Pesticides
 The concept of pesticides is not new.
 Around 1000 B .
 C .
 E .
 Homer referred to the use of sulfur to fumigate homes and by 900 C .
 E .
 the Chinese were using arsenic to control garden pests.
 Although major pest outbreaks have occurred, such as potato blight ( Phytopthora infestans ), which destroyed most potato crops in Ireland during the mid-nineteenth century, not until later that century were pesticides such as arsenic, pyrethrum, lime sulfur, and mercuric mercuric

 chloride used.
 Between this period and World War II, inorganic and biological substances, such as Paris green, lead arsenate, calcium arsenate, selenium compounds, lime�sulfur, pyrethrum, thiram, mercury, copper sulfate, derris, and nicotine were used, but the amounts and frequency of use were limited, and most pest control employed cultural methods such as rotations, tillage, and manipulation of sowing dates.
 After World War II the use of pesticides mushroomed, and there are currently more than 1,600 pesticides available and about 4.4 million tons used annually, at a cost of more than $20 billion.
 The United States accounts for more than 25 percent of this market.
 Older Insecticides Insecticides
 The first synthetic organochlorine insecticide, DDT (dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane), discovered in Switzerland in 1939, was very effective and used extensively to control head and body lice, human disease vectors and agricultural pests, in the decades leading up to the 1970s.
 Benzene hexachloride (BHC) and chlordane were discovered during World War II and toxaphene (and heptachlor) slightly later.
 Shortly thereafter, two cyclodiene organochlorines, aldrin and dieldrin, were introduced, followed by endrin, endosulfan, and isobenzan.
 All these insecticides acted by blocking an insect's nervous system, causing malfunction, tremors, and death.
 All organochlorines are relatively insoluble, persist in soils and aquatic sediments, can bioconcentrate in the tissues of invertebrates and vertebrates from their food, move up trophic chains, and affect top predators.
 These properties of persistence and bioaccumulation led eventually to the withdrawal of registration and use of organochlorine insectides, from 1973 to the late 1990s, in industrialized nations, although they continued to be used in developing countries.
 Organophosphate insecticides originated from compounds developed as nerve gases by Germany during World War II.
 Thus, those developed as insecticides, such as tetraethyl pyrophosphate (TEPP) and parathion, had high mammalian toxicities.
 Scores of other organophosphates including demeton, methyl schradan, phorate, diazinon, disulfoton, dimethoate, trichlorophon, and mevinphos have been registered.
 In insects, as in mammals, they act by inhibiting the enzyme cholinesterase (ChE) that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the nerve synapse, blocking impulses and causing hyperactivity and tetanic paralysis of the insect, then death.
 Some are systemic in plants and animals, but most are not persistent and do not bioaccumulate in animals or have significant environmental impacts.
 Carbaryl, the first carbamate insecticide, acts on nervous transmissions in insects also through effects on cholinesterase by blocking acetylcholine receptors.
 Other carbamate insecticides include aldicarb, methiocarb, methomyl, carbofuran, bendiocarb, and oxamyl.
 In general, although they are broad-spectrum insecticides, of moderate toxicity and persistence, they rarely bioaccumulate or cause major environmental impacts.
 Botanical insecticides include nicotine from tobacco, pyrethrum from chrysanthemums, derris from cabbage, rotenone from beans, sabadilla from lilies, ryania from the ryania shrub, limonene from citrus peel, and neem from the tropical neem tree.
 Most, other than nicotine, have low levels of toxicity in mammals and birds and create few adverse environmental effects.
 Newer Insecticides Insecticides
 Synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, with structures based on the natural compound pyrethrum, were introduced in the 1960s and include tetramethrin, resmethrin, fenvalerate, permethrin, lambda-cyalothrin, and deltamethrin, all used extensively in agriculture.
 They have very low mammalian toxicities and potent insecticidal action, are photostable with low volatilities and persistence.
 They are broad-spectrum insecticides and may kill some natural enemies of pests.
 They do not bioaccumulate and have few effects on mammals, but are very toxic to aquatic invertebrates and fish.
 In recent years, new classes of insecticides have been marketed, none of which are persistent or bioaccumulate.
 They include juvenile hormone mimics, synthetic versions of insect juvenile hormones that act by preventing immature stages of the insects from molting into an adult, and avermectins, natural products produced by soil microorganisms, insecticidal at very low concentrations.
 Bacillus thuringiensis toxins are proteins produced by a bacterium that is pathogenic to insects.
 When activated in the insect gut, they destroy the selective permeability of the gut wall.
 The first strains were toxic only to Lepidoptera, but strains toxic to flies and beetles have since been developed.
 B.
 thuringiensis has been incorporated into plants genetically.
 Nematicides Nematicides
 Soil nematocides , such as dichlopropene, methyl isocyanate, chloropicrin, and methyl bromide, are broad-spectrum soil fumigants.
 Others, aldicarb, dazomet, and metham sodium, act mainly through contact.
 All have very high mammalian toxicities and can kill a wide range of organisms from both the plant and animal kingdoms.
 Although transient in soil, they may have drastic ecological effects on soil systems.
 Molluscicides Molluscicides
 Two molluscicides , metaldehyde and methiocarb, are used as baits against slugs and snails.
 Although of high mammalian toxicity, they cause few problems other than the occasional accidental death of wild mammals.
 Several molluscicides, used to control aquatic snails, N -trityl morpholine, copper sulfate, niclosamine, and sodium pentachlorophenate, are toxic to fish.
 Herbicides Herbicides
 Hormone-type herbicides such as 2,4,5-T; 2,4-D; and MCPA; were discovered during the 1940s.
 They do not persist in soil, are selective in their toxicity to plants, are of low mammalian toxicity, cause few direct environmental problems, but are relatively soluble and reach waterways and groundwater.
 Contact herbicides, which kill weeds through foliage applications, include dintrophenols, cyanophenols, pentachlorophenol, and paraquat.
 Most are nonpersistent, but triazines can persist in the soil for several years, are slightly toxic to soil organisms and moderately so to aquatic organisms.
 Herbicides cause few direct environmental problems other than their indirect effects, in leaving bare soil, which is free of plant cover and susceptible to erosion.
 Fungicides Fungicides
 Many different types of fungicides are used, of widely differing chemical structures.
 Most have relatively low mammalian toxicities, and except for carbamates such as benomyl, a relatively narrow spectrum of toxicity to soil-inhabiting and aquatic organisms.
 Their greatest environmental impact is toxicity to soil microorganisms, but these effects are short term.
 Effects on the Terrestrial Environment Environment
 Pesticides are biocides designed to be toxic to particular groups of organisms.
 They can have considerable adverse environmental effects, which may be extremely diverse:
 sometimes relatively obvious but often extremely subtle and complex.
 Some pesticides are highly specific and others broad spectrum; both types can affect terrestrial wildlife, soil, water systems, and humans.
 Pesticides have had some of their most striking effects on birds, particularly those in the higher trophic levels of food chains, such as bald eagles, hawks, and owls.
 These birds are often rare, endangered, and susceptible to pesticide residues such as those occurring from the bioconcentration of organochlorine insecticides through terrestrial food chains.
 Pesticides may kill grain- and plant-feeding birds, and the elimination of many rare species of ducks and geese has been reported.
 Populations of insect-eating birds such as partridges, grouse, and pheasants have decreased due to the loss of their insect food in agricultural fields through the use of insecticides.
 Bees are extremely important in the pollination of crops and wild plants, and although pesticides are screened for toxicity to bees, and the use of pesticides toxic to bees is permitted only under stringent conditions, many bees are killed by pesticides, resulting in the considerably reduced yield of crops dependent on bee pollination.
 The literature on pest control lists many examples of new pest species that have developed when their natural enemies are killed by pesticides.
 This has created a further dependence on pesticides not dissimilar to drug dependence.
 Finally, the effects of pesticides on the biodiversity of plants and animals in agricultural landscapes, whether caused directly or indirectly by pesticides, constitute a major adverse environmental impact of pesticides.
 Effects on the Aquatic Environment Environment
 The movement of pesticides into surface and groundwater is well documented.
 Wildlife is affected, and human drinking water is sometimes contaminated beyond acceptable safety levels.
 Sediments dredged from U.S.
 waterways are often so heavily contaminated with persistent and other pesticide residues that it becomes problematic to safely dispose of them on land.
 A major environmental impact has been the widespread mortality of fish and marine invertebrates due to the contamination of aquatic systems by pesticides.
 This has resulted from the agricultural contamination of waterways through fallout, drainage, or runoff erosion, and from the discharge of industrial effluents containing pesticides into waterways.
 Historically, most of the fish in Europe's Rhine River were killed by the discharge of pesticides, and at one time fish populations in the Great Lakes became very low due to pesticide contamination.
 Additionally, many of the organisms that provide food for fish are extremely susceptible to pesticides, so the indirect effects of pesticides on the fish food supply may have an even greater effect on fish populations.
 Some pesticides, such as pyrethroid insecticides, are extremely toxic to most aquatic organisms.
 It is evident that pesticides cause major losses in global fish production.
 Effects on Humans Humans
 The most important aspect of pesticides is how they affect humans.
 There is increasing anxiety about the importance of small residues of pesticides, often suspected of being carcinogens or disrupting endocrine activities, in drinking water and food.
 In spite of stringent regulations by international and national regulatory agencies, reports of pesticide residues in human foods, both imported and home-produced, are numerous.
 Over the last fifty years many human illnesses and deaths have occurred as a result of exposure to pesticides, with up to 20,000 deaths reported annually.
 Some of these are suicides, but most involve some form of accidental exposure to pesticides, particularly among farmers and spray operators in developing countries, who are careless in handling pesticides or wear insufficient protective clothing and equipment.
 Moreover, there have been major accidents involving pesticides that have led to the death or illness of many thousands.
 One instance occurred in Bhopal, India, where more than 5,000 deaths resulted from exposure to accidental emissions of methyl isocyanate from a pesticide factory.
 Testing and Reclassification Reclassification
 New pesticides require extensive laboratory and field testing and may take about five years to reach market.
 A pesticide company has to identify uses, test effectiveness, and provide data on chemical structure, production, formulation, fate, persistence, and environmental impacts.
 The product is tested in the laboratory, greenhouse, and field under different environmental conditions.
 After several years of testing, the company submits a registration data package to the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
 Data include studies on acute, chronic, reproductive, and developmental toxicity to mammals, birds, and fish, the pesticide's environmental fate, rates of degradation, translocations to other sites, and ecological studies on its harmful effects to, and on, nontarget plants and animals.
 After its review by government and other scientists, the EPA grants registration of the product for certain uses, with agreed label data and directions for use.
 About 1 in 35,000 chemicals survives from initial laboratory testing to the market, a process that generally takes several years, and involves more than 140 tests.
 The continued use of a pesticide is supervised by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), enacted in 1947 and modified many times since.
 A review may be called for when new evidence indicates possible unreasonable risks to human health or the environment, including toxicity or ill health to humans or animals, hazards to nontarget organisms, and risks to endangered species and suggests that the risks may outweigh the benefits of continued registration.
 After review, the EPA may take no action, alter the pesticide label to minimize risk, reclassify the approved uses or eliminate specific uses, or cancel or suspend the pesticide's registration entirely.
 Pesticides and Food Safety Safety
 Pesticides are used on food crops and meat produced from domestic animals.
 The residues contained within domestically produced food are monitored closely by the EPA, whereas those for imported food are tracked by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture (USDA).
 Scientists determine the highest dose of a pesticide that might be ingested by animals (birds and mammals, including humans) to cause adverse health effects but not death; this is called the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
 They also determine the no-observable-effect level (NOEL) and identify the amount of pesticides that may be safely consumed by humans, in terms of milligrams per kilogram of body weight, over a seventy-year lifetime.
 In calculating an acceptable exposure for a pesticide, scientists usually include a safety factor of one hundred below the NOEL, assuming a lifetime of exposure to the pesticide.
 Such calculations take for granted that a pesticide is applied to all labeled crops, at recommended rates, and that the treated food will be consumed daily for a lifetime.
 Pesticides that have been demonstrated to cause cancer in laboratory animals are not granted tolerance, or approved for application to food crops, based on legislation from Section 409, the socalled Delaney clause, of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and USDA, in addition to many states, have monitoring programs for pesticide residues in food.
 They sample approximately 1 percent of the national food supply.
 For every pesticide, the FDA conducts a total diet study (a market-based survey) to more accurately assess the exposure of the human population to pesticides.
 Similar calculations are made for exposure to pesticides that may reach drinking water through percolation into groundwater or runoff into waterways.
 These adverse effects of pesticides on humans and wildlife have resulted in research into ways of reducing pesticide use.
 The most important of these is the concept of integrated pest management (IPM), first introduced in 1959.
 This combines minimal use of the least harmful pesticides, integrated with biological and cultural methods of minimizing pest losses.
 It is linked with using pesticides only when threshold levels of pest attacks have been identified.
 There is also a move toward sustainable agriculture which aims to minimize use of pesticides and fertilizers based on a systems approach.

 In India organochlorine insecticides such as DDT and HCH constitute more than 70% of the pesticides used at present.
 Its continued use has given interest to monitor for the last few years the extent of organochlorine insecticide residues in soil, water, air and rain water in Delhi area.
 Out of the 50 samples each of soil and earthworms collected from different parts 48 samples showed that soil and earthworms contained 0-2.61 and 0-37.74 mg Kg-1 of total DDT residues respectively.
 The area near the vicinity of the DDT factory showed high levels of DDT residues.
 A two-year survey of the Yamuna river in Delhi showed that water contained an average of 0.24 ug L-1 and the bottom sediment had 0.24 mg Kg-1 of total DDT residues.
 The fishes collected from the Yamuna river showed very high bioaccumulation of DDT residues.
 The air and rainwater samples monitored from 3 different areas for two years indicated that DDT was more near the DDT factory area while HCH was more near a commercial complex.
 These results indicate that the overall organochlorine-residue levels in Delhi is not alarming.
 It probably indicates that DDT and HCH are more rapidly dissipated and degraded in a tropical country like India.
 As an index of pesticide pollution in breast feeding by Indian mothers, milks of woman, buffalo, and goat were analyzed to estimate residues of organochlorine pesticides by gas liquid chromatograph equipped with electron capture detector.
 Contamination in human milk was high as compared with buffalo and goat.
 Concentration of dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane in human milk was 12 times higher than that of buffalo milk and 13 times higher than that of goat milk.
 Residues of hexachlorocyclohexane were correspondingly high in human milk.
 Pesticides are a bigger problem than had long been assumed.
 This is the conclusion of a study in which scientists analysed data on 500 organic substances in the basins of four major European rivers.
 It was revealed that 38 per cent of these chemicals are present in concentrations which could potentially have an effect on organisms.

 According to scientists writing in the journal Science of the Total Environment, this conclusion clearly shows that contamination by organic chemicals is a problem throughout Europe.
 Most of the substances classified as a risk to the environment in the study were pesticides; the majority of these are not on the European list of priority substances which have to be monitored regularly.
 They therefore believe that the list of chemicals specified by the EU Water Framework Directive as having to be monitored by national authorities urgently needs to be revised.
 The aim of the EU Water Framework Directive is that surface water and groundwater bodies should reach a good environmental and chemical status by 2015.
 The chemical status will be assessed based on a list of 33 so-called priority pollutants.
 As over 14 million chemicals are on the market and over 100,000 of these are produced on an industrial scale, the authorities have to confine their monitoring to a manageable number of pollutants.
 Throughout Europe scientists are therefore working on methods to establish which pollutants these should be.
 An important contribution to this has now been made by a study completed by the scientists of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) together with colleagues in France, Slovakia, Belgium and Spain.
 They analysed a database compiled for the EU MODELKEY research project which contains five million records on physicochemical data.
 The study focused on organic pollutants recorded in over 750,000 entries of water analyses in the basins of the Elbe (Czech Republic/Germany), the Danube (10 neighbouring European countries), the Schelde (Belgium) and the Llobregat (Spain) rivers.
 According to the European Commission, this is the first study which has developed a system which has classified organic pollutants on the basis of assessment criteria and the need for action.
 One of the most frequently registered compounds was diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), a chemically-produced softener which may impair fertility and is therefore banned in the EU from 2015.
 This is followed by another softener bisphenol A (BPA), which may also impair fertility, and diclofenac and ibuprofen, two pharmaceutical substances used commonly in painkillers.
 The scientists classified a total of 73 compounds as potential priority pollutants.
 Around two thirds of these are pesticides, i.e.
 products used in agriculture to protect crops against disease, pests and weeds.
 The most problematic pesticides were diazinon, which is already no longer allowed in Germany and Austria, as well as azoxystrobin and terbuthylazine, which are still allowed in Central Europe.
 "Neither of these pesticides is on the list of 33 priority pollutants, which have to be monitored by authorities throughout the EU," explains UFZ researcher Dr.
 C.
 Peter von der Ohe.
 "Terbuthylazine is a compound that is structurally closely related to the priority pollutants simazine and atrazine, which may not be applied any more.
 This is a nice example how small structural modifications of chemical products may apparently improve the chemical status without mitigating any hazards to the aquatic ecosystems." Thus, the scientists strongly support that the priority pollutant list is regularly updated.
 Today the majority of the substances currently presenting problems are not listed, while many of the chemicals being monitored have been banned for some time and are no longer used.
 "We were also surprised that substances previously classified as harmless, such as HHCB, which is used as a synthetic musk fragrance in personal care products, are present in the environment in alarming concentrations," adds Dr.
 Werner Brack of the UFZ, who advises the European Commission in various committees and projects on the revision of the list of priority pollutants.
 "In our opinion the development of the Water Framework Directive should ensure that in future not only the presence of chemical substances but also their effects are monitored," suggests Brack.
 For all of the criticism that the water authorities in Europe are currently paying too little attention to pesticides and that the list of priority pollutants should be revised, in the opinion of the scientists the study also reveals the first successes of the Water Framework Directive.
 One third of the pollutants classified as priority a few years ago by the EU now no longer present a risk to the rivers studied.
 The need of the herbals has become even more pressing for human survival in the present day polluted atmosphere where dangers of slow chemical poisoning are ever present.
 The whole world is becoming aware of the fact that such slow chemical poisoning due to ever-increasing environmental pollution may bring extinction of human race very soon..
 There is a flood of information regarding the dangerous levels of Sulfur dioxide, Hydrocarbons, CFC etc.
 at dangers levels throughout the world.
 However, nothing much is being done to stop the environmental pollution.
 People are also not much aware as to how exactly such gaseous pollution is going to harm and kill them.
 Another far more serious and immediate source of slow chemical poisoning is increasing use of pesticides in agriculture.
 Developing countries are faced with the acute need of increasing agricultural output to meet the increasing populations.
 The public awareness in these countries regarding dangers of pesticide pollution is extremely poor.
 The modern medicines are ineffective against long-term health problems of human beings caused by such chemical poisoning of the environment and consequently the human body.
 It is gradually being recognized that only by use of natural herbs and herbal preparations can we deal with these problems.
 Health Hazards of Pesticide Pesticide
 Pesticides have become a potential hazard of the manufacturer, consumer and the environment.
 Air, water and food have become contaminated with pesticides as result of their extensive misuse.
 The risks to humans may be short-term or long-term, depending on the exposure period to these chemicals.
 The main groups of pesticides of concern are insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and a few soil fumigants.
 Agent Orange, a herbicide that is mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T was used extensively as a defoliant in the Vietnam War in the late sixties.
 People who were residing around the sprayed area at that time and their children still suffer from the adverse health effects.
 Mothers either have stillbirths or give birth to spastics or babies without limbs.
 In India, 147 pesticides are registered for use at present and the tolerance limits of only 50 have been evaluated.
 Therefore, we are at risk not only from the commonly used pesticides whose tolerance limits are known but also from a wide spectrum of pesticides that enter the market and our food commodities without their maximum permissible limits being known.
 In the present scenario, a multidisciplinary integrated approach involving toxicology, epidemiology, physiology and behavioral sciences is essential for the proper assessment of human hazards related to pesticides exposure.
 Poisoning due to pesticides can be occupational e.g.
 in case of workers involved in the manufacturing process, sprayers or farmers.
 It may also be accidental or intentional as in attempted suicide cases.
 The general population is exposed to small quantities of various types of pesticide.
 Even through the daily diet.
 In 1958, Kerala had the first reported case of pesticides poisoning where 100 people died due to parathion poisoning.
 The cases of pesticide poisoning have been reported from the states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Gujarat, Lack of systematic and authentic data on poisoning is a serious hindrance in assessing the impact of pesticide poisoning.
 THE first firm evidence has been uncovered to link environmental pollution with cancer in human beings.
 Re- searchers have found that people with high levels of pesticides and chemicals known as PCBs in their blood streams are far more likely to develop genetic mutations linked with cancer of the pancreas.
 The findings, reported in The Lancet, came as the Government announced plans to carry out strict environmental and health toxicity tests on 1,000 chemicals by 2005.
 Michael Meacher, the Environment Minister, said yesterday:
 "Only a few hundred of the 20,000 chemicals in everyday use have been tested for their impact on health and the environment.
 This is unacceptable." unacceptable."
 There is growing concern about the effects of "gender bender" hormone disrupter chemicals that are feared to be affecting the endocrine system in humans and wildlife.
 Mr Meacher said that the 1,000 target chemicals, ranging from flame retardants to pesticides, amounted to "95 per cent of the total tonnage of all chemicals produced".
 He would be looking closely at the Lancet findings to see if the Government needed to step up action against rhe chemicals concerned.
 The cancer link has been made by Professor M iguel Porta and colleagues at the Municipal Institute of Medical Research and Autonomous University in Barcelona.
 They have been studying compounds known as organochlorines including the pesti- cide DDT, and polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs used historically for insulating and cooling electrical equipment.
 Trace levels of such chemicals are found across the world in food and water.
 They can build up and concentrate in the fat of animals, including human beings.
 The researchers looked at 51 patients with pancreatic cancer and compared blood concentrations of the pollutants and the levels of mutation of a gene called K-Ras, believed to cause pancreatic cancer.
 K- Ras genes have been found to be targets for chemical carcinogens in laboratory studies of animals.
 The team found that people with high blood concentrations of DOT and three common PCBs were more than five times more likely to have a mutation than those with low levels.
 The Lancet adds that the findings offer the "first link ; between the most common genetic alteration in pancreatic cancer and an environmental substance.
 It is also the first time that a mutation of a Ras gene has been associated with serum concentrations of organochlorines in any group of cancer patients." Professor Porta said that the results "suggest new roles for organochlorines in the development of cancers in human beings".
 DDT is banned in Europe but is used in developing countries, from where it is carried to Britain on the wind.
 The Government's new strategy for the chemical industry states that Britain suspended the manufacture of 209 different PCBs in the mid-1970s.
 Europe has set 2010 as the deadline for disposing of its stocks.
 Mr Meacher added that the new PCB findings could lead to an urgent speeding up of European stock destruction.
 and tighter curbs worldwide.
 The minister pointed out that Britain had recently backed moves to ban phthalates, used to make PVC plastic pliable, from toys that babies suck.
 Some teethers and teethingrings still contain phtlalates.
 The Urban Pesticide Pollution Prevention (UP3) Project's goal is to prevent water pollution from urban pesticide use.
 The project is funded by a State Water Resources Control Board grant to the San Francisco Estuary Project.
 The UP3 web site provides resources and information on integrated pest management, pesticides, and water quality, such as municipal program management tools.
 For more information about the UP3 Project, click here.
 UP3 Project Status:
 The UP3 Project has been funded by state and federal grants, and current grant funding will end in 2011.
 The California bond freeze in December, 2008, suspended UP3 Project activities, and support from several key stakeholders allowed the project to restart at a limited level from April-August, 2009.
 Current work is supported by federal stimulus funding.

 The environmental impact of pesticides is often greater than what is intended by those who use them.
 Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including nontarget species, air, water, bottom sediments, and food.
 Pesticide contaminates land and water when it escapes from production sites and storage tanks, when it runs off from fields, when it is discarded, when it is sprayed aerially, and when it is sprayed into water to kill algae.[2] algae.[2]
 The amount of pesticide that migrates from the intended application area is influenced by the particular chemical's properties:
 its propensity for binding to soil, its vapor pressure, its water solubility, and its resistance to being broken down over time.
[3] Factors in the soil, such as its texture, its ability to retain water, and the amount of organic matter contained in it, also affect the amount of pesticide that will leave the area.
[3] Some pesticides contribute to global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer.[4] layer.[4]

 pesticide drift drift
 Pesticides can contribute to air pollution.
 Pesticide drift occurs when pesticides suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them.
[5] Pesticides that are applied to crops can volatilize and may be blown by winds into nearby areas, potentially posing a threat to wildlife.
[6] Also, droplets of sprayed pesticides or particles from pesticides applied as dusts may travel on the wind to other areas,[7] or pesticides may adhere to particles that blow in the wind, such as dust particles.
[8] Ground spraying produces less pesticide drift than aerial spraying does.
[9] Farmers can employ a buffer zone around their crop, consisting of empty land or non-crop plants such as evergreen trees to serve as windbreaks and absorb the pesticides, preventing drift into other areas.
[10] Such windbreaks are legally required in the Netherlands.[10] Netherlands.[10]
  Pesticide use accounts for about 6 percent of total tropospheric ozone levels.[11] levels.[11]
  Water Water
 Pesticide pathwaysIn the United States, pesticides were found to pollute every stream and over 90% of wells sampled in a study by the US Geological Survey.[12] Pesticide residues have also been found in rain and groundwater.
[3] Studies by the UK government showed that pesticide concentrations exceeded those allowable for drinking water in some samples of river water and groundwater.[13] groundwater.[13]
 Pesticide impacts on aquatic systems are often studied using a hydrology transport model to study movement and fate of chemicals in rivers and streams.
 As early as the 1970s quantitative analysis of pesticide runoff was conducted in order to predict amounts of pesticide that would reach surface waters.[14] waters.[14]
 There are four major routes through which pesticides reach the water:
 it may drift outside of the intended area when it is sprayed, it may percolate, or leach, through the soil, it may be carried to the water as runoff, or it may be spilled, for example accidentally or through neglect.
[15] They may also be carried to water by eroding soil.[16] Factors that affect a pesticide's ability to contaminate water include its water solubility, the distance from an application site to a body of water, weather, soil type, presence of a growing crop, and the method used to apply the chemical.
[17] chemical.[17]
 Drainage of fertilizers and pesticides into a streamMaximum limits of allowable concentrations for individual pesticides in public bodies of water are set by the Environmental Protection Agency in the US.
[3][17] Similarly, the government of the United Kingdom sets Environmental Quality Standards (EQS), or maximum allowable concentrations of some pesticides in bodies of water above which toxicity may occur.
[18] The European Union also regulates maximum concentrations of pesticides in water.[18] water.[18]
  Soil Soil
 Caution against entering a field sprayed with sulphuric acidMany of the chemicals used in pesticides are persistent soil contaminants, whose impact may endure for decades and adversely affect soil conservation.[19] conservation.[19]
 The use of pesticides decreases the general biodiversity in the soil.
 Not using the chemicals results in higher soil quality,[verification needed][20] with the additional effect that more organic matter in the soil allows for higher water retention.[3] This helps increase yields for farms in drought years, when organic farms have had yields 20-40% higher than their conventional counterparts.
[21] A smaller content of organic matter in the soil increases the amount of pesticide that will leave the area of application, because organic matter binds to and helps break down pesticides.[3] pesticides.[3]
  Effect on plants plants
 Crop sprayingNitrogen fixation, which is required for the growth of higher plants, is hindered by pesticides in soil.[22] The insecticides DDT, methyl parathion, and especially pentachlorophenol have been shown to interfere with legume-rhizobium chemical signaling.
[22] Reduction of this symbiotic chemical signaling results in reduced nitrogen fixation and thus reduced crop yields.[22] Root nodule formation in these plants saves the world economy $10 billion in synthetic nitrogen fertilizer every year.[23] year.[23]
 Pesticides can kill bees and are strongly implicated in pollinator decline, the loss of species that pollinate plants, including through the mechanism of Colony Collapse Disorder,[24][25][26][27] in which worker bees from a beehive or Western honey bee colony abruptly disappear.
 Application of pesticides to crops that are in bloom can kill honeybees,[5] which act as pollinators.
 The USDA and USFWS estimate that US farmers lose at least $200 million a year from reduced crop pollination because pesticides applied to fields eliminate about a fifth of honeybee colonies in the US and harm an additional 15%. 15%.
 On the other side, pesticides have some direct harmful effect on plant including poor root hair development, shoot yellowing and reduced plant growth [28].
  Effect on animalsPesticides inflict extremely widespread damage to biota, and many countries have acted to discourage pesticide usage through their Biodiversity Action Plans. needed]
 Animals may be poisoned by pesticide residues that remain on food after spraying, for example when wild animals enter sprayed fields or nearby areas shortly after spraying.[9] spraying.[9]
 Widespread application of pesticides can eliminate food sources that certain types of animals need, causing the animals to relocate, change their diet, or starve.
[5] Poisoning from pesticides can travel up the food chain; for example, birds can be harmed when they eat insects and worms that have consumed pesticides.
[5] Some pesticides can bioaccumulate, or build up to toxic levels in the bodies of organisms that consume them over time, a phenomenon that impacts species high on the food chain especially hard.[5] hard.[5]
  Birds Birds
 In England, the use of pesticides in gardens and farmland has seen a reduction in the number of chaffinchesThe Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that 72 million birds are killed by pesticides in the United States each year.
[29] Bald eagles are common examples of nontarget organisms that are impacted by pesticide use.
 Rachel Carson's landmark book Silent Spring dealt with the loss of bird species due to bioaccumulation of pesticides in their tissues.
 There is evidence that birds are continuing to be harmed by pesticide use.
 In the farmland of Britain, populations of ten different species of birds have declined by 10 million breeding individuals between 1979 and 1999, a phenomenon thought to have resulted from loss of plant and invertebrate species on which the birds feed.[30] Throughout Europe, 116 species of birds are now threatened.
[30] Reductions in bird populations have been found to be associated with times and areas in which pesticides are used.
[30] In another example, some types of fungicides used in peanut farming are only slightly toxic to birds and mammals, but may kill off earthworms, which can in turn reduce populations of the birds and mammals that feed on them.[9] them.[9]
 Some pesticides come in granular form, and birds and other wildlife may eat the granules, mistaking them for grains of food.
[9] A few granules of a pesticide is enough to kill a small bird.[9] bird.[9]
 The herbicide paraquat, when sprayed onto bird eggs, causes growth abnormalities in embryos and reduces the number of chicks that hatch successfully, but most herbicides do not directly cause much harm to birds.[9] Herbicides may endanger bird populations by reducing their habitat.[9] habitat.[9]
  Aquatic life life
 Using an aquatic herbicide herbicide
 Wide field margins can reduce fertilizer and pesticide pollution in streams and riversFish and other aquatic biota may be harmed by pesticide-contaminated water.[31] Pesticide surface runoff into rivers and streams can be highly lethal to aquatic life, sometimes killing all the fish in a particular stream.[32] stream.[32]
 Application of herbicides to bodies of water can cause fish kills when the dead plants rot and use up the water's oxygen, suffocating the fish.[31] Some herbicides, such as copper sulfite, that are applied to water to kill plants are toxic to fish and other water animals at concentrations similar to those used to kill the plants.
[31] Repeated exposure to sublethal doses of some pesticides can cause physiological and behavioral changes in fish that reduce populations, such as abandonment of nests and broods, decreased immunity to disease, and increased failure to avoid predators.[31] predators.[31]
 Application of herbicides to bodies of water can kill off plants on which fish depend for their habitat.[31] habitat.[31]
 Pesticides can accumulate in bodies of water to levels that kill off zooplankton, the main source of food for young fish.[33] Pesticides can kill off the insects on which some fish feed, causing the fish to travel farther in search of food and exposing them to greater risk from predators.[31] predators.[31]
 The faster a given pesticide breaks down in the environment, the less threat it poses to aquatic life.[31] Insecticides are more toxic to aquatic life than herbicides and fungicides.[31] fungicides.[31]
  AmphibiansSee also:
 Decline in amphibian population population
 In the past several decades, decline in amphibian populations has been occurring all over the world, for unexplained reasons which are thought to be varied but of which pesticides may be a part.[34] part.[34]
 Mixtures of multiple pesticides appear to have a cumulative toxic effect on frogs.[35] Tadpoles from ponds with multiple pesticides present in the water take longer to metamorphose into frogs and are smaller when they do, decreasing their ability to catch prey and avoid predators.[35] predators.[35]
 A Canadian study showed that exposing tadpoles to endosulfan, an organochloride pesticide at levels that are likely to be found in habitats near fields sprayed with the chemical kills the tadpoles and causes behavioral and growth abnormalities.[36] abnormalities.[36]
 The herbicide atrazine has been shown to turn male frogs into hermaphrodites, decreasing their ability to reproduce.[35] reproduce.[35]
  HumansSee also:
 Pesticide residue residue
 Pesticides are implicated in a range of impacts on human health due to pollutionPesticides can enter the human body through inhalation of aerosols, dust and vapor that contain pesticides; through oral exposure by consuming food and water; and through dermal exposure by direct contact of pesticides with skin.
[37] Pesticides are sprayed onto food, especially fruits and vegetables, they secrete into soils and groundwater which can end up in drinking water, and pesticide spray can drift and pollute the air.
 The effects of pesticides on human health are more harmful based on the toxicity of the chemical and the length and magnitude of exposure.
[38] Farm workers and their families experience the greatest exposure to agricultural pesticides through direct contact with the chemicals.
 But every human contains a percentage of pesticides found in fat samples in their body.
 Children are most susceptible and sensitive to pesticides due to their small size and underdevelopment.[37] The chemicals can bioaccumulate in the body over time.
 Exposure to pesticides can range from mild skin irritation to birth defects, tumors, genetic changes, blood and nerve disorders, endocrine disruption, and even coma or death.[39] death.[39]
  Persistent organic pollutantsMain article:
 Persistent organic pollutant pollutant
 Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are compounds that resist degradation and thus remain in the environment for years.[40] Some pesticides, including aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, mirex, and toxaphene, are considered POPs.
[40] POPs have the ability to volatilize and travel great distances through the atmosphere to become deposited in remote regions.[40] The chemicals also have the ability to bioaccumulate and biomagnify, and can bioconcentrate (i.e.
 become more concentrated) up to 70,000 times their original concentrations.
[40] POPs may continue to poison non-target organisms in the environment and increase risk to humans[41] by disruption in the endocrine, reproductive, and immune systems; cancer; neurobehavioral disorders,[40] infertility and mutagenic effects, although very little is currently known about these chronic effects.
 Some POPs have been banned, while others continue to be used.
  Pest resistanceMain article:
 Pesticide resistance resistance
 Pests may evolve to become resistant to pesticides.
 Many pests will initially be very susceptible to pesticides, but some with slight variations in their genetic makeup are resistant and therefore survive to reproduce.
 Through natural selection, the pests may eventually become very resistant to the pesticide.
 Pest resistance to a pesticide is commonly managed through pesticide rotation, which involves alternating among pesticide classes with different modes of action to delay the onset of or mitigate existing pest resistance.[42] resistance.[42]
 Tank mixing pesticides is the combination of two or more pesticides with different modes of action in order to improve individual pesticide application results and delay the onset of or mitigate existing pest resistance. needed]
  Pest rebound and secondary pest outbreaksNon-target organisms, organisms that the pesticides are not intended to kill, can be severely impacted by use of the chemicals.
 In some cases, where a pest insect has some controls from a beneficial predator or parasite, an insecticide application can kill both pest and beneficial populations.
 A study comparing biological pest control and use of pyrethroid insecticide for diamondback moths, a major cabbage family insect pest, showed that the insecticide application created a rebounded pest population due to loss of insect predators, whereas the biocontrol did not show the same effect.
[43] Likewise, pesticides sprayed in an effort to control adult mosquitoes, may temporarily depress mosquito populations, however they may result in a larger population in the long run by damaging the natural controlling factors.[5] This phenomenon, wherein the population of a pest species rebounds to equal or greater numbers than it had before pesticide use, is called pest resurgence and can be linked to elimination of predators and other natural enemies of the pest.
 Loss of predator species can also lead to a related phenomenon called secondary pest outbreaks, an increase in problems from species which were not originally very damaging pests due to loss of their predators or parasites.[44] An estimated third of the 300 most damaging insects in the US were originally secondary pests and only became a major problem after the use of pesticides.
 In both pest resurgence and secondary pest outbreaks, the natural enemies have been found to be more susceptible to the pesticides than the pests themselves, in some cases causing the pest population to be higher than it was before the use of pesticide.[44] pesticide.[44]
  Eliminating pesticidesMany alternatives are available to reduce the effects pesticides have on the environment.
 There are a variety of alternative pesticides such as manually removing weeds and pests from plants, applying heat, covering weeds with plastic, and placing traps and lures to catch or move pests.
 Pests can be prevented by removing pest breeding sites, maintaining healthy soils which breed healthy plants that are resistant to pests, planting native species that are naturally more resistant to native pests, and use biocontrol agents such as birds and other pest eating organisms.[45] organisms.[45]
 The long-term effects of pesticides on living organisms in rivers and on water quality can now be assessed more easily.
 Researchers from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) have developed a tool that can estimate the harmful effect of pesticides, such as those flushed into rivers and streams from agricultural land, within minutes.

 "It used to be very difficult to detect which chronic effects occur," explains Dr Matthias Liess, head of the UFZ�s System Ecotoxicology Department.
 In their new approach, the Helmholtz researchers exploit the fact that pesticides cause characteristic changes to the composition of the life community that is affected.
 "You just need to find out which living creatures, e.g.
 insects and crabs, are found at a certain point along the river and in what numbers," Liess explains.
 The authorities responsible for water management usually have such data available, he adds.
 Liess and his colleagues have now set up a Web application where this data can be entered and evaluated to show immediately how high the level of pollution in the rivers under investigation actually is.
 Users download an Excel table from the website and then enter the numbers of each kind of organism found at each sampling site.
 Once the table is complete it is fed into the �SPEAR calculator� and the user enters the region in which the samples were taken.
 The calculator immediately shows what the water quality in the area in question is like.
 Regional data is currently available for Germany, France, Finland and Western Siberia, but the system has also been tested in the UK and in Australia.
 There is no charge for using the service.
 Liess believes the authorities can use the calculation results to take suitable steps to reduce pesticide pollution of rivers.
 "But our tool can do more than just identify problem areas," the Helmholtz scientist stresses.
 It also indicates where unpolluted stretches of river are compensating for the effect of the pollution.
 This is extremely important because it can show when conservation methods have been successful.
 Another advantage of the new tool is that in many cases, complex, expensive chemical analyses will no longer be necessary.
 Land pollution is the degradation of Earth's land surfaces often caused by human activities and their misuse of land resources.
 It occurs when waste is not disposed properly.
 Health hazard disposal of urban and industrial wastes, exploitation of minerals, and improper use of soil by inadequate agricultural practices are a few factors.
 Urbanization and industrialization are major causes of land pollution.
 The Industrial Revolution set a series of events into motion which destroyed natural habitats and polluted the environment, causing diseases in both humans and other species of animals.

  Increased mechanizationThe major increase in the concentration of population in cities, along with the internal combustion engine, led to the increased number of roads and all the infrastructure that goes with them.
 As the demand for food has grown exponentially with the increase of the human population, there is an increase in field size and mechanization.
 The increase in field size makes it economically viable for the farmer but results in loss of person and shelter for wildlife, as hedgerows and copses disappear.
 When crops are harvested, the naked soil is left open to wind after it has been compacted by heavy machinery.
 Another consequence of more intensive agriculture is the move to monoculture.
 This is unnatural, will deplete the soil of nutrients, allows diseases and pests to spread and, as it happens, it quickly exhausts all the natural resources in an area, causing the introduction of chemical fertilizers and foreign substances to the soil that poisons it.
 The chemical fertilizers in the soil cause its infertility.
  Pesticides and herbicidesA pesticide is a substance or mixture of substances used to kill a pest.
 A pesticide may be a chemical substance, biological agent (such as a virus or bacteria), antimicrobial, disinfectant or device used against any pest.
 Pests include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, mollusks, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms) and microbes that compete with humans for food, destroy property, spread or are a vector for disease or cause a nuisance.
 Although there are benefits to the use of pesticides, there are also drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other organisms.
 Herbicides are used to kill weeds, especially on pavements and railways.
 They are similar to auxins and most are biodegradable by soil bacteria.
 However, one group derived from trinitrotoluene (2:4 D and 2:4:5 T) have the impurity dioxin, which is very toxic and causes fatality even in low concentrations.
 Another herbicide is Paraquat.
 It is highly toxic but it rapidly degrades in soil due to the action of bacteria and does not kill soil fauna.
 Insecticides are used to rid farms of pests which damage crops.
 The insects damage not only standing crops but also stored ones and in the tropics it is reckoned that one third of the total production is lost during food storage.
 As with fungicides, the first insecticides used in the nineteenth century were inorganic e.g.Paris Green and other compounds of arsenic.
 Nicotine has also been used since the late eighteenth century.
 There are now two main groups of synthetic insecticides - Organochlorines include DDT, Aldrin, Dieldrin and BHC.
 They are cheap to produce, potent and persistent.
 DDT was used on a massive scale from the 1930s, with a peak of 72,000 tonnes used 1970.
 Then usage fell as the harmful environmental effects were realized.
 It was found worldwide in fish and birds and was even discovered in the snow in the Antarctic.
 It is only slightly soluble in water but is very soluble in the bloodstream.
 It affects the nervous and endocrine systems and causes the eggshells of birds to lack calcium causing them to be easily breakable.
 It is thought to be responsible for the decline of the numbers of birds of prey like ospreys and peregrine falcons in the 1950s - they are now recovering.
 As well as increased concentration via the food chain, it is known to enter via permeable membranes, so fish get it through their gills.
 As it has low water solubility, it tends to stay at the water surface, so organisms that live there are most affected.
 DDT found in fish that formed part of the human food chain caused concern, but the levels found in the liver, kidney and brain tissues was less than 1 ppm and in fat was 10 ppm which was below the level likely to cause harm.
 However, DDT was banned in Britain and America to stop the further build up of it in the food chain.
 The USA exploited this ban and sold DDT to developing countries, who could not afford the expensive replacement chemicals and who did not have such stringent regulations governing the use of pesticides.
 Organophosphates, e.g.
 parathion, methyl parathion and about 40 other insecticides are available nationally.
 Parathion is highly toxic, methyl-parathion is less so and Malathion is generally considered safe as it has low toxicity and is rapidly broken down in the mammalian liver.
 This group works by preventing normal nerve transmission as cholinesterase is prevented from breaking down the transmitter substance acetylcholine, resulting in uncontrolled muscle movements.
  MiningModern mining projects leave behind disrupted communities, damaged landscapes, and polluted water.
 Mining also affects ground and surface waters, the aquatic life, vegetation, soils, animals, and the human health.
 Acid mine drainage can cause damage to streams which in return can kill aquatic life.
 The vast variety of toxic chemicals released by mining activities can harm animals and aquatic life as well as their habitat.
 Mining gas and petroleum also pollutes the land.
 Petroleum extraction and manufacturing contaminates the soil with bitumen, gasoline, kerosene and mining brine solutions.
 Opencast mining, which is a process where the surface of the earth is dug open to bring out the underground mineral deposits, destroys the topsoil and contaminates the area with toxic metals and chemicals.
  Increased waste disposalIn Scotland in 1993, 14 million tons of waste was produced.
 100,000 tons was toxic waste and 260,000 tons was controlled waste from other parts of Britain and abroad.
 45% of the special waste was in liquid form and 18% was asbestos - radioactive waste was not included.
 Of the controlled waste, 48% came from the demolition of buildings, 22% from industry, 17% from households and 13% from business - only 3% were recycled.
 90% of controlled waste was buried in landfill sites and produced 2 million tons of methane gas.
 1.5% was burned in incinerators and 1.5% were exported to be disposed of or recycled.
 There are 900 disposal sites in Scotland.
 There are very few vacant or derelict land sites in the north east of Scotland, as there are few traditional heavy industries or coal/mineral extraction sites.
 However some areas are contaminated by aromatic hydrocarbons (500 cubic meters).
 The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive allows sewage sludge to be sprayed onto land and the volume is expected to double to 185,000 tons of dry solids in 2005.
 This has good agricultural properties due to the high nitrogen and phosphate content.
 In 1990/1991, 13% wet weight was sprayed onto 0.13% of the land , however this is expected to rise 15 fold by 2005.
 There is a need to control this so that pathogenic microorganisms do not get into water courses and to ensure that there is no accumulation of heavy metals in the top soil.
  Causes of soil pollution.
 Soil is polluted by many ways:
 1.
 When pollutants get mixed with air, this causes acid rain.
 Acid rain degrades the top soil.
 2.
 Garbage dumping, specially plastics, degrade the soil fertility as they are non biodegradable.
 3.
 Chemical fertilizers and pesticides,when over used pollute the soil and also penetrate into ground water and make it non potable.
 Pesticides are substances or a mixture of substances, of chemical or biological origin, used by human society to mitigate or repel pests such as bacteria, nematodes, insects, mites, mollusks, birds, rodents, and other organisms that affect food production or human health.
 They usually act by disrupting some component of the pest's life processes to kill or inactivate it.
 In a legal context, pesticides also include substances such as insect attractants, herbicides, plant defoliants, desiccants, and plant growth regulators.
 History of Pesticides Pesticides
 The concept of pesticides is not new.
 Around 1000 B .
 C .
 E .
 Homer referred to the use of sulfur to fumigate homes and by 900 C .
 E .
 the Chinese were using arsenic to control garden pests.
 Although major pest outbreaks have occurred, such as potato blight ( Phytopthora infestans ), which destroyed most potato crops in Ireland during the mid-nineteenth century, not until later that century were pesticides such as arsenic, pyrethrum, lime sulfur, and mercuric chloride used.
 Between this period and World War II, inorganic and biological substances, such as Paris green, lead arsenate, calcium arsenate, selenium compounds, lime�sulfur, pyrethrum, thiram, mercury, copper sulfate, derris, and nicotine were used, but the amounts and frequency of use were limited, and most pest control employed cultural methods such as rotations, tillage, and manipulation of sowing dates.
 After World War II the use of pesticides mushroomed, and there are currently more than 1,600 pesticides available and about 4.4 million tons used annually, at a cost of more than $20 billion.
 The United States accounts for more than 25 percent of this market.
 Older Insecticides Insecticides
 The first synthetic organochlorine insecticide, DDT (dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane), discovered in Switzerland in 1939, was very effective and used extensively to control head and body lice, human disease vectors and agricultural pests, in the decades leading up to the 1970s.
 Benzene hexachloride (BHC) and chlordane were discovered during World War II and toxaphene (and heptachlor) slightly later.
 Shortly thereafter, two cyclodiene organochlorines, aldrin and dieldrin, were introduced, followed by endrin, endosulfan, and isobenzan.
 All these insecticides acted by blocking an insect's nervous system, causing malfunction, tremors, and death.
 All organochlorines are relatively insoluble, persist in soils and aquatic sediments, can bioconcentrate in the tissues of invertebrates and vertebrates from their food, move up trophic chains, and affect top predators.
 These properties of persistence and bioaccumulation led eventually to the withdrawal of registration and use of organochlorine insectides, from 1973 to the late 1990s, in industrialized nations, although they continued to be used in developing countries.
 Organophosphate insecticides originated from compounds developed as nerve gases by Germany during World War II.
 Thus, those developed as insecticides, such as tetraethyl pyrophosphate (TEPP) and parathion, had high mammalian toxicities.
 Scores of other organophosphates including demeton, methyl schradan, phorate, diazinon, disulfoton, dimethoate, trichlorophon, and mevinphos have been registered.
 In insects, as in mammals, they act by inhibiting the enzyme cholinesterase (ChE) that breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the nerve synapse, blocking impulses and causing hyperactivity and tetanic paralysis of the insect, then death.
 Some are systemic in plants and animals, but most are not persistent and do not bioaccumulate in animals or have significant environmental impacts.
 Carbaryl, the first carbamate insecticide, acts on nervous transmissions in insects also through effects on cholinesterase by blocking acetylcholine receptors.
 Other carbamate insecticides include aldicarb, methiocarb, methomyl, carbofuran, bendiocarb, and oxamyl.
 In general, although they are broad-spectrum insecticides, of moderate toxicity and persistence, they rarely bioaccumulate or cause major environmental impacts.
 Botanical insecticides include nicotine from tobacco, pyrethrum from chrysanthemums, derris from cabbage, rotenone from beans, sabadilla from lilies, ryania from the ryania shrub, limonene from citrus peel, and neem from the tropical neem tree.
 Most, other than nicotine, have low levels of toxicity in mammals and birds and create few adverse environmental effects.
 Newer Insecticides Insecticides
 Synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, with structures based on the natural compound pyrethrum, were introduced in the 1960s and include tetramethrin, resmethrin, fenvalerate, permethrin, lambda-cyalothrin, and deltamethrin, all used extensively in agriculture.
 They have very low mammalian toxicities and potent insecticidal action, are photostable with low volatilities and persistence.
 They are broad-spectrum insecticides and may kill some natural enemies of pests.
 They do not bioaccumulate and have few effects on mammals, but are very toxic to aquatic invertebrates and fish.
 In recent years, new classes of insecticides have been marketed, none of which are persistent or bioaccumulate.
 They include juvenile hormone mimics, synthetic versions of insect juvenile hormones that act by preventing immature stages of the insects from molting into an adult, and avermectins, natural products produced by soil microorganisms, insecticidal at very low concentrations.
 Bacillus thuringiensis toxins are proteins produced by a bacterium that is pathogenic to insects.
 When activated in the insect gut, they destroy the selective permeability of the gut wall.
 The first strains were toxic only to Lepidoptera, but strains toxic to flies and beetles have since been developed.
 B.
 thuringiensis has been incorporated into plants genetically.
 Nematicides Nematicides
 Soil nematocides , such as dichlopropene, methyl isocyanate, chloropicrin, and methyl bromide, are broad-spectrum soil fumigants.
 Others, aldicarb, dazomet, and metham sodium, act mainly through contact.
 All have very high mammalian toxicities and can kill a wide range of organisms from both the plant and animal kingdoms.
 Although transient in soil, they may have drastic ecological effects on soil systems.
 Molluscicides Molluscicides
 Two molluscicides , metaldehyde and methiocarb, are used as baits against slugs and snails.
 Although of high mammalian toxicity, they cause few problems other than the occasional accidental death of wild mammals.
 Several molluscicides, used to control aquatic snails, N -trityl morpholine, copper sulfate, niclosamine, and sodium pentachlorophenate, are toxic to fish.
 Herbicides Herbicides
 Hormone-type herbicides such as 2,4,5-T; 2,4-D; and MCPA; were discovered during the 1940s.
 They do not persist in soil, are selective in their toxicity to plants, are of low mammalian toxicity, cause few direct environmental problems, but are relatively soluble and reach waterways and groundwater.
 Contact herbicides, which kill weeds through foliage applications, include dintrophenols, cyanophenols, pentachlorophenol, and paraquat.
 Most are nonpersistent, but triazines can persist in the soil for several years, are slightly toxic to soil organisms and moderately so to aquatic organisms.
 Herbicides cause few direct environmental problems other than their indirect effects, in leaving bare soil, which is free of plant cover and susceptible to erosion.
 Fungicides Fungicides
 Many different types of fungicides are used, of widely differing chemical structures.
 Most have relatively low mammalian toxicities, and except for carbamates such as benomyl, a relatively narrow spectrum of toxicity to soil-inhabiting and aquatic organisms.
 Their greatest environmental impact is toxicity to soil microorganisms, but these effects are short term.
 Effects on the Terrestrial Environment Environment
 Pesticides are biocides designed to be toxic to particular groups of organisms.
 They can have considerable adverse environmental effects, which may be extremely diverse:
 sometimes relatively obvious but often extremely subtle and complex.
 Some pesticides are highly specific and others broad spectrum; both types can affect terrestrial wildlife, soil, water systems, and humans.
 Pesticides have had some of their most striking effects on birds, particularly those in the higher trophic levels of food chains, such as bald eagles, hawks, and owls.
 These birds are often rare, endangered, and susceptible to pesticide residues such as those occurring from the bioconcentration of organochlorine insecticides through terrestrial food chains.
 Pesticides may kill grain- and plant-feeding birds, and the elimination of many rare species of ducks and geese has been reported.
 Populations of insect-eating birds such as partridges, grouse, and pheasants have decreased due to the loss of their insect food in agricultural fields through the use of insecticides.
 Bees are extremely important in the pollination of crops and wild plants, and although pesticides are screened for toxicity to bees, and the use of pesticides toxic to bees is permitted only under stringent conditions, many bees are killed by pesticides, resulting in the considerably reduced yield of crops dependent on bee pollination.
 The literature on pest control lists many examples of new pest species that have developed when their natural enemies are killed by pesticides.
 This has created a further dependence on pesticides not dissimilar to drug dependence.
 Finally, the effects of pesticides on the biodiversity of plants and animals in agricultural landscapes, whether caused directly or indirectly by pesticides, constitute a major adverse environmental impact of pesticides.
 Effects on the Aquatic Environment Environment
 The movement of pesticides into surface and groundwater is well documented.
 Wildlife is affected, and human drinking water is sometimes contaminated beyond acceptable safety levels.
 Sediments dredged from U.S.
 waterways are often so heavily contaminated with persistent and other pesticide residues that it becomes problematic to safely dispose of them on land.
 A major environmental impact has been the widespread mortality of fish and marine invertebrates due to the contamination of aquatic systems by pesticides.
 This has resulted from the agricultural contamination of waterways through fallout, drainage, or runoff erosion, and from the discharge of industrial effluents containing pesticides into waterways.
 Historically, most of the fish in Europe's Rhine River were killed by the discharge of pesticides, and at one time fish populations in the Great Lakes became very low due to pesticide contamination.
 Additionally, many of the organisms that provide food for fish are extremely susceptible to pesticides, so the indirect effects of pesticides on the fish food supply may have an even greater effect on fish populations.
 Some pesticides, such as pyrethroid insecticides, are extremely toxic to most aquatic organisms.
 It is evident that pesticides cause major losses in global fish production.
 Effects on Humans Humans
 The most important aspect of pesticides is how they affect humans.
 There is increasing anxiety about the importance of small residues of pesticides, often suspected of being carcinogens or disrupting endocrine activities, in drinking water and food.
 In spite of stringent regulations by international and national regulatory agencies, reports of pesticide residues in human foods, both imported and home-produced, are numerous.
 Over the last fifty years many human illnesses and deaths have occurred as a result of exposure to pesticides, with up to 20,000 deaths reported annually.
 Some of these are suicides, but most involve some form of accidental exposure to pesticides, particularly among farmers and spray operators in developing countries, who are careless in handling pesticides or wear insufficient protective clothing and equipment.
 Moreover, there have been major accidents involving pesticides that have led to the death or illness of many thousands.
 One instance occurred in Bhopal, India, where more than 5,000 deaths resulted from exposure to accidental emissions of methyl isocyanate from a pesticide factory.
 Testing and Reclassification Reclassification
 New pesticides require extensive laboratory and field testing and may take about five years to reach market.
 A pesticide company has to identify uses, test effectiveness, and provide data on chemical structure, production, formulation, fate, persistence, and environmental impacts.
 The product is tested in the laboratory, greenhouse, and field under different environmental conditions.
 After several years of testing, the company submits a registration data package to the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
 Data include studies on acute, chronic, reproductive, and developmental toxicity to mammals, birds, and fish, the pesticide's environmental fate, rates of degradation, translocations to other sites, and ecological studies on its harmful effects to, and on, nontarget plants and animals.
 After its review by government and other scientists, the EPA grants registration of the product for certain uses, with agreed label data and directions for use.
 About 1 in 35,000 chemicals survives from initial laboratory testing to the market, a process that generally takes several years, and involves more than 140 tests.
 The continued use of a pesticide is supervised by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), enacted in 1947 and modified many times since.
 A review may be called for when new evidence indicates possible unreasonable risks to human health or the environment, including toxicity or ill health to humans or animals, hazards to nontarget organisms, and risks to endangered species and suggests that the risks may outweigh the benefits of continued registration.
 After review, the EPA may take no action, alter the pesticide label to minimize risk, reclassify the approved uses or eliminate specific uses, or cancel or suspend the pesticide's registration entirely.
 Pesticides and Food Safety Safety
 Pesticides are used on food crops and meat produced from domestic animals.
 The residues contained within domestically produced food are monitored closely by the EPA, whereas those for imported food are tracked by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture (USDA).
 Scientists determine the highest dose of a pesticide that might be ingested by animals (birds and mammals, including humans) to cause adverse health effects but not death; this is called the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
 They also determine the no-observable-effect level (NOEL) and identify the amount of pesticides that may be safely consumed by humans, in terms of milligrams per kilogram of body weight, over a seventy-year lifetime.
 In calculating an acceptable exposure for a pesticide, scientists usually include a safety factor of one hundred below the NOEL, assuming a lifetime of exposure to the pesticide.
 Such calculations take for granted that a pesticide is applied to all labeled crops, at recommended rates, and that the treated food will be consumed daily for a lifetime.
 Pesticides that have been demonstrated to cause cancer in laboratory animals are not granted tolerance, or approved for application to food crops, based on legislation from Section 409, the socalled Delaney clause, of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and USDA, in addition to many states, have monitoring programs for pesticide residues in food.
 They sample approximately 1 percent of the national food supply.
 For every pesticide, the FDA conducts a total diet study (a market-based survey) to more accurately assess the exposure of the human population to pesticides.
 Similar calculations are made for exposure to pesticides that may reach drinking water through percolation into groundwater or runoff into waterways.
 These adverse effects of pesticides on humans and wildlife have resulted in research into ways of reducing pesticide use.
 The most important of these is the concept of integrated pest management (IPM), first introduced in 1959.
 This combines minimal use of the least harmful pesticides, integrated with biological and cultural methods of minimizing pest losses.
 It is linked with using pesticides only when threshold levels of pest attacks have been identified.
 There is also a move toward sustainable agriculture which aims to minimize use of pesticides and fertilizers based on a systems approach.

 The lush fields are a far cry from how things were several years ago, which is what prompted members of the farming project to step in and work with the farmers to find a solution.
 �The land was becoming infertile, and generally it was a very pessimistic scenario all around,� says S.K., a technical advisor with the project.
 �We felt that we needed to create a system to help the farmers earn a livelihood for themselves.
 It just made more sense to take a step back � on one hand helping us develop better quality cotton, and on the other hand helping the farmer have a sustainable livelihood.� livelihood.�
 Organic farming was the solution they were looking for.
 Consultants with the project taught these farmers natural methods for everything from creating pest-resistant seeds to amending the soil with nutrients.
 The project has also helped the village become completely self-sustainable.
 Nothing gets wasted, not even oxen dung � it�s put in a biogas chamber, which turns it into methane gas that provides power to the whole community.
 Oxen urine also has a use.
 It is applied to the seeds, along with bacteria cultures, to make them pest-resistant.
 Organic farming is more labor-intensive, but the technical consultants with the project say the hard work is paying off with lower farming costs, higher prices for organically grown cotton and a better life for everyone in the community.
 They�re even enjoying an increase in the number of cotton cycles they get out of a single plant.
 They used to get only one.
 Now, because they use non-genetically modified seeds, they get up to five.
 �Ever since we started organic farming, we have found the nutrient value of the land is returning,� S.K.
 says.
 �We are finding the production numbers are going up.
 People have more income, and they are healthier.� healthier.�
 analytical methods, ELISA, SPME and SPE, the cost appraisal found SPME to have the lowest cost per sample (R253.86), followed by SPE (R329.86), while ELISA had the highest cost per sample, appreciably higher than SPME.
 For all three methods, the annualised capital cost was low and formed a low percentage (5-9%) of the total annual cost.
 Recurrent costs therefore formed the bulk of the costs of all three methods, with transport costs high for all three methods, and personnel costs for SPE and SPME being substantially higher than ELISA.
 The cost of materials were high for ELISA (R 240 per sample).
 Sensitivity analysis showed that if the full cost of capital items (as totally dedicated to the analyses of the 384 annual samples) were included then the cost per sample for all methods increases substantially.
 ELISA would then rise to R450.66, for SPE to R429.86 and SPME to R502.01.
 In order to obtain the low cost per sample quoted above, 786 samples per annum are required for ELISA and 3200 samples per annum for SPE and SPME.
 Despite an a priori expectation that the ELISA would be a useful method if there was sufficient economy of scale, costing analysis has shown that there is little to save with high volumes of tests since the highest costs for ELISA are not personnel but reagents.
 Moreover, given that SPME and SPE produce quantitative data with good detection limits (SPME 0.01-0.02 �g/L), and that the ELISA measurements are semi-quantitative, there appears to be little advantage to promoting the wider use of ELISA's at this stage.
 The costs associated with using the autosampler compared to TWA for obtaining an integrated estimate for 24 hours were almost twice (R1707) that of the TWA derived from the SPME fibre (R865), largely because of the capital costs of the autosampler and time required to analyse each sample.
 The use of the autosampler in the field combined with laboratory SPME and GC analysis yields a quantitavely superior result compared to the use of the SPME fibre for in-field TWA sampling.
 However, it is evident that neither of these two methods are presently feasible for routine use in monitoring due to the logistics and costs associated with the collection and analyses of samples.
 Further investigation would be needed to establish their utility in improving the characterisation of rural water contamination before such high costs could be considered, or further refinements need to be developed to reduce costs.
 SURVEY ON THE CAPACITY OF RURAL COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO IMPLEMENT MONITORING OF WATER SOURCES FOR PESTICIDES PESTICIDES
 In order to implement monitoring of pesticides in water, it is important to evaluate the capacity of rural local authorities in the Western Cape and other public sector responsible for water management.
 The survey was intended to characterise the knowledge, perceptions and practices of rural target groups in relation to pesticide pollution of water, and to identify needs for training, technical and logistic support.
 A cross-sectional survey of farm workers, environmental health officers (EHOs), local authority management, rural NGOs and Government department staff was planned to meet these objectives.
 Questionnaire development, and field interviews of local authority officials and farm workers was undertaken by environmental health students from PENTECH supervised by 2 senior researchers from PENTECH and one from UCT.
 The survey was conducted during September and October 2001.
 For logistic reasons, local authorities and farms were surveyed separately, and different questionnaires were applied.
 Final participants in the study included 8 EHOs.
 These participants were drawn from 7 rural farming districts in the Western Cape, which cover 21 towns with a total population of 503 000 From the management of water quality perspective, it was reported that in all 7 districts surveyed, water sources on farms are tested by EHOs.
 While the number of EHO's per district varies according to the population in the area, it is clear that in some areas there is a shortage of personnel.
 Only 3 (37%) of respondents felt that there were enough persons conducting water monitoring in their area.
 All respondents indicated that the costs of monitoring are borne by the local municipality, and only one respondent indicated that private farm owners may cover the cost if they request testing.
 Feedback of results of pesticide analysis was not common (only one respondent), while feedback to the farmer after request was relatively common (3/7 respondents).
 The 63 farm personnel who participated in the study, included 6 sprayers (10%), 35 managers (57%) and 20 other workers (33%).
 They resided on 16 farms in 3 districts.
 Farm personnel reported their main water source for domestic use as being boreholes (25%), dams or rivers (44%), mountain springs (16%), rain water (19%) or reticulated water via municipal systems (19%).
 Unprotected sources for domestic water use was cited as canal water (13%), river or dam water (44%), and irrigation water (6%),).
 Farm personnel from 8 (50%) out of 16 farms indicated that water was tested on their farms.
 Four (50%) reported that water was tested for chemicals, 4 (50%) mentioned bacteria, 1 (13%) mentioned pH and 4 (50%) mentioned colour.
 However, the veracity of these reports could not be confirmed, and it is extremely unlikely that pesticides are tested on 50% of farms in the region.
 This is borne out by responses from farm personnel when asked who carried out testing, they indicated mainly non-statutory bodies or individuals (6 of the 8 farms).
 Regularity of testing varied widely from once daily (n=1) to once yearly (n=2).
 Although water monitoring was mentioned by respondents, a number of problems emerged.
 General monitoring appeared to take place relatively inconsistently in farming areas, and no monitoring for pesticides was reported.
 Although EHO's stated that they had a good knowledge of the health hazards of pesticides, there was a shortage of staff in many areas and there were not enough laboratories in the Western Cape to conduct pesticide water analysis.
 Lack of feedback to owners on results of analyses also appeared to be an area in need of intervention.
 THE DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES FOR PESTICIDE MONITORING OF RURAL WATER WATER
 A guideline document for use by rural communities and/or rural local authorities which sets out relevant aspects for conducting pesticide water monitoring is important in the context of this study which aims to develop screening methods for the pesticide monitoring of water.
 However, it was probably somewhat ambitious to try to produce both new technologies (methods for analysis, and instruments for integrating exposure in the field) as well as to recommend procedures based on these new technologies.
 For this reason, the project has been limited to recommendations on how a guideline document may be developed.
 It is based on the results of analyses of screening methods developed in Chapters 2-4, and the costs associated with these methods detailed in Chapter 5.
 The guidelines also reflect on the findings discussed in Chapter 6, in conjunction with the WRC project No.
 K5/795/00, of the capacity within rural communities to conduct water monitoring monitoring
 The proposed guideline document would take into account factors which would optimise its utility in addition to content.
 Factors optimising the utility include physical structure and comprehensibility which should be undertaken with the assistance of language and media consultants.
 The content areas of the proposed guideline document should start by setting out a brief background on pesticide water pollution, with reference to WRC project No.
 795/1/00 for additional information The guideline document will include sections covering the following:
 purpose of the document document
 identification of target goups and potential applications applications
 knowledge required before sampling for pesticides can take place place
 identification of areas and sites sites
 identification of pesticides to be monitored.
 procedures to follow and equipment required required
 methods available for analysis analysis
 selection of laboratories and analysis of samples samples
 interpretation of results, and and
 management of water polluted by pesticides.
 CONCLUSIONS CONCLUSIONS
 This project sought to establish new methods of pesticide analysis for monitoring of rural water sources, and to use these data to strengthen capacity for rural communities to monitor their own water sources.
 These objectives were only partly fulfilled in the course of the project.
 Clearly what has emerged is the utility of SPME fibres as a method of analysis for organic compounds, specifically two pesticides, chlorpyrifos and endosulfan, in water.
 The method produces cost-effective analyses of high sensitivity and repeatability.
 Extending the use of the SPME fibres to produce a field device which would give an integrated estimate of water pollution has only been partly successful in this project.
 A theoretical model of the rate of absorption of an analyte (pesticide) into the fibre coating, in a particular physical configuration, has been developed and tested using a prototype field device.
 Data produced in this project, though, has been too limited to draw any conclusions as to the validity or usefulness of the approach.
 Further research is recommended to overcome the problem of analyte retention during the extended sampling period, and to assess the importance of temperature control of sampling conditions in the field.
 As for ELISA analysis, it is unlikely, based on the preliminary work conducted in this project, that ELISA analysis could become a useful adjunct in pesticide monitoring.
 Costs are high, much higher than anticipated in the literature, and accuracy weak.
 The use of ELISA even as a routine screening method could not be supported by the present associated costs.
 Rural capacity to monitor pesticides remains limited, although awareness, as demonstrated in this and previous studies, is high.
 Costs are the chief barrier, and future work to reduce such costs will be the rate-limiting step for any widespread adoption of monitoring.
 However, the value of developing tools that give rural communities, local authorities, farmers and farm workers the capacity to initiate, coordinate, understand and interpret monitoring for pesticides in water, is highly desirable.
 RECOMMENDATIONS RECOMMENDATIONS
 There is a need to develop pesticide monitoring methods with a view to the implementation of future full-scale monitoring.
 In particular, further development of the validity of the calculation adjusting for the loss factor, in-fibre derivation, and/or chemically fixing the absorbed analyte which was beyond the scope of the present project, should be explored in future research to establish integrated methods of monitoring pesticides.
 Development of in-house plate kits which could substantially reduce costs associated with ELISA could be explored.
 The preamble guidelines for monitoring pesticides in water developed in this study, should be further developed.
 The capacity of State laboratories to measure pesticide water pollution at low levels (0.01 mg/L) using either SPE or SPME methods needs to be enhanced, especially if routine monitoring is implemented.
 The problem of lack of feedback to farmers of the water results should be addressed.
 It is important for farm residents to be informed about pesticide pollution of water and about the possible adverse health effects of pesticides.
 This could best be done by the farmer, farming co-op or supplier.
 The pesticides belong to a category of chemicals used worldwide as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, ro-denticides, molluscicides, nematicides, and plant growth regulators in order to control weeds, pests and dis-eases in crops as well as for health care of humans and animals.
 The positive aspect of application of pesti-cides renders enhanced crop/food productivity and drastic reduction of vector-borne diseases.
 However, their unregulated and indiscriminate applications have raised serious concerns about the entire environment in general and the health of humans, birds and animals in particular.
 Despite ban on application of some of the environmentally persistent and least biodegradable pesticides (like organochlorines) in many countries, their use is ever on rise.
 Pesticides cause serious health hazards to living systems because of their rapid fat solu-bility and bioaccumulation in non-target organisms.
 Even at low concentration, pesticides may exert several adverse effects, which could be monitored at biochemical, molecular or behavioral levels.
 The factors af-fecting water pollution with pesticides and their residues include drainage, rainfall, microbial activity, soil temperature, treatment surface, application rate as well as the solubility, mobility and half life of pesticides.
 In India organochlorine insecticides such as DDT and HCH constitute more than 70% of the pesticides used at present.
 Reports from Delhi, Bhopal and other cities and some rural areas have indicated presence of sig-nificant level of pesticides in fresh water systems as well as bottled drinking mineral water samples.
 The ef-fects of pesticides pollution in riverine systems and drinking water in India has been discussed in this review.
 In California, pesticide pollution is responsible for 27 percent of the state's waters being designated as unfit for drinking, swimming, and fishing under the Clean Water Act.
 Nationally, over 1,000 waterways are known to be polluted by pesticides at levels that are harmful to fish, wildlife, and human health.
 Pesticide applicators are required to get Clean Water Act permits before spraying toxic pesticides on or near the nation's waterways.
 But current efforts in the US Senate, initiated by the chemical industry lobbyists, are attempting to undermine these environmental protections by eliminating EPA's authority to issue permits to protect our watersheds from pesticide pollution.
 More than 2,800 online shoppers across the US have been warned by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about potentially serious risks that are linked to a banned substance found in an ant killing product that has been sold online at fastpestcontrol.com.
 Known as Fast Ant Bait, the product contains the pesticide mirex, which was banned during the late 1970s after being associated with reproductive, liver, nerve and skin damage.
 According to Steve Owens, assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, ''Illegal pesticides are often much more toxic than approved pesticides.
 When the EPA takes a pesticide off the market, it means that pesticide was not safe.
 Consumers should use only EPA-registered pesticides and always follow the label directions to ensure their safety.'' safety.''
 The EPA was recently made aware of problems associated with the ant control product after the state's Department of Health reported that a Washington woman got sick after using the pesticide to solve an ant problem in her home.
 After the further investigation, the EPA decided to take action and begin working to track down and issue warnings to the three online companies that have been processing orders for and shipping the product into the US, including 2Checkout.com, Inc., CCNow, Inc.
 and eBay Inc.
 The companies were ordered to stop importing the product, which is being produced in and shipped from China.
 All three of the companies agreed to cooperate fully and immediately stopped taking orders for products being shipped from fastpestcontrol.com.
 In addition, they supplied the EPA with the contact information and names of all customers who had purchased the products.
 The agency has attempted to contact all affected parties via a detailed letter to let them know about the dangers of exposure to the pesticide, as well as to advise them of the correct methods for disposal and the proper steps to take if exposure to the pesticide had already occurred.

 Fumigation is a method of pest control that completely fills an area with gaseous pesticides�or fumigants�to suffocate or poison the pests within.
 It is utilized for control of pests in buildings (structural fumigation), soil, grain, and produce, and is also used during processing of goods to be imported or exported to prevent transfer of exotic organisms.
 This method also affects the structure itself, affecting pests that inhabit the physical structure, such as woodborers and drywood termites. termites.

  ProcessFumigation usually involves the following phases:
 First the area to be fumigated is usually covered to create a sealed environment; next the fumigant is released into the space to be fumigated; then, the space is held for a set period while the fumigant gas percolates through the space and acts on and kills any infestation in the product, next the space is ventilated so that the poisonous gases are allowed to escape from the space, and render it safe for humans to enter.
  Tent fumigation (Tenting)Structural fumigating techniques differ from building to building, but in houses a rubber tent is often placed over the entire house while the pesticides are being released into the vacant residence.
 This process is called tent fumigation or "tenting".
 The sealed tent concentrates the poisonous gases and prevents them from escaping into the neighborhood.
 The process can take up to a week depending on the fumigant used, which in turn depend on the severity of infestation and size of the building.
  ChemicalsMethyl bromide was among the most widely used fumigants until its production and use was restricted by the Montreal Protocol due to its role in ozone depletion.[2][3] depletion.[2][3]
 Widely used fumigants include:
 phosphine phosphine
 1,3-dichloropropene 1,3-dichloropropene
 chloropicrin chloropicrin
 methyl isocyanate isocyanate
 hydrogen cyanide cyanide
 sulfuryl fluoride fluoride
 formaldehyde formaldehyde
 Iodoform Iodoform
  SafetyFumigation is a hazardous operation.
 Generally it is a legal requirement that the operator, carrying out the fumigation operation, holds official certification to perform the fumigation as the chemicals used are toxic to most forms of life, including humans. humans.
 Post operation ventilation of the area is a critical safety aspect of fumigation.
 It is important to distinguish between the pack or source of the fumigant gas and the environment which has been fumigated.
 While the fumigant pack may be safe and spent, the space will still hold the fumigant gas until it has been ventilated.
 Implementation of Risk Mitigation Measures for Soil Fumigant Pesticides Pesticides
 Current as of October 2011 2011
 Soil Fumigant Toolbox Toolbox
 Welcome to the Soil Fumigant Toolbox which provides training, outreach, and other resource materials for applicators and handlers, communities, state and local agencies, and others interested in understanding and implementing the current requirements for safe use of soil fumigants.
 HOW TO FUMIGATE A HOUSE SAFELY SAFELY
 The golden rule is...follow the directions provided with the fogging bomb precisely.
 1.
 Fumigate or BOMB just the rooms of a house:
 If you have the need to fumigate or what is called bomb the rooms to get rid of pests, you MUST follow the directions on the pesticide bomb.
 This is also called "fogging" the house." The University of Kentucky experts advise...
 NO FLAMES:
 The ingredients in aerosol insecticide products may be flammable when used or stored near open flame.
 There have been a number of house fires involving insect foggers when homeowners neglected to extinguish pilot lights, cigarettes, etc.
 It is generally poor practice to allow pesticide residues to settle onto counter tops, bedding, toys, pet food dishes, and other exposed surfaces.
 While the directions for use accompanying total-release foggers specify that exposed food, utensils, and food preparation equipment and surfaces be covered and cleaned before reuse, many homeowners fail to read and follow these instructions.
 The extent to which the resultant pesticide residues on exposed surfaces constitute a health hazard is debatable and would depend on various factors.
 A potentially greater hazard is pyrethrum, a common ingredient in bug bombs which is often touted as being �natural� and �safe� since it is derived from chrysanthemum flowers.
 Occupants with asthma and other respiratory ailments can react severely when pyrethrins and other irritating, volatile compounds are used indoors.
 According to label instructions, people and pets are not supposed to remain in the treated area, but are not necessarily required to leave the house.
 Most foggers are designed to be placed in the center of a room on a chair or table, and activated by depressing or removing a tab at the top of the can.
 The entire contents are released upwards, into the airspace, where the aerosol droplets remain suspended for a period of time and then gradually settle onto floors, counter tops and other surfaces.
 Prior to application, drawers, cabinets and closets are supposed to be opened to enhance coverage in areas where pests are likely to be living.
 When applied in this manner, very little insecticide actually penetrates into cracks, voids, and other hidden locations where cockroaches, ants, silverfish, and most other household pests congregate and spend most of their time.
 Many insect foggers contain pyrethrin as their primary active ingredient.
 While pyrethrins are somewhat effective against exposed flying insects such as mosquitoes and house flies, they are seldom lethal to cockroaches, ants, spiders, beetles, and other crawling pests.
 The ingredients within �bug bombs� also tend to be repellent, causing insects to scatter and move deeper into wall voids and other hard-to-reach areas.
 2.
 Fumigate the entire house:
 That means every air space...that is why a house is wrapped to do the fumigation.
 This is a job for "superman"...that means you can't do it.
 Call a professional and have them do it for you safely and effectively.
 Finally, fogging may not be legal for you to do in your community.
 Check your local laws before you try to get rid of any pests by fogging.
 This document provides a general overview of human toxicity, a listing of laboratory animal and wildlife toxicities, and a cross reference of chemical, common and trade names of phosphorous and sulfur fumigants registered for use in Florida.
 General General
 These groups of fumigants have been used for many years throughout the world, including the United States.
 The chemical family of phosphorous fumigants consists of two members � aluminum and magnesium phosphide, both of which liberate phosphine gas, while sulfuryl fluoride is a sulfur-based material.
 As a fumigant group, they are some of the most important pest control tools used in the world.
 They are active on all life stages of insects and penetrate air spaces where other types of pesticides don't reach.
 Their classification is restricted use due to their acute toxicity (toxicity category I) and the label's signal word is �DANGER.� �DANGER.�
 The phosphorous fumigants are registered for use on food and feed commodities, including grains, animal feeds, coffee, and nuts.
 Aluminum phosphide was first registered in the U.S.
 in 1958 and magnesium phosphide followed in 1979.
 Non-food uses include tobacco and outdoor fumigation for burrowing rodent and mole control.
 They are formulated as several types of solid materials, such as pellets and tablets.
 Upon exposure to heat and moisture, they release their toxic gas.
 At temperatures below 40�F, the gas release is poor and the effectiveness is lost.
 One reason why they have been prominently used is that at normal use rates, they do not affect seed germination.
 Another reason is their ease of application.
 By calculating the volume of space to be fumigated, the directions will state how much material should be placed within the site.
 Phosphine is about 20% heavier than air, thus fans to disperse the gas are unnecessary except in large bulk facilities.
 It takes 3 to 5 days for phosphine fumigation to be complete under warm, humid conditions.
 Aeration can be done in a relatively short time, only 1 to 2 hours.
 Sulfuryl fluoride is a structural fumigant for sites such as dwellings, transport vehicles, rail cars, and ships; it is an odorless gas stored in cylinders under pressure.
 It is not registered for use on food or feed crops.
 It is not effective on insect eggs or at temperatures below 55�F.
 Because sulfuryl fluoride is odorless, a warning agent, such as chloropicrin, can be added to the gas.
 Toxicity Toxicity
 Phosphine gas is extremely irritating to the respiratory tract.
 It also produces severe systemic toxicity.
 Most severe acute exposures have involved ingestion of the solid aluminum phosphide, which converts rapidly to phosphine gas by acid hydrolysis in the stomach.
 Poisoning due to ingestion carries a mortality rate of 50 to 90%.
 Poisonings had become frequent during the late 1980s and early 1990s in some parts of India.
 Symptoms of poisoning include fatigue, nausea, headache, dizziness, thirst, cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and loss of heartbeat in severe cases.
 The common cause of death is by excessive fluid buildup in the lungs.
 Chronic toxicity due to phosphine gas appears to be minor or have a very long latency period.
 The available evidence for reproductive effects in animals suggest that reproductive effects are not likely in humans under normal conditions.
 Animal data also suggest that phosphine would not be likely to cause teratogenic effects in humans.
 No evidence was available regarding the ability of aluminum phosphide or phosphine to cause mutations or increase the mutation rate.
 No data are currently available which evaluate its carcinogenic effects.
 Sulfuryl fluoride exposure has caused some deaths, primarily by individuals entering fumigated structures without respiratory protection.
 Symptoms of poisoning include nose, eye and throat irritation, weakness, nausea, vomiting, cough, restlessness, muscle twitching and seizures.
 Rats, rabbits, guinea pigs and female rhesus monkeys tolerated air concentrations of 100 ppm (417 mg/m3) for 7 hours per day, 5 days a week for 6 months with no apparent adverse effects.
 There have been no reproductive, teratogenic, or mutagenic effects reported from sulfuryl fluoride exposure, and carcinogenicity data do not exist at the time of this publication.
 Mammalian toxicities for the phosphorous and sulfur fumigants are shown in Table 1.
 Table 2 lists the toxicities to wildlife, if known, by the common name of the pesticide.
 Because these fumigants are labeled for indoor use, compliance with label directions will limit exposure to wildlife, thus little data are available.
 Table 3 provides a cross listing of some of the trade names that these products are registered and sold by in Florida.

 Acute Pesticide Poisoning Associated with Use of a Sulfotepp Fumigant in a Greenhouse -- Texas, 1995 1995
 Pesticide fumigants that eradicate pests but do not damage flowers or foliage can be used to protect market-ready florals.
 During November 1995, a pesticide applicator worker in Texas became ill during fumigation despite wearing the personal protective equipment (PPE) recommended on the fumigant product label.
 This report summarizes the results of the case investigation by the Texas Department of Health (TDH) and CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and a survey of growers about pesticide use.
 The findings indicate that the recommended PPE may be inadequate to protect workers using sulfotepp fumigants from pesticide poisoning.
 Case Investigation Investigation
 On November 30, 1995, the Environmental and Occupational Epidemiology Program at TDH was notified by the Texas Poison Center Network of a 32-year-old man who had visited an emergency department (ED) because of symptoms consistent with acute pesticide poisoning, including headache, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, slight dizziness, sweating, fatigue, abdominal pain, anxiety, muscle aches, chest tightness, drowsiness, restlessness, shortness of breath, and excessive salivation.
 The patient was a pesticide applicator employed at a greenhouse and had applied sulfotepp fumigants (Plantfume 103 and Fulex) * the previous night.
 Sulfotepp, a highly toxic organophosphate pesticide and cholinesterase inhibitor, is used in greenhouses to control aphids, spider mites, thrips, and whiteflies; sulfotepp does not damage delicate flowers or foliage (1).
 The patient reported onset of symptoms shortly after igniting the sulfotepp fumigant canisters in the first of four interconnected greenhouses where chrysanthemums, poinsettias, and other plants were grown.
 Despite feeling ill and smelling the chemical, he and three other workers completed fumigating all four greenhouses.
 He did not seek medical care until the following day.
 Physical examination at the ED was unremarkable, and he was released without treatment.
 The patient was a licensed pesticide applicator and had been employed at the greenhouse for 2 years.
 Although he had applied other fumigants in the past, this was the first time he had applied sulfotepp and the first time the chemical was used in this greenhouse.
 During the application, he wore the PPE recommended on the product label, including a laminated full-body suit, rubber boots, nitrile gloves, and a full-face air-purifying respirator equipped with a pesticide prefilter and organic vapor cartridge.
 He had undergone a qualitative (smoke) respirator fit test in November, and no leakage was detected.
 A qualitative fit test conducted after the incident indicated an adequate fit.
 On December 3, TDH and NIOSH interviewed the other applicators, inspected the PPE, and observed the next fumigant application at the greenhouse.
 All three applicators reported wearing the label-recommended equipment, and two of these three workers reported nausea and detecting the odor of the chemical during application on November 30; however, they did not vomit or seek medical care.
 During the second application, unopened canisters of Plantfume 103 and Fulex were set out in a grid-like fashion within each greenhouse.
 In accordance with the label instructions, a total of 80 canisters were set out (one canister per 20,000 cubic feet).
 The internal air circulation system and the exhaust ventilation system were turned off.
 The internal air circulation system had not been turned off during the previous application because the applicators misinterpreted the instructions.
 To avoid the smoke, the workers ignited the canisters as they exited each greenhouse, but each canister rapidly generated smoke.
 After the final canister was ignited, the workers moved to a shipping area not being treated with the fumigant, removed their PPE, and left the facility.
 The time necessary to complete the application was approximately 45 minutes and, even though all product label instructions were followed, the index patient again reported some symptoms.
 Survey of Growers Growers
 During December, TDH conducted a telephone survey of greenhouse operators in Texas to assess the prevalence of greenhouse fumigant use and the occurrence of possibly related adverse health effects among workers.
 TDH contacted 413 Texas companies listed under Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 5193 (nursery stock for florists and the same SIC code as the greenhouse) and identified 53 companies with greenhouses in which plants were grown.
 All 53 companies participated in the survey.
 Of these, 43 (81%) reported ever using fumigants, and 30 (70%) of the 43 reported using sulfotepp.
 Of the 43 companies using any type of fumigant, 33 (77%) reported that workers used respirators during fumigant application, including five that used respirators with an independent supply of compressed air.
 Three (7%) companies reported that at least one worker had become ill during the application of fumigants, none of which contained sulfotepp; none of the workers sought medical care for their illness.
 At two of these three companies, workers wore all label-recommended PPE during the fumigant application; at the third company, workers did not use PPE during the application.

 Editorial Note Note
 Editorial Note:
 Although pesticide use in the United States has doubled since the 1960s (2), the health effects of pesticide use on agricultural workers has not been well documented.
 In Texas, where occupationally related acute pesticide poisoning is a reportable condition, 247 cases were reported during 1986-1994.
 However, during 1989-1990, only 20% of cases were reported (TDH, unpublished data, 1991).
 The findings of the TDH investigation indicate that the acute illness among workers in this report most likely was associated with exposure to the sulfotepp fumigant and underscore the importance of reporting pesticide poisonings.
 Exposure occurred even though the workers followed the pesticide label instructions and properly used all recommended PPE during the second application.
 Because there was no evidence of oral or dermal contact with the chemical and workers smelled the chemical, inhalation was the most likely route of exposure.
 Other factors potentially associated with exposure may have included the technique employed in igniting the canisters and operation of the internal air-circulation system during the first application, which may have increased dispersion of the fumigant throughout the greenhouse.
 The sulfotepp label instructions state that applicators and other handlers must use "a respirator with either an organic vapor-removing cartridge with a prefilter approved for pesticides (approval prefix TC-23C) or a canister approved for pesticides (approval prefix TC-14G)" (3,4).
 In general, such filters do not provide adequate protection against the high ambient chemical concentration and small particle size characteristic of fumigants.
 In addition, a single type of filter may not be appropriate for all types and forms of pesticides and, in July 1995, NIOSH discontinued certifying cartridges specifically for use with pesticides.
 ** The survey findings in this report indicated that many greenhouses use fumigants, most workers use only a respirator, and other greenhouse workers had become ill during fumigant applications, despite the use of label-recommended PPE.
 Neither the product distributor nor the formulators of Plantfume 103 and Fulex had received reports of illness related to these products; however, neither maintained surveillance for potentially related problems or illnesses.
 During 1985-1992, the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) received 23 reports of illness in persons occupationally exposed to sulfotepp (EPA, unpublished data, 1996); 70% of these persons were referred to health-care facilities, and 7% were hospitalized.
 As a result of this investigation, TDH and NIOSH recommended to EPA that sulfotepp fumigant labels be amended to indicate the appropriate respiratory protection.
 Label instructions for other pesticide fumigants also may need to be reviewed for appropriateness.
 In addition, advertising material and labels for pesticide prefilters, cartridges, and canisters should clearly state they are not for use with fumigants.
 Professional associations and licensing and regulatory agencies should provide applicators with educational materials regarding the safe use of pesticide fumigants, including appropriate PPE, efficient fumigant application procedures, and less toxic pest-control options.
 Employers should implement comprehensive PPE programs, including selection of appropriate respirators by qualified staff using NIOSH-recommended procedures (5).
 Introduction Introduction
 In modern terminology a fumigant is a chemical which, at a required temperature and pressure, can exist in the gaseous state in sufficient concentration to be lethal to a given pest organism.
 This definition implies that a fumigant acts as a gas in the strictest sense of the word.
 This definition excludes aerosols, which are particulate suspensions of liquids or solids dispersed in air, and which are popularly referred to as smokes, fogs or mists.
 It is important to make this distinction at the outset because it emphasizes one of the most important and useful properties of fumigants:
 as gases they diffuse as separate molecules.
 This enables them to penetrate into the material being fumigated and to diffuse away afterwards.
 On the other hand, aerosols are unable to penetrate even a short distance into materials because their particles are deposited at the outer surfaces.
 Insecticides, which are sprayed on leaves or other surfaces so that insects coming in contact with them or eating them are poisoned, sometimes exert sufficient vapour pressure to give off gas.
 Under certain circumstances, this gas may account for some of the toxic action - the so-called "fumigation effect".
 This manual will not deal with this subject; the discussion here is confined to fumigants which are dispensed so that the poison is present as gas soon after application and reaches the insect only in this form.
 Present Status of Fumigation Fumigation
 Fumigants are still widely used for the control of insects and other pest organisms.
 Because of their unique characteristics and the great adaptability of the fumigation technique, fumigants can often provide effective, economical control where other forms of pest control are not feasible.
 In many cases treatments can be carried out on infested material without disturbing it in any way.
 The development of lightweight plastic sheets to enclose spaces or materials requiring fumigation has extended the use of fumigants and made control procedures easier and much more adaptable.
 Several modern technological developments, including instrumentation for gas detection and analysis, improved formulations as well as increased demand for effective and economical pest control measures, have done much to improve fumigation procedures.
 Modern technology and research have also brought to light certain problems with fumigants that were previously unknown.
 Numerous investigations made on both the acute and chronic effects of fumigants have shown that some of these materials are capable of producing serious effects on human health.
 In some cases fumigants with excessive hazard potential have been restricted or prohibited so that they are no longer widely used for pest control in some countries.
 In this edition of the manual, all of the fumigants in the previous editions are included and the nature of hazards posed by any material outlined so that the fumigator will be aware of potential problems.
 Fumigant use is, more and more, being determined on a risk-benefit basis, where materials with unusual hazards are used only because no effective substitute is available.
 When such materials are used, the fumigator should take additional precautions to avoid any hazard.
 Misuse or accidents that generate adverse publicity can do much harm to the practice of fumigation and may jeopardize public acceptance of other fumigants not having such effects.
 Great care should be taken to ensure that fumigants are always used wisely and carefully.
 Fumigation Personnel Personnel
 The practice of pest control is becoming increasingly specialized and requires professional personnel who are familiar, not only with the pest and the pesticide, but who also have a good knowledge of the many factors related to pest infestation and control.
 Even in field applications, where much of the work may be done by relatively unskilled people working under a well-trained foreman, a working knowledge of the principles of fumigation can be an asset.
 In addition, reasonable physical fitness, mental alertness and the ability to understand verbal and written instructions and to carry these out carefully are required.
 In this field, physical fitness includes absence of any respiratory trouble which might make the operator unduly susceptible to the effects of gases or protective equipment.
 Personnel assigned to fumigation work should receive thorough instructions on the properties of fumigants and training in safe methods of handling.
 This manual can provide the basis for a suitable course in these aspects of the subject.
 Scope and Use of the Manual Manual
 The manual deals primarily with the use of fumigants as insecticides.
 This aspect in itself is very broad.
 The control of bird and mammalian pests is also mentioned in connexion with certain fumigants.
 There is no discussion of soil fumigation since this is a complete subject in itself.
 Because control of nematodes is mainly an aspect of soil fumigation, the effect of fumigants on this group is not considered fully here.
 It is not possible, or even desirable, to describe here a large number of treatments in great detail.
 Instead, in order to make the manual as widely useful as possible, there will be a discussion of basic principles followed by a description of some of the more general applications which can be adapted to deal with specific problems.
 Emphasis will be placed on those techniques which can be readily employed without the use of elaborate equipment.
 Expensive equipment, where it exists, is operated by personnel already thoroughly trained in the work.
 Some recommendations for actual treatments will be given in the various schedules, but these will be representative rather than comprehensive.
 However, known exceptions and pitfalls will be stressed wherever applicable.
 To avoid needless repetition, an attempt has been made to mention most subjects only once.
 The information required to carry out a certain technique may, therefore, have to be obtained from different chapters.
 For instance, if a certain fumigant is to be used in a certain type of application described in one chapter, it is essential that the section in Chapter 6 dealing with that fumigant be read to obtain additional information which may be applicable.
 Also, the section in Chapter 3 on precautions must be regularly consulted until a certain procedure is completely mastered.

 Fumigation and pest management programmes programmes
 Fumigation is just one of a number of methods that can be used for controlling pests in stored products.
 The best control is likely to be obtained when all appropriate measures are taken to eliminate pest organisms.
 In an effective pest management programme, methods of prevention and control are integrated to give maximum protection of goods at the lowest possible cost.
 Other ways that have been found effective in preventing and controlling infestations are as follows:
 1.
 Sanitation.
 2.
 Exclusion of pests.
 3.
 Low temperature - "freeze-outs", refrigeration, aeration.
 4.
 High temperature - heating of mills.
 5.
 Moisture control - grain drying.
 6.
 Aeration - cooling, drying, elimination of temperature gradients.
 7.
 Protectants - chemicals, inert dusts, natural compounds.
 8.
 Residual or contact insecticides.
 9.
 Atmospheric gases - carbon dioxide, nitrogen.
 10.
 Gamma radiation, radio and sonic waves, microwaves, infra-red radiation.
 11.
 Pheromones.
 12.
 Insect growth regulators.
 13.
 Insect pathogens.
 14.
 Predators.
 15.
 Insect resistant packaging.
 16.
 Resistant varieties.
 An effective integrated pest management system should begin with comprehensive planning to include all aspects of the problem, followed by the application of preventive and control methods.
 For example, the planning of pest management for a commodity like farm stored grain may be divided into five major categories:
 - exclusion of the pest organism; organism;
 - inspection procedures; procedures;
 - good housekeeping and sanitation; sanitation;
 - physical and mechanical control; control;
 - chemical control control
 Infestation problems can often be reduced by careful planning so that the possibilities of pest organisms reaching the commodity will be kept to a minimum.
 Location of the storage relative to sources of infestation is important, as well as quality of the structure.
 Well-built storages, with a minimum of sites where debris can accumulate and insects develop, are desirable.
 Other features of the storage that should be considered include facilities for conditioning such as aeration systems or driers, provision for proper inspection and cleaning and appropriate facilities for pest control procedures.
 Preventive and control methods may include the following:
 1.
 Use of sound structures for storage of commodities.
 2.
 Maintaining clean conditions around storages.
 3.
 Removal of residues of grain or other material from the storage facility four to six weeks prior to storing newly harvested produce.
 4.
 Spraying of storage with approved residual insecticide after removal of food residues.
 5.
 Storage of commodity in a condition suitable for optimum storage, e.g.
 grain is best stored at low moisture levels.
 6.
 Treatment with appropriate insecticide protect ant at the time of storage may be desirable.
 7.
 Use of aeration or other procedures to cool grain and maintain uniform temperature below those favourable for insect development.
 8.
 Regular inspection to determine determine
 (a) evidence of insect activity activity
 (b) accumulation of moisture moisture
 (c) changes in temperature temperature
 9.
 If insects are detected, grain should be fumigated; where field infestation occurs grain should be fumigated within six weeks after harvest.
 Fumigants are a unique and particularly valuable group of pesticides that can kill insects where no other form of control is feasible.
 To a large extent they are irreplaceable.
 The use of certain fumigants has been restricted in some countries because of suspected adverse effects.
 Excessive use of fumigants or the misuse of them to cause accidents and produce adverse publicity is likely to bring about even greater restrictions in their use.
 By careful planning and management, fumigation may be incorporated into food preservation systems so that fumigants can be used more effectively and safely than when used independently.
 They should never be used as a substitute for sound management and good sanitation procedures.
 The benefits derived can include reduced cost of storage with improved food quality, reduced residues in food materials, greater occupational safety and less environmental contamination.
 All of these benefits are of great concern to the general public and will be factors that have to be taken into consideration in the future use of fumigants.
 The ultimate goal in the control of pests in stored products should be to so improve the methods of handling, storing and processing commodities, that the need for pesticides will decrease.
 Fumigants will then only be needed when unavoidable infestations are encountered.

 Principles of fumigation fumigation
 Choice of fumigant fumigant
 There are many chemical compounds which are volatile at ordinary temperatures and sufficiently toxic to fall within the defintion of fumigants.
 In actual practice, however, most gases have been eliminated owing to unfavourable properties, the most important being chemical instability and destructive effects on materials.
 Damage to materials may take place in several ways, as follows:
 1.
 Excessively corrosive compounds attack shipping containers or spoil the structure and fittings of fumigation chambers or other spaces undergoing treatment.
 2.
 Reactive chemicals form irreversible compounds, which remain as undesirable residues in products.
 In foodstuffs such reactions may lead to taint or the formation of poisonous residues.
 Other materials may be rendered unfit by visible staining or by the production of unpleasant odours.
 3.
 Physiologically active compounds may destroy or severely injure growing plants, fruit or vegetables, and may adversely affect seed germination.
 Highly flammable compounds are not necessarily excluded if dangers of fire and explosion can be controlled by the addition of other suitable compounds, or if fumigation procedures are carefully designed to eliminate these hazards.
 Toxicity to human beings is not necessarily a cause for exclusion.
 All known fumigants are toxic to humans to a greater or lesser degree and ways can be devised for their safe handling under the required conditions of application.
 However, some commonly used compounds have been shown to be capable of producing long-term effects that were previously unknown.
 The use of such fumigants is becoming more restricted and some materials have already been eliminated from the list of fumigants approved for use in certain countries.
 Table 1 lists a number of common insecticidal fumigants which have been used for many years.
 Although some of these fumigants may no longer be extensively used they have been included here and in other parts of the manual so that adverse effects as well as useful properties can be indicated.
 The final selection of a fumigant for any particular pest control problem will be influenced by the various properties of the compound along with the type of pest organism and the nature of the commodity (Heuser, 1975).
 As the number of chemicals approved for use as fumigants is small, and is declining, this selection is being narrowed to a very few.
 Pesticide Illness Illness
 Part 3:
 Fumigants, Fungicides, Herbicides, Disinfectants, Miscellaneous Pesticides Pesticides
 Slide 1 1
 This section continues the discussion of different types of pesticides.
 Please refer to the speaker�s notes to supplement the PowerPoint slides.
 Slide 2 2
 In Part 3, fumigants, fungicides, herbicides, disinfectants, and miscellaneous pesticides will be discussed.
 The fumigants will be discussed first.
 Slide 3 3
 Fumigants are comprised of a various toxic chemical classes with the common feature of being gasses at room temperature.
 Four categories are listed on this slide.
 The halogenated hydrocarbons include methyl bromide, which will be discussed in this presentation.
 Metal-phosphide compounds are toxic through the generation of phosphine.
 They are used for rodent control and on agricultural commodities.
 Pro-fumigants such as metam sodium are not gaseous themselves but break down into other fumigants.
 Finally, sulfuryl fluoride is an example of an inorganic compound used as a structural fumigant.
 As a class, fumigants have a capacity for diffusion across various surfaces, a property essential to their function.
 They readily penetrate rubber and neoprene protective equipment, as well as human skin.
 They are readily absorbed across the pulmonary membrane, gut, and skin.
 Special adsorbents are required in respiratory canisters to protect exposed workers from airborne fumigants.
 Even with the use of these adsorbents, complete protection may not be provided.
 Slide 4 4
 Methyl bromide is commonly used to sterilize soil prior to planting, to control pests on commodities during storage, and as a structural fumigant (especially termite control in buildings).
 Methyl bromide has a high vapor pressure, which means it is very volatile.
 When used to sterilize soil, it is injected into the soil and the area is immediately covered with a tarp that controls the rate of volatilization from the soil.
 Because it is a heavy gas, it tends to accumulate in low pockets� depressions in the ground or lower levels of buildings.
 Because it is highly toxic but lacks warning properties such as odor or irritation, chloropicrin (or tear gas) is required to be added to methyl bromide as a warning agent.
 Methyl bromide exerts its toxic effects by methylation of tissues.
 Slide 5 5
 Methyl bromide is a vesicant and causes severe skin blistering on direct contact or exposure to very high air levels.
 The photo on the right shows a case of blistering dermatitis of the foot associated with application of methyl bromide.
 Most fumigant dermatitis cases involve the feet, as shown in the photo on the top right.
 The photo on the bottom right shows blistering dermatitis in the axillary area of fumigations workers who wore respiratory protection but no dermal protection inside a fumigated structure structure
 Methyl bromide may cause delayed effects on the lower respiratory tract.
 Inhalation exposure may result in pulmonary edema, with delayed onset 4-12 hours after exposure.
 For suspected inhalation exposure to methyl bromide, patients should be hospitalized overnight for observation.
 Because of its poor water solubility, methyl bromide does not cause upper airway irritation.
 However, upper airway irritant effects may result from exposure to chloropicrin.
 Symptoms and signs of central nervous system depression due to methyl bromide range from headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, to tremors, weakness, diminished reflexes, and seizures.
 CNS depression is the most common cause of death following acute methyl bromide exposure.

 Slide 6 6
 The differential diagnosis of methyl bromide toxicity may include other causes of CNS depression, such as solvents and drug overdose, stroke, or infectious agents.
 Noncardiogenic causes of pulmonary edema, such as hepatic or renal disease or acute, severe asthma, may need to be considered if the exposure history of the patient is unknown.
 Slide 7 7
 Management of methyl bromide poisoning is primarily supportive.
 Blood bromide levels may be obtained to confirm suspected exposure to methyl bromide.
 Bromide levels are indicators of exposure, not disease severity.
 Based on published case reports, levels may be roughly correlated with categories of clinical outcomes.
 3-6 ppm:
 Exposure may have occurred at this lower limit, but no symptoms are expected expected
 >15 ppm:
 Symptoms of acute poisoning may be observed above this level level
 >50 ppm:
 Severe symptoms or death may be observed above this level.
 50ppm is the lowest serum bromide level associated with death.
 In some European countries, bromide levels may be used for biologic monitoring of manufacturing workers.
 Note that bromide levels may be reported in a variety of units, as indicated in the table at the right.
 The detection of serum bromide does not itself indicate that exposure has occurred to methyl bromide.
 Some foods, especially seafood, and certain medications contain inorganic bromide and consumption may result in asymptomatic elevation of bromide levels.
 Bromide levels gradually return to normal, the duration determined by the peak level and acuity of exposure.
 As with most other pesticides, treatment is supportive and based on clinical suspicion, not laboratory results.
 For example, breathing support should be provided in instances of respiratory failure; anticonvulsants are indicated for seizures.

 There are few well-controlled studies of the effects of chronic, low-level methyl bromide toxicity.
 However, case reports have documented cognitive dysfunction, behavioral changes, and progressive ascending sensory polyneuropathy.
 Methyl bromide is a methylating agent, a weak mutagen, and possible animal carcinogen.
 It is teratogenic in animal studies.
 Induction of DNA damage has not been documented among methyl bromide applicators.

 Slide 9 9
 Serum bromide levels may not be useful in the evaluation of chronic exposure, as they correlate poorly with toxic effects in these cases.
 The serum half-life is 11-15 days, so bromide may be detected 1-2 weeks after exposure has ceased.
 In cases of chronic exposure, levels of 50-100 ppm may be observed without signs or symptoms of toxicity.
 Recently, special testing has shown that protein adducts formed after exposure to methyl bromide may be a better measure of significant exposure.
 Adducts have been used to confirm acute methyl bromide toxicity 10 weeks after an exposure.
 Their use in assessment of chronic exposure has not been tested.
 The photo at right shows a residence next to a tarped field where methyl bromide was applied.

 A woman lived in a spare room adjacent to a guest house treated for termites because of a pending sale.
 She was in her room the evening the adjacent structure was fumigated.
 The next day, she was in the house intermittently, but retired early in the evening because of flu-like symptoms.
 Slide 11 11
 The guest house had been fumigated with methyl bromide.
 The pesticide applicator, homeowner, and resident of the guest house were unaware of an uncovered electrical conduit passing between the two buildings.
 Slide 12 12
 The homeowner brought a prospective client to the guest house the following evening and found her tenant convulsing on the floor.
 The tenant�s initial serum bromide level was 270 ppm ppm
 The tenant never recovered consciousness and died 19 days later from refractory seizures, intermittent fever, and multi-organ failure.

 Slide 13 13
 Because methyl bromide depletes the protective layer of ozone, a gradual phase-out of production has been scheduled, with complete cessation of production to be completed by 2005.
 At this time, it does not seem that the reduction will truly cease, since there will be exemptions for certain uses.
 These include �critical agricultural uses� (agricultural uses for which no feasible alternative is available), pre-shipment and quarantine uses, and �emergency uses�.
 Furthermore, although there are a few alternatives to certain uses of methyl bromide, users of the pesticide feel that an ideal substitute has yet to be developed.
 Some proposed alternatives to methyl bromide include sulfuryl fluoride and metam sodium.
 While methyl bromide may be used for both agricultural and structural applications, sulfuryl fluoride is used only for structural applications and metam sodium for agricultural ones.
 Slide 14 14
 Sulfuryl fluoride is the principal alternative to methyl bromide for structural fumigation.
 It is not an option for pre-plant fumigation.
 In part because it has not been used extensively until recently, human toxicity information on sulfuryl fluoride is inadequate.
 Like methyl bromide, sulfuryl fluoride lacks warning properties and exerts pulmonary and CNS toxicity.
 Chloropicrin is added as a warning agent to sulfuryl fluoride applications.
 Signs of exposure may include dyspnea and cough.
 Delayed pulmonary edema may occur and exposure may warrant hospitalization for monitoring.
 Fatal hypoxia has been reported following early re-entry into treated structures.
 Renal injury with proteinuria and azotemia has been reported.
 Signs and symptoms of CNS toxicity include weakness, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, muscle twitching, and seizures.
 Although it is not known to cause ozone depletion and the available literature suggests that it is not as toxic as methyl bromide, it is not an ideal substitute because of its toxic properties.
 Slide 15 15
 Metam sodium is used as a pre-plant soil fumigant and is an alternative to methyl bromide.
 As use of methyl bromide in agricultural applications has been decreasing, metam sodium use has risen.
 Metam sodium is not an ideal substitute for methyl bromide because it is not useful for structural fumigations and is not non-toxic.
 Metam sodium is a pro-fumigant.
 That is, it is not itself a gas at room temperature, but hydrolyzes to form a mixture of irritant gasses:
 Hydrogen sulfide, carbon disulfide, methylamine, methyl isothiocyanate (MITC) and methyl isocyanate (MIC).
 MITC is the primary irritant gas formed by hydrolysis of metam sodium.
 Although the most irritating of the gasses formed is MIC, the gas released in the 1984 accident in Bhopal, India, it is formed in small quantities and is unlikely to be the major irritant released by metam sodium hydrolysis.
 Health effects due to MITC and the other irritant gasses consist of irritant dermatitis and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome or exacerbation of pre-existing asthma.
 Slide 16 16
 The following case illustrates health effects caused by an accidental spill of metam sodium.
 A 40 year-old male transportation worker was evaluated by his primary care physician for acute onset of metallic taste, detecting an unusual odor, burning eyes, chest and nose, nausea, and dizziness.
 He was off work for the next 5 days due to recurrent cough with wheezing and phlegm.
 After returning to work, he noted cough on exposure to diesel exhaust (to which he was exposed in his line of work), chest tightness and dyspnea on exertion.
 He smoked 1.5 packs per day for 7 years.
 Prior to this episode, he was in good health, without a history of bronchitis or asthma.
 Reference:
 Cone J, et al.
 Persistent respiratory health effects after a metam sodium pesticide spill.
 Chest.
 1994; 106:500-508.
 Slide 17 17
 The worker relayed the following occupational exposure history:
 Prior to developing symptoms, he was called to aide in the response to a train derailment.
 Several tank cars had fallen into the river in a rural area, releasing more than 19,000 gallons of the pesticide metam sodium.
 The worker began work alongside the derailment.
 His symptoms began 20 minutes after beginning work.
 He worked for 6.5 hours alongside the river.
 He denied direct contact with the spilled pesticide or the river water.
 Slide 18 18
 The spilled metam sodium traveled down the river over several hours, resulting in the off-gassing of irritant compounds along the entire river.
 The transportation worker was one of many workers responding to the spill and residents along the river with persistent respiratory effects.
 The photo to the right shows the effects of the spilled metam sodium on the aquatic life all along the river.
 The metam spill killed fish along the 40 mile length of the river over 3 days.
 Because of continuing symptoms, the worker was referred for evaluation at a university occupational medicine clinic.
 Exam 6 months following the spill showed mild nasal inflammation; his lungs were clear and the chest X-ray was normal.
 Spirometry results were consistent with mild airways obstruction:
 FEV1:87% predicted, FVC:101% predicted; ratio of FEV1 to FVC:
 69% FEF25-75:
 26% predicted.
 Methacholine challenge test performed 9 months after the spill showed airway irritability (airway responsiveness increased by 100% at a lower dose of methacholine than in normal individuals).
 The medical and exposure history suggest that his symptoms were consistent with non-specific airway hyperresponsiveness caused by inhalation exposure to the irritant gases produced by hydrolysis of metam sodium.
 Slide 19 19
 Long-term low-level exposure to both methyl bromide and sulfuryl fluoride has been reported to cause chronic neurologic deficits.
 The literature includes both case reports and studies evaluating neuropsychological tests among chronically exposed workers.
 Methyl bromide is a well-known animal reproductive toxin.
 As illustrated by the case of the transportation worker, airway irritability may persist for months after even brief exposure to metam sodium, resulting in reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) or asthma.
 Metam sodium has been shown to be a reproductive toxin in animal feeding studies studies
 Methyl isothiocyanate (MITC) studies show have shown no chronic effects, but several studies allege chronic health effects of caused by one of the byproducts of metam sodium, methyl isocyanate (MIC), following the 1984 release of MIC in Bhopal, India.
 Health effects commonly found in these studies include chronic inflammatory ocular conditions, adverse reproductive outcomes (spontaneous abortions), and chronic pulmonary conditions, primarily fibrosing bronchiolitis obliterans.
 Slide 20 20
 In this next case, metam sodium exposure resulted from drift following an agricultural application.
 As shown in the photo to the right, metam sodium was applied by sprinkler to carrot fields.
 Illnesses were reported among children at a neighboring school, resulting in school evacuation.
 Illnesses were also reported among several groups of workers:
 employees at the school that was evacuated and other non-agricultural workers up to 1 mile from the pesticide application site.
 The most common symptoms reported among workers were teary and irritated eyes, headache, nausea, cough, and upper respiratory pain and irritation.
 Slide 21 21
 There were two important findings from the investigation of this incident:
 1.
 MITC was detected at the school, beyond the 500 ft.
 �buffer zone�.
 A buffer zone is the area between the edge of the application site �sensitive receptors� or areas where individuals at risk for pesticide illness may be located.
 Sensitive receptors may be schools, hospitals, etc.
 2.
 The applicators were required to monitor the field for MITC odor.
 If odor was detected, the workers were to apply additional water by sprinkler to slow rate of volatilization.
 This practice was specified on the pesticide label and was intended to minimize MITC exposure to the community.
 Based on these findings, recommendations were made to:
 �	Increase the buffer zone to 1 mile for 72 hours for sprinkler applications of MITC to minimize exposure (This type of change in regulation may occur at the county level.).
 �	Cease the practice of using odor as a field monitoring practice.
 Because the label specifies that workers must conduct odor monitoring, this type of recommendation is a lengthy process that involves working with US EPA as well as state agencies.
 Slide 22 22
 The next category of fumigants we will discuss are the phosphide compounds.
 Metal phosphides such as aluminum, zinc, magnesium phosphides hydrolyze to produce the toxic gas phosphine.
 Phosphine is colorless, and has a characteristic odor described as fishy or garlicky.
 It is highly explosive and corrosive.
 Sweat, oil from skin can initiate breakdown of phosphine tablets, shown in the photo.
 Phosphine readily oxidizes in the body, ultimately to phosphoric acid.
 No diagnostic tests are available for phosphine exposure due to its rapid oxidization.
 Slide 23 23
 Illness due to low level exposure to phosphine may resemble common viral illnesses, with symptoms of dizziness, headache, cough, and airway irritation.
 More severe exposures may result in dyspnea, delayed pulmonary edema, and CNS toxicity, which may manifest as staggering gait, tremor, diplopia, and hallucinations.
 Ingestion results in multi-system failure with cardiac toxicity (arrhythmias, S-T segment changes, heart block, pericarditis), renal failure, adrenal injury, and liver necrosis .
 Slide 24 24
 An unemployed male stowed away in a railcar traveling between Texas and California.
 The railcar was fumigated with aluminum phosphide in transit.
 His badly decomposed body was found on arrival in California.
 Death was most likely due to pulmonary and CNS toxicity.
 Phosphine is highly corrosive and hastens tissue decomposition.

 Mehler L, et al.

 MMWR.
 1994; 43:489-91.
 Slide 25 25
 The next category that will be presented are the fungicides, an important and widely used group of pesticides.
 There are several different types of fungicides.
 The thiocarbamate group includes zineb, maneb, ziram, and thiram.
 The pthalimide derivative captan will be discussed.
 Chlorothalonil, and hexachlorobenzene are substituted aromatic compounds.
 Sulfur is a commonly used inorganic fungicide, and is allowed in organic as well as conventional agriculture.
 Slide 26 26
 Fungicides are well-known to cause both acute and chronic dermatologic effects.
 Chronic exposure may be carcinogenic.
 Slide 27 27
 The thiocarbamate fungicides chemically resemble the rubber accelerator thiuram, a common sensitizer in standard skin patch test series.
 Sensitization has been reported in workers exposed to thiocarbamates through treated seeds, application on golf courses, and handling ornamental flowers with residues.
 Important members of this group shown on the right include manganese and zinc bis-dithiocarbamates (zineb and maneb).
 Slide 28 28
 In addition to skin irritation, antabuse-like reactions may be observed with the thiocarbamate thiram and the rubber accelerator thiuram.
 Workers may experience severe flushing reactions with headache, nausea and vomiting if alcohol is ingested shortly after exposure.
 This reaction resembles �degreaser�s flush� associated with tetrachlorethylene.
 Slide 29 29
 In a crew of 30 people picking Bosc pears, 26 complained of skin rashes on their arms, hands, faces and abdomens.
 Physical exams were consistent with contact dermatitis dermatitis
 Five days before picking, the following were applied aerially:
 -NAA 800, a growth regulator used to prevent premature fruit drop drop
 -Ziram Granuflo, a fungicide fungicide
 Slide 30 30
 As specified by label requirements, the workers did not reenter the field until the pesticide had dried (specific number of days or hours were not specified).
 Ziram applications had been made to D'Anjou pears and Golden Delicious apples as well as to Bosc pears.
 However, only workers picking Bosc pears had symptoms.
 The mechanism of dermatitis was postulated :
 -Sharp latent buds form on Bosc pears.
 -Skin abrasions during picking may have formed as a result of these buds and increased the workers� susceptibility to dermal irritation.
 Slide 31 31
 Data received from the manufacturer of ziram indicated that the half-life of this fungicide on pears is 9 days.
 Although geographic and weather conditions affect the half-life of pesticides, no information was available on the variability of ziram�s half-life.
 The re-entry interval (REI) is the time between pesticide application and the time when workers are allowed to enter the treated field.
 The REI was increased to 14 days in the state where this incident occurred, based on the half-life of ziram in the field on the reported human exposure incident described in this case.
 Slide 32 32
 Like the thiocarbamates, the pthalimide derivative, captan causes skin irritation.
 Dermatitis associated with spraying captan on apples is a relatively frequently reported problem in some states.
 Human Draize (irritation) tests on human volunteers show that 5% of those tested are sensitized to captan.
 Slide 33 33
 A worker in a redwood nursery complained of itching and hives at work.
 Patch testing with chlorothalonil (used in the nursery) provoked local Type I allergic reaction (immediate hypersensitivity with dermal erythema, inflammation).
 Open test with 1% chlorothalonil provoked a systemic Type I reaction (wheezing).

 Slide 34 34
 This photo shows a banana plantation worker with blue-gray pigmentation in the antecubital area.
 Patch testing with chlorothalonil resulted in a positive skin reaction.
 The diagnosis is ashy dermatitis, an unusual pigmentary reaction to chlorothalonil.

 Slide 35 35
 Chlorothalonil disrupts the basal membrane of the epidermis.
 Histological examination reveals melanin deposits in dermis.
 Clinically, this manifests as ashy dermatitis.
 Slide 36 36
 Sulfur is a widely used fungicide, especially on grapes (both table and wine grapes).
 It is one of the few pesticides used in organic farming.
 Large number of cases suggest that elemental sulfur is a potent skin irritant.
 However, animal experiments on sulfur-induced skin irritation are equivocal.
 Conflicting results may be due to differing product compositions and experimental conditions.
 There are sporadic reports of upper airway irritation or exacerbation of pre-existing asthma following exposure to elemental sulfur used as a pesticide.
 However, the literature fails to support sulfur as an airway irritant.
 Some of the variability in sulfur-induced skin and airway irritation may be explained by environmental oxidation/reduction of sulfur.
 Oxidation products of sulfur such as sulfites, sulfuric acid, and hydrogen sulfide are well-documented airway irritants.
 Slide 37 37
 A pesticide applicator developed a rash on his arms while dusting roses with sulfur.
 The applicator complained of burning.
 The pattern of lesions corresponded to places where dust settled on sweaty skin, and was consistent with contact dermatitis due to sulfur.
 Reference:
 O�Malley M.

 Slide 38 38
 Workers with a history of sulfur application in nurseries show positive patch test reactions to sulfur.
 This is the most frequent single allergic reaction to pesticides.
 There are only occasional literature reports describing allergic reactions to sulfur.
 However sulfur-induced allergy is supported by reported cases of contact allergy and IgE sensitivity to sulfites.
 Slide 39 39
 Oxidation or reduction products of sulfur, such as sulfites or sulfuric acid, hydrogen sulfide may be the cause of allergic reactions.
 The exact mix of products is determined by pH, temperature, and ionic strength of the product.
 Contact dermatitis caused by sulfur is consistent with a Type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction.
 Slide 40 40
 Herbicides are commonly used around the world.
 Important herbicides include the dipyridyls:
 paraquat and diquat, glyphosate, and the phenoxy compounds 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D.
 Slide 41 41
 Both paraquat and diquat are nonselective contact herbicides that can exert similar significant systemic toxicity.
 Although it is a restricted pesticide in the US and banned in several Western European countries, paraquat is widely used, primarily in developing countries, primarily because it is labor-saving, cheap, and readily available.
 Because of their similar toxicities, only paraquat will be discussed.
 The photo at right shows a banana plantation worker in South America.
 Sweat and oil from the skin can initiate breakdown of phosphine tablets.
 Paraquat is commonly used in banana agriculture.

 Slide 42 42
 Paraquat is extremely toxic via ingestion, with effects on multiple organs.
 The LD50, or 50% lethal dose, is 3-5 mg/kg or 10-15 ml of a 20% solution.
 Because of its toxicity, green coloring is added as warning property to paraquat solutions.
 Toxicity is primarily directed at the skin and lungs.
 It has also been alleged that there is a risk for Parkinson�s disease following exposure, although the evidence is equivocal.
 Slide 43 43
 Dermal contact with paraquat may result in blisters, ulcers, and fissured skin.
 The photo on the left shows bullous contact lesions in an exposed patient.
 Based on undetectable blood levels of paraquat at the time photographs were taken, systemic absorption did not occur.
 Nail damage and loss is a significant feature of paraquat dermal toxicity, as seen in the photo at right.
 Ocular exposure may result in corneal opacification opacification
 Inhalation exposure may cause nose and throat irritation, including nosebleeds.

 Slide 44 44
 Paraquat is most toxic following ingestion.
 GI irritation with edema and ulcers begin 1-4 days following ingestion.
 This is followed by hepatic and renal injury.
 Pulmonary fibrosis manifests last, 72-96 hours after ingestion, but is usually the cause of death.
 (In slide show mode, press space bar) bar)
 The diagram at right shows the mechanism of paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
 Paraquat, or PQ on the diagram, is actively taken up by pulmonary alveolar eptithelial cells, where enzymatic reduction and reaction with oxygen yields the di-cation PQ2+ and a highly reactive superoxide radical (O2-).
 Superoxide and its detoxification products damage the lipid membranes of cellular components and the cell dies.
 Contributing to cell death are the cell�s attempts to detoxify paraquat, which depletes NADPH, and results in disruption of important biochemical processes.
 Slide 45 45
 As with other pesticides, the clinician should look for clues in the history that suggest that paraquat exposure has occurred.
 Exposure to a green liquid is one such clue.
 If exposure is suspected, paraquat levels of the pesticide in body fluids should be obtained to confirm exposure.
 Blood or urine paraquat levels most likely underestimate the dose absorbed following ingestion exposure, but they may predict survival.
 Gastric contents may also be assayed for paraquat, but there is no clinical correlation.
 Based on human case series, blood and urine levels may be roughly correlated with outcome:
 Survival is likely if urine levels within the first 24 hours are less than 1 mg/mL and plasma levels are < 20 mg/kg.
 Gastrointestinal effects are likely even at these levels.
 At higher levels, both urine and plasma concentrations can be used to predict either pulmonary fibrosis with delayed death or death within 24 hours due to multi-organ failure.
 However, urine levels associated with these outcomes vary widely.
 Nomograms are often used to predict the prognosis in cases of ingestion exposure.

 Slide 46 46
 Decontamination of dermal and eye exposures by removal of clothing and thorough lavage with soap and water or eye irritation is essential to minimize direct toxicity and absorption.
 Treatment for paraquat poisoning will be most effective if administered within 2 hours of ingestion.
 Beyond this time, plasma concentrations may increase rapidly by several orders of magnitude.
 If ingestion is suspected, further absorption should be prevented by immediately decontaminating the GI tract with Fuller�s Earth and Bentonite, which bind paraquat well.
 If they are not available, activated charcoal may be administered.
 Gastric lavage is contraindicated if more than 1 hour has elapsed since ingestion, because of the risk of exacerbating mucosal damage.
 Gastric contents (and contaminated clothing) may be assayed for paraquat.
 Because oxygen increases the availability of superoxide radicals, oxygen administration is contraindicated except to relieve air hunger in severe hypoxemia.
 Although fluid administration, hemodialysis, and hemoperfusion have been recommended to eliminate paraquat, they have not been shown to improve survival.
 They may, however, be used to treat resulting renal insufficiency.
 High dose steroids and cyclophosphamide may improve the survival of severe cases.

 Slide 47 47
 In a suicide attempt, a 46 year old male farmer intentionally ingested a greenish liquid stored on his farm an hour before seeking medical attention.
 He had not eaten since the evening before.
 In the emergency room, he complained of dysphagia and sore throat.
 Past medical history was significant for a depression and a previous suicide attempt.
 Paraquat ingestion was suspected, based on the color of the liquid.
 In the hospital, profuse, prolonged vomiting was observed.
 He was initially treated with oral Fuller�s Earth and mannitol, and IV hydration.
 The plasma paraquat level 4 hours after ingestion was 3 mg/mL.
 24 hours after ingestion, the serum creatinine was twice normal.
 Slide 48 48
 On day 2, the farmer complained of severe dysphagia; his abdomen was distended and decreased bowel sounds were present.
 On day 3, he complained of shortness of breath; crackles were audible at the left base and air entry was decreased at the right base.
 The chest X-ray showed right basilar atelectasis.
 Over the next 5 days, renal and pulmonary function continued to deteriorate.
 The chest X-ray, shown on the slide, revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates, most marked in the perihilar regions.
 The pO2 on room air was 33 mm Hg.
 Although his renal function improved, the farmer died on day 12 due to extensive proliferative pulmonary fibrosis.
 Factors that contributed to fatal outcome in this patient include:
 Ingesting paraquat on an empty stomach, which most likely contributed to a rapid rise in plasma levels.
 Relatively high plasma level of paraquat at 24 hours (based on a commonly used nomogram, a plasma level of 3 mg/mL 4 hours after ingestion is associated with a 75% chance of dying) dying)
 Slide 49 49
 The next herbicide we will discuss is glyphosate.
 While it is not as systemically toxic as paraquat, it is widely used as an herbicide by both professional applicators and home-users, resulting in large numbers of potentially exposed persons.
 There are case reports of eye and skin irritation following exposure to glyphosate.
 The skin effects are often described as an erythematous, pruritic rash.
 However, experimental studies fail to show skin irritation.
 Animal studies show respiratory tract irritation following intra-tracheal instillation.
 Ingestion of large amounts of glyphosate has been used successfully to commit suicide.
 Health effects observed include mucosal and gastrointestinal irritation, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, respiratory failure, and renal insufficiency.
 The mechanism of human toxicity is unknown.
 The surfactant, an isothiazoline preservative, may contribute to the irritant effects.
 Slide 50 50
 Chlorophenoxy herbicides are sometimes mixed into fertilizers for control of broadleaf weeds.
 Several hundred products contain chlorophenoxy herbicides in various forms and concentrations.
 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D are two herbicides that belong to this class.
 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) is manufactured by hydroxylation of tetrachlorobenzene.
 2,4,5-T was used as Agent Orange during the Vietnam War.
 It is best known for its dioxin contaminants, the byproducts of an exothermic manufacturing process.
 This herbicide is no longer produced in the US.
 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is manufactured by the chlorination of phenol, and does not contain dioxin contaminants.
 Slide 51 51
 Chlorophenoxy herbicides are moderately irritating to skin and mucous membranes.
 Inhalation may result in cough and burning sensations in the nasopharynx and chest.
 Information on systemic toxicity derives from cases of deliberate suicidal ingestion, mostly involving 2,4-D.
 At high doses, CNS findings predominate, with symptoms including stiffness of arms and legs, incoordination, lethargy, anorexia, stupor, and coma.
 Patients present with vomiting, diarrhea, headache, confusion, and bizarre behavior that may be rapidly followed by progression to coma.
 Renal failure with metabolic acidosis and multi-organ failure may follow.
 Muscle weakness may persist for months after acute poisoning.
 Muscle weakness and peripheral neuropathy have also been observed following occupational exposure.
 Chronic oral exposure to 2,4-D results in anemia, decreased liver enzyme activity, and increased kidney weight have been observed in animals.
 Several human studies have suggested an association between exposure to 2,4-D (and other herbicides) and an increased incidence of tumor formation.
 However, it is not clear whether this represents a true association, and, if so, whether it is specifically related to 2,4-D.
 Some studies have reported increased incidences of tumors in orally exposed animals.
 EPA has not classified 2,4-D as to its human carcinogenicity.
 Dioxin contaminants produced during the production of 2,4,5-T have been associated with chloracne.
 However, the pesticide itself is not associated with this condition.

 Slide 52 52
 As mentioned in the first part of this curriculum, US EPA considers antimicrobials and disinfectants pesticides as they are used to kill pests.
 These compounds are used in a wide variety of workplaces as well as homes.
 Commonly used disinfectants are sodium hypochlorite, or bleach, isopropyl alcohol, gluteraldehyde, and formaldehyde.
 (Formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature and is considered a fumigant.) The aldehydes are primarily respiratory irritants and sensitizers.
 Hypochlorite by itself is a skin irritant and causes burns of the GI mucosa if ingested.
 (In slide show mode, press space bar or next slide) slide)
 However, inappropriate mixtures of hypochlorite with acids or ammonia produce chlorine gas and chloramines and are responsible for large numbers of illnesses in a variety of occupational settings as well as homes.
 Slide 53 53
 Chlorine-containing antimicrobials are often mixed with acids or ammonia in an attempt to improve cleansing ability.
 The resulting products, chlorine gas and chloramines, are acute respiratory irritants that may result in acute bronchitis and exacerbation of existing asthma.
 Persistent effects of acute exposure include chronic bronchitis and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS).
 Treatment is supportive:
 oxygen and bronchodilators.
 Prophylactic antibiotics and systemic steroids have not been shown to improve the prognosis.
 Slide 54 54
 A 29 year-old custodian is seen in the emergency room with a cough, sore throat and extreme shortness of breath.
 At work, he mixed ammonia and bleach to clean a particularly stubborn stain in a bathroom.
 He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes a day.
 On exam, he is coughing, dyspneic, and tachypneic, with respiratory rate of 36; Lungs reveal scattered rales and wheezes; oxygen saturation is 94% on room air, 96% on 5L O2 O2
 The peak expiratory flow rate is 80%, lower than expected for a young, healthy worker.
 The custodian�s diagnosis is acute bronchitis with bronchospasm.
 He should be treated with supplemental oxygen, Atrovent and Albuterol.
 He will need follow up to monitor for RADS and bronchitis.
 Incidentally, this worker was driven to the ER by a coworker who brought the empty but open bottles containing the bleach and ammonia with him in the car.
 He complained of a sore throat.
 Exam revealed mild pharyngeal erythema.
 Upper airway irritation resulted from exposure to hypochlorite fumes.
 He was treated with throat lozenges.
 Slide 55 55
 Dermatologic effects predominate the health effects of pesticides.
 Two miscellaneous pesticides with skin effects are briefly presented, propargite, an acaricide, and DEET, an insect repellant.
 Slide 56 56
 Although there are no reports of systemic toxicity, propargite causes severe skin irritation.
 The photo at right shows scarring as a result of severe dermatitis in citrus harvesters despite use of long sleeves.
 These workers were exposed to high levels (0.89-5.49 �g/cm2) of a prolonged release formulation of propargite that persisted beyond the restricted entry interval.

 Saunders DL, et al.

 Slide 57 57
 DEET is a widely used insect repellant that is sometimes applied directly to the skin.
 It is severely irritating in high concentrations (>30%).
 The photo at right shows blistering (an irritant reaction) due to the concentrated DEET used by the military (US, Israeli).
 Consumer use formulations, typically in concentrations under 30% DEET, may result in contact urticaria.
 Central nervous system effects, such as seizures and encephalopathy are rare.
 They are more likely in children under the age of 5, and when high doses or concentrated formulations are used.
 For this reason, if DEET must be used, it is advisable to apply DEET to clothing instead of directly to the skin, particularly in children and when open sores or other dermatologic conditions are present.

 Because the acute toxicity of a wide variety of pesticides were described in this curriculum, only the general principles will be summarized here.
 While pesticides can affect any organ system, the most commonly affected are the skin, lungs, and central nervous system.
 The severity and target organ of pesticide-related health effects varies by type of pesticide, dose, and route of exposure.
 Geographically, the most severe health effects occur in developing nations because of the cheap and ready availability of extremely toxic pesticides and the lax enforcement of any laws that may exist.
 Pesticide-related health effects occur as a result of use at the workplace or at home, but may also be due to drift or other secondary exposure.
 Prevention of pesticide related illness is multifactorial, and includes surveillance and investigation of illness, enforcement of existing laws, strengthening of ineffective laws, and substituting toxic pesticides with less toxic substances.
 Ethylene dibromide, and DBCP (dibromochloropropene) are fumigants that were used in the past to sterilize soil prior to planting.
 Both these fumigants are now banned in the US because they are male reproductive toxins.
 These 2 fumigants are mentioned for historical purposes but will not be further discussed in the section on fumigants.
 Fumigants Fumigants
 Frequently linked with accidental mass poisonings, fumigants are inherently dangerous pesticides.
 Even when accidents do not occur, fumigant application exposes people to unsafe levels of these toxic compounds.
 Highly volatile, fumigants are used to sterilize soil before planting crops such as strawberries, potatoes and carrots.
 They are applied intensively � 50-400 pounds per acre compared to 1�5 pounds per acre for other pesticides.

 Health Effects & Toxicity Toxicity
 Fumigant pesticides also are among the most toxic chemicals used in agriculture.
 The U.S.
 EPA categorizes most fumigants as "highly acutely toxic" � the agency's most extreme toxicity category.
 Major Soil Fumigants Fumigants
 Chloropicrin was originally used in chemical warfare during WWI.
 After the war, chloropicrin's poison gas effects proved useful against soil pests, and chloropicrin remains in wide use as a soil fumigant today.
 Metam sodium and its main breakdown product have been implicated in a number of pesticide poisonings.
 Another of its breakdown products, methyl isocyanate, is the same chemical responsible for the 1984 tragedy in Bhopal, India.
 Methyl bromide, a potent neurotoxin also known for its ozone depleting potential, has largely been phased from agricultural use.
 Methyl iodide, the proposed replacement for methyl bromide, is in fact more toxic than its predecessor.
 Acute fumigant poisoning causes eye irritation, sore throat, headaches, nausea, vomiting, breathing difficulties and aggravated asthma, and neurological effects such as convulsions, dizziness, or tremors.
 Fumigant exposure.
 Cancer:
 Several fumigants are known carcinogens, including methyl iodide, 1,3-Dichloropropene, and metam sodium; all of which are included in California's Proposition 65 carcinogen list.
 Respitory damage:
 Exposure to fumigants can cause perminant respitory damage.
 In lab animals chronically exposed to chloropicrin, researchers observed permanent damage to the bronchial tree, as well as lung cancer and tumors.
 (See:
 CDPR Assessment) The CDC classifies chloropicrin as a "lung damaging agent," noting that poisoning can cause a lethal pulmunary edema.
 Neurological Effects:
 Methyl bromide and methyl iodide are both potent neurotoxins.
 Exposure to methyl bromide adversely affects cognitive function, physical coordination and muscular control (Extension Toxicology Network) Network)
 Reproductive & developmental effects:
 Some fumigants are linked to elevated risk of miscarriage.
 In animal studies, fetal survival rate was significantly reduced from methyl iodide exposure.
 (See:
 CDPR Assessment) Assessment)
 Immune system effects:
 Research shows that exposure to metam sodium and its breakdown product, methyl isothiocyanate, can weaken the human immune system.
 Endocrine Disruption:
 Fumigants are known to interfere hormones.
 In labratory studies the fumigant metam sodium supressed hormones that control ovulation and also increased stress hormones.
 Methyl iodide disrupts thyroid hormones critical for fetal development, resulting in increased miscarriage and developmental delays research shows.
 Poisonings & Drift Drift
 The volatility of fumigants makes them inherently dangerous.
 Communities and farmworkers near agricultural fields face serious risks of acute pesticide poisoning from drifting fumigants.
 Fumigant drift has also been measured in air far from application sites, sometimes at levels above those considered �acceptable� for longer-term seasonal exposures by EPA or the California Department of Pesticide Regulation.
 (See:
 Second-hand Pesticides:
 Airborne Pesticide Drift in California) Results from PANNA's Drift Catcher project in Sisquic, California showed that residents were exposed to levels of chloropicrin that exceeded California's acute level of conern for children.

 Fumigants & the Environment Environment
 Fumigants dramatically impact soil health and sustainability---eradicating not only weeds and pests, but also beneficial organisms.
 Several studies cited in the Journal of Pesticide Reform indicate that fumigants can devastate beneficial nematodes, fungi, and bacteria critical to the nitrogen cycle.
 Sustainable Alternatives Alternatives
 Economically viable non-chemical alternatives are available and already in use by organic and other sustainable agricultural practitioners.
 These alternatives include use of resistant cultivars, cultural methods such as crop rotation and use of cover crops as well as physical methods such as soil solarization (download PANNA's Technical Comment letter for more detail on alternatives).
 Initial situation situation
 In China tea has been known as a special remedy for 2,700 years.
 The tea developed into a popular drink and in the 19th century it also reached Europe and America.
 Apart from Japan and China, Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka) and India became the most significant tea producers due to the plantation style cultivation of tea.
 Green tea is primarily produced in China and Japan.
 The leaves of the tea bush, Camellia sinensis L.O.
 Kunze are only subjected to hot air drying.
 When producing black tea on the other hand the tea leaves are subjected to various processes such as withering, rolling and fermentation.
 During fermentation the typical flavours and ingredients are formed.
 Tea growing in monoculture farming requires intensive fertilisation and the use of plant protection and pest control agents.
 Partly, persistent organochlorine pesticides are still used (e.g.
 DDT).
 Also the use of preservatives (e.g.
 fumigants) for the storage of tea, cannot be ruled out.
 The tea plant can assimilate radionuclides from the soil.
 The radioactive fallout coming from the reactor fire in Chernobyl, descended on Turkey among other places, a country that also has tea plantations.

 European countries such as Germany or Great Britain can be declared as the country of origin if the tea is processed in these countries.
 However the raw materials come from the Far East.
 Test method method
 Gamma spectrometry spectrometry
 The tea samples are counted in calibrated sample vessels with well defined geometry and density with a gamma spectrometer.
 The nuclides 224Ra, 228Th and 226Ra can be indirectly determined after equilibration via their appropriate daughter nuclides 212Pb/212Bi and 214Pb/214Bi.
 228Ra is in equilibrium with its daughter nuclide 228Ac and can therefore be put in equilibrium with the activity of 228Ac.
 Fumigant Fumigant
 Sulfuryl fluoride, methyl bromide and phosphine are determined directly in the tea sample with headspace gas chromatography and mass specific detection.
 Additionally the test for the use of the fumigant methyl bromide occurs by determining its metabolite bromide.
 For this purpose, the samples are activated with neutrons.
 The radioactive bromide is finally determined with gamma spectrometry (neutron activation analysis).
 By using this procedure, a treatment with methyl bromide can be proven, even if the active ingredient has disintegrated in the meantime.
 Results Results
 Radioactivity Radioactivity
 In 13 out of 40 samples no radioactive Caesium was traceable.
 In 25 samples residues of 0.2 to 2 Bq/kg of 137Cs were found.
 In contrast black tea from Turkey attracted our attention:
 two black tea samples contained 61 � 4 and 100 � 7 Bq/kg of the radionuclide 137Cs and had to be objected to (tolerance value:
 10 Bq/kg).
 All tea samples showed residues of natural radionuclides.
 Due to the relatively high potassium content in the tea plant the naturally radioactive potassium (40K) is present in the tea with increased activity (320 to 700 Bq/kg).
 40K has a relatively constant activity in the body and is homeostatically regulated.
 The dose caused by 40K is relatively constant and is estimated to be 0.17 to 2.1 mSv/a.
 Tea consumption only makes a negligible contribution (approx.
 5 �Sv/a) to this.
 Further natural radionuclides apart from potassium could be found in practically all teas.
 The total limit value of 50 Bq/kg for the natural radionuclide group 2 was exhausted at up to 35% in the maximum case.
 The measured activities come mainly from the two radium nuclides 226Ra and 228Ra.
 The total limit value for group 1 (500 Bq/kg) was exhausted at 5% in the highest case.
 In five tea samples traces of methyl bromide could be found (0.2 � 0.3 �g/kg).
 In three samples the values were significantly above the basic level, between 1.4 and 1.8 �g/kg.
 An organically grown mate green tea showed residues of a treatment with the fumigant methyl bromide (1.4 �g/kg) and had to be objected to.
 The finding was corroborated by proof of an increased bromide content in the tea due to the treatment (56 mg Br/kg).
 An oriental black tea was equally proven to have been treated with methyl bromide (1.5 �g/kg methyl bromide and an increased bromide content of 21 mg Br/kg).
 However the tolerance values were not exceeded.
 The fumigants sulfuryl fluoride and phosphine were not found in any of the tea samples.
 Either they were not used in the tea or the tea was efficiently ventilated.
 Fumigation continues to play a valuable role in many pest control operations; however both the concepts and procedures for controlling insects and other organisms are changing.
 Fumigants have unique properties and capabilities that permit use in numerous situations where other forms of control are not feasible or practical.
 A practical example is a warehouse.
 Fumigation and pest management takes care of insects and pests infestation and fumigants exist in gaseous and has sufficient concentration on intended insects and pests.
 The chemical insecticides and pesticides are made to penetrate into material and areas being fumigated and diffuse afterward, hence making your home or office congenial.
 The adaptability of fumigation technique, fumigants can often provide effective economical control where other forms of pest control are not feasible.
 Our brands of chemicals are mixed in the right quantities and applied accordingly reflecting the needs of the individual or corporate entity.
 There are some insecticides and pesticides that offer protection over nine months after its use.
 We take care of insects and pests like lice, bees, mosquitoes, houseflies, termites, cockroaches, ants, wall geckoes, lizards, spiders, wasps, crickets, bed bugs and many more.
 Rats and other poisonous animals like snakes, scorpions and frogs are also taken care of.
 We also offer advice on hygiene, sanitation conditions, environmental protection and its sustainability.
 The causes of infestations and breeding grounds are permanently destroyed.
 We blend fumigation and preventive advice for our clientele since fumigation is not a total solution without best practice of preventive measures.
 Other ways that have been found effective in preventing and controlling infestations are as follows:
 1.
 Sanitation.
 2.
 Exclusion of pests.
 3.
 Low temperature - "freeze-outs", refrigeration, aeration.
 4.
 High temperature - heating of mills.

 FAQ FAQ
 NITROGEN NITROGEN
 What is it?
 What are the chemical characteristics of nitrogen?
 Nitrogen is a gas that is extremely important to living creatures, such as plants, animals and human beings, which depend on this gas for their survival.
 The earth�s atmosphere is the greatest source of nitrogen.
 About 78% of the air we breathe consists of this inert gas.
 Nitrogen has no smell and no colour, and is not toxic.
 Large quantities of nitrogen are found in humus and in organic matter in soil.
 Nitrogen exists in the earth�s atmosphere in the form of diatomic molecules comprising two nitrogen atoms.
 Among other uses, nitrogen is used to create anoxic (oxygen-free) atmospheres to preserve materials and to eliminate insect pests.
 Liquid nitrogen is used in freezing food and in many instruments.
 FUMIGATION FUMIGATION
 What is it?
 What hazards are linked to fumigation?
 Fumigation is a traditional method, now falling into disuse, that consists of disinfesting documents and other objects using chemical agents or pesticides.
 Fumigants are among the most toxic pesticides.
 Ethylene oxide was used as a fumigant in archives and libraries up to the 1980s, using special fumigation chambers.
 This pesticide is effective against insects in any stage of development, from eggs to adults.
 It is, however, very dangerous to workers and users at these institutions.
 It reacts with some matters and can even alter the physical and chemical properties of paper and some types of binding leathers.
 Levels of tolerance to the use of this pesticide have been progressively lowered by the authorities, rendering installed fumigation chambers obsolete.
 One of the specialised services provided by EXPM Lda is the conversion of chambers of this type into anoxic chambers.
 Residues of ethylene oxide tend to remain in disinfested objects and documents during long periods, with concentration levels that can constitute a permanent human health hazard.
 In general, fumigants and other pesticides can cause serious damage to health , particularly nausea, respiratory problems and cancer.
 Many chemical treatments may be apparently inoffensive during exposure, but the consequences of this exposure may appear years later in the health of those people coming into contact with these agents.
 Generally speaking, treatment with chemical pesticides does not prevent reappearance of the pests.
 Knowledge of the risks associated with this method of disinfestation led to the search for and research and development of non-chemical methods of pest control.
 CONVERSION / UPGRADE OF TOXIC DISINFESTATION CHAMBERS CHAMBERS
 Can traditional pesticide-based disinfestation chambers be converted?
 Yes, our history of anoxic treatment includes the conversion of the disinfestation chambers of the Torre do Tombo National Archives and of the National Library that used to work with toxic gases.
 ANOXIA ANOXIA
 What is it?
 What does anoxic disinfestation consist of?
 Anoxic disinfestation is a process whereby the combat against infestation by insects (one of the main causes of destruction of documents and works of art) is undertaken by asphyxia, through the use of completely innocuous gases such as nitrogen, argon or carbon dioxide.
 The process is simple and is not toxic.
 It is based on the removal of atmospheric air and its replacement with nitrogen, argon or carbon dioxide.
 This method can be employed in a disinfestation chamber (an air-tight steel chamber in which the objects are placed) or in a bubble of plastic film wrapping the object (the process is extremely flexible and can be used with every kind of object, big or small).
 This technique requires isolation of the documents and objects to be treated:
 the atmosphere inside is modified and several parameters are controlled, such as:
 oxygen/ carbon dioxide content, temperature, gas pressure and moisture).
 Anoxic disinfestation chamber and anoxic bubble:
 owing to the nature of the biological cycles of the insects that attack the material of books and other substances found in the collections of libraries and in archives, the disinfestation operations have to be co-ordinated with the customer to determine the type of infestation of the documents.
 Safety:
 the collections of museums, libraries and archives may be threatened by several pests, constituting a serious threat to their preservation.
 The method of pest control least prejudicial to the collections and to the personnel is carried out by means of modifying the atmosphere, an alternative to chemical control.
 Anoxic disinfestation is a method that has no noxious effect on the items that are treated or on the operator.
 It is safe, ecological, non-toxic, non-flammable and non-chemical.
 It consists of wrapping the item to be treated in a special film and removing the oxygen inside.
 The oxygen is replaced by an inert gas, thus eradicating all insects no matter what their stage of development (egg, lava, pupa, adult, etc.).
 This process is monitored by state-of-the-art equipment of extreme sensitivity and precision.
 It does not modify the physical or chemical properties of the item treated, and its original form is retained, though freeing it from the action of the pests.
 EXPM ANOXIC BUBBLE BUBBLE
 CONSTRUCTION CONDITIONS CONDITIONS
 Are there any specifications for the place where the treatment is to be carried out?
 We prefer a space that is easy to heat, with a not very high ceiling and a size suited to the size of the bubble to be built.
 EFFECTIVENESS WARRANTY WARRANTY
 Does your work provide any guarantee as to the treatment?
 Yes.
 To guarantee 100% effectiveness of the pests we have to work with very low O2 contents (under 3000 ppm) and a temperature over 22� C.
 The time in the bubble should be greater than 30 days.
 INERT GASES USED USED
 Since you mention different gases that can be used in the process, I would like to know exactly which gas you intend to use in our case:
 We want to disinfest about 26 m3 of wooden moulds?
 We can use any inert gas.
 However, given the characteristics of the material to be treated we would prefer to use carbon dioxide.
 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SPACE SPACE
 Technical requirements of the compartment necessary to install both the chamber and all the monitoring equipment:
 are air inlets and/or outlets needed?
 Yes.
 An exhaust point is needed for the chamber, a gas exhaust to the outside (50 mm), either direct or piped.
 LOADING THE CHAMBER CHAMBER
 What care should be taken when placing material in the chamber?
 As an optional accessory, the chamber can be provided with a stacking trolley that allows the material to be stacked and introduced into the chamber safely and easily.
 ACCESSORIES ACCESSORIES
 What is understood by documentation stacking and handling ?
 Construction solutions and accessories that optimise the use of the chamber chamber
 SUPPORT TRAINING TRAINING
 What type of training is provided for the EXPM chamber operator?
 Training in use of the chamber is directed at its operator � all mechanical procedures are utomated.
 Orders for the chamber are fulfilled complete with all support required to train the personnel operating the chamber, including the presence of and EXPM technician, to clear up any doubts arising during the opening and closing of the chamber.
 CAPACITY CAPACITY
 How many books can the EXPM6 chamber take?
 You suggest 100 to 120 lm (linear metres), which means a conversion of 1 m3 to 20 lm, which seems exaggerated, particularly since the books should not be placed close together, preventing the �movement/flow of air� or the penetration of the new atmosphere.
 The quantity of the documents depends on their volume, and the conversion is therefore approximate, calculated in accordance with the average found for other chambers in use.
 The use of the chamber with medium- and low-pressure cycles is designed, among other things, to force the penetration of the anoxic atmosphere into every document to be treated, even in those parts more inaccessible under normal atmospheric conditions.
 TEMPERATURE CONTROL CONTROL
 Are temperature control mechanisms required in the compartment where the chamber and the monitoring systems are located?
 The EXPM6 chamber has an optional accessory to control and maintain adequate temperature parameters.
 DURATION OF TREATMENT TREATMENT
 How many days does treatment last?
 The literature suggests 3 or 4 days to achieve ideal conditions and treatment of 30 days or more.
 Anoxic treatment using the EXPM6 chamber is effectively complete in 1 to 3 weeks.
 PARAMETER STABILISATION STABILISATION
 How long does it take to achieve ideal environmental conditions inside the chamber for the treatment?
 Use of nitrogen bottles allows optimal anoxic treatment parameters to be reached in 2 to 5 hours.
 QUARANTEE OF EFFECTIVENESS EFFECTIVENESS
 How can effectiveness of the treatment be attested?
 Current practice is to systematically monitor the document archives using insect traps (information available on the site) so as to determine the existence and/or continuation of pests.
 NITROGEN GENERATORS VS.
 NITROGEN BOTTLES BOTTLES
 What problems do you consider to be inherent in nitrogen generating equipment?
 The option for nitrogen bottles in conjunction with the use of pressure and low-pressure cycles allows every part of the documents to be reached, even if there are bubbles of oxygen inside the documents, and the stabilisation of the internal atmosphere at the optimal parameters for treatment within a very short space of time.
 Our knowledge of nitrogen generators shows that the equipment is more expensive (as a result of the greater nitrogen consumption), they provide relatively low flows of nitrogen, increasing the waiting time until the proper parameters are reached.
 Another disadvantage is that we are tied to the nitrogen atmosphere and cannot opt, in some treatments, to use carbon dioxide, which is seen to be more effective in certain cases.
 The nitrogen generator has the advantage of being a complete system, with no need for the additional supply of gas.
 Should you be interested, we are in a position to offer a nitrogen generator, as additional equipment, to feed the chamber (this equipment can event be fitted at any time in the future).
 COMPATIBLE MATERIALS MATERIALS
 What types of documentation and articles (objects) can be submitted to this treatment?
 Non-toxic treatment is effective in all matter that constitutes insect food since no chemical reaction is associated with the treatment.
 We have records of successful treatment on paper, leather, wood and textiles.
 CHAMBER OPERATOR OPERATOR
 What knowledge or specific vocational training should the person have who is to receive training in the operation of the EXPM6 chamber?
 There are no specific requirements for an EXPM chamber operator.
 Its use is intuitive and is simplified by the automation that is provided.
 PROCEDURES INVOLVING DOCUMENTS DOCUMENTS
 What care or procedures should be employed with the documents before and after the treatment?
 Anoxic treatment is curative and not preventive.
 Therefore, disinfested documents should not be put in direct contact with any infested documents.
 However, we do recommend prevention in terms of the development of fungi and bacteria (mould and similar things) by means of sterilising the atmosphere of the archives, treatment of the archive�s furniture and systematic hygiene routines for the documents (we have several technical solutions in this field).
 SPACE REQUIREMENTS / CONTROL EQUIPMENT EQUIPMENT
 Do the chamber and the control equipment have to be located in separate compartments or can they be in just one?
 They can be located in a single compartment.
 AMBIENT TEMPERATURE REQUIREMENTS REQUIREMENTS
 What is the ideal temperature for the room where the chamber and monitoring equipment are located?
 The determinant temperature is the temperature inside the chamber.
 DURABILITY DURABILITY
 What is the life expectancy of the chamber?
 The EXPM chamber is an industrial category item of equipment and is therefore of long duration (provided it is properly maintained).
 SAFETY IN THE SURROUNDING SPACE SPACE
 If the chamber and the process variables are pre-programmed and there is an oxygen analyser, why is there an optional lack-of-oxygen detector ?
 The lack of oxygen detector is an optional accessory designed to monitor the space where the chamber is located (to complement the safety of the inert gas exhaustion system in the event of a defect).
 The programmed parameters refer to the inside the chamber.
 SELF-ADJUSTMENT SYSTEM SYSTEM
 After reaching the ideal atmosphere (temperature, relative humidity and oxygen content) inside The chamber is nitrogen introduced again only if a shortage is detected?
 Or when the monitoring system detects an alteration of the figures?
 The EXPM6 chamber processor controls, records and automatically maintains the optimal parameters for effective treatment.
 PREVENTIVE CONSERVATION CONSERVATION
 PRESERVATION PRESERVATION
 What is meant by preservation?
 (definition adapted from "A Preventive Conservation Programme"; a paper by Dr Luisa Cabral, National Library, presented in Lagoa, Algarve on 3/10/2003).
 "Preservation comprises a number of management measures designed to neutralise potential deterioration of documents" (IFLA).
 It consists of a policy and strategic measures employed in the management of archives and libraries, the principal aim of which is to avoid the deterioration of the collection as a whole.
 This field complements the general maintenance of the buildings, involving co-ordination with other departments.
 In conservation strategy control of the environmental conditions is of particular importance.
 The main factors to consider are:
 Temperature and Relative Humidity, Lighting and Air.
 Quality Quality
 1) Temperature and Relative Humidity Humidity
 a) Effects:
 heat accelerates the deterioration of documents, high relative humidity causes oxidation and, when combined with high temperature, leads to the appearance of mould and insects.
 Low relative humidity makes paper fragile; fragile;
 b) Ideal values:
 temperature should lie between 18 and 20� C and relative humidity between 45% and 55%; 55%;
 c) Control Mechanisms:
 adequate control equipment:
 air-conditioning, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air purifiers; constant monitoring:
 thermographs and computerised system; building maintenance.
 2) Lighting Lighting
 a) Effects:
 light accelerates the deterioration of paper, and weakens and yellows or darkens paper.
 UV rays are particularly harmful owing to photochemical deterioration (high level of energy absorbed by the molecules of the object).
 Damage is cumulative and irreversible; irreversible;
 b) Ideal values:
 the maximum light level should not exceed 50 lux/hour; lux/hour;
 c) Control Mechanisms:
 use of UV filters or optic fibre and of low UV ray emission tungsten lamps is recommended.
 3) Air quality quality
 Effects:
 acidification and discolouration of paper and leather by action of gases and particles such as nitrogen dioxide, sulphuric anhydride, peroxides and ozone.
 Particles, of silica in particular, are abrasive.
 CONSERVATION CONSERVATION
 What is understood by conservation?
 (definition adapted from "Pest Control and Collection Hygiene"; a paper by Dr Katia Bettencourt, National Library, presented in Lagoa, Algarve on 3/10/2003).
 "Conservation is the set of measures directed at systematic, direct intervention in respect of the documents to prevent their deterioration, without altering the physical characteristics of the support " (in IFLA).
 It consists of specialised technical measures designed to correct the physical deterioration of the materials, involving no internal intervention in the work.
 It includes tasks and procedures that include environmental control, pest control and collection hygiene, cleaning, storage, packing, maintenance, measures to prevent, monitor and identify pests and their activity, how to act in the event of infestation, book binding and support transfer, among others.
 It requires assignment of specialised human resources, specialised outsourcing, basic equipment and adequate raw materials.
 CLEANING:
 Cleaning is an elementary, priority and time-consuming task since, to be effective, it has to be systematic and permanent.
 What's it for?
 Proper cleaning prolongs the life of a document, avoiding contact with dust, which, in addition to being abrasive, causes the appearance of mould and attracts insects.
 How is it done?
 Observance of cleaning rules is intended to safeguard the integrity of fragile paper or bindings.
 In cleaning, the following should be taken into account:
 - the physical condition of the documents; documents;
 - the type of dirt; the extent of the job; job;
 - and the value of the works.
 The area of the archives should be vacuumed regularly and water should not be used.
 When being cleaned the documents should be closed and cleaning should begin with the dirtiest part, removing items such as clips, elastic bands, bookmarks, photos, pieces of paper, etc.
 Necessary equipment:
 cleaning must be carried out dfry using dusters, soft brushes, bio-alcohol based detergents (with no ammonia or chlorine); the use of gloves and masks, regulatable-suction vacuum cleaners and cleaning tables with suction is recommended.
 INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT
 What is understood by integrated pest management?
 Integrated pest management consists of a number of safe practices and procedures to prevent infestation by insects, rodents and birds, as part of the pest control programme, which is included in archive, library and museum management.
 The main goal of this programme is the definition of infestation risk prevention strategies.
 What�s it for?
 The aim is to avoid the need for the traditional corrective measures in which detection of pests involves discovery of evidence of their direct action on the documents, objects and spaces of the archive, a dangerous phase in which we can consider the occurrence to be a serious infestation.
 Implementation:
 Integrated pest management is implemented in three distinct stages:
 - control of the environment; environment;
 - monitoring; monitoring;
 - and regular, systematic non-toxic treatment.
 The main advantages of its implementation are safety for the workers and for those using the documents and progressive reduction of costs through the widespread adoption of preventive measures.
 About 3% of insects that are identified constitute a threat to the collections of archives, libraries and museums, since the organic matter that constitutes paper, parchment, textiles, leather, etc., is food for these pests.
 The pest control programme is intended to reduce the risk of infestation by acting in an integrated manner in every aspect linked to the presence of pests, particularly environmental conditions, upkeep of spaces and equipment, and cleanliness, allowing the reality of existing collections to be monitored.
 The pest control programme involves the following stages:
 - preventive measures:
 prevent pests from entering; entering;
 - Identifying pest and their activities; activities;
 - monitoring; monitoring;
 - and how to act in the event of infestation.
 PREVENTIVE MEASURES MEASURES
 1) Prevent pests from entering the building; building;
 2) Eliminate the sources of pest development:
 a) Food:
 remove organic waste daily, avoid eating at the place of work and in areas where the collections are kept.
 Cleaning methods:
 vacuum cleaner and bio-alcohol based detergents; detergents;
 b) Temperature and Relative Humidity:
 Keep the values low:
 Temperature between 18� and 20� C; Relative Humidity between 40% and 55%; 55%;
 c) Habitat:
 control places of little human activity, chimneys and fireplaces, air, ventilation and heating ducts, cracks and cavities in walls and floors, basements, accumulation of waste matter (cardboard boxes, furniture, etc.).
 3) Quarantine:
 Inspect objects, isolate objects, keep records of the state of repair, carry out treatments.
 The Inspection Area should have its own isolated room allowing:
 1.Inspection of documents and transport containers; containers;
 2.Isolation of material in duly-identified bags; bags;
 3.If no activity is encountered, isolate the material and wait for spring or summer; summer;
 4.If activity is detected, carry out disinfestation � residual pesticides should not be used; used;
 5.In the cleaning area, after disinfestation use a suction table, brushes and personal protection equipment (gloves and mask as protection against the activities of micro-organisms responsible for respiratory and skin allergies; and and
 6.In the packing area, following disinfestation, the packing should be done using boxes of the correct size and the transport should be undertaken using special trolleys for the purpose.
 IDENTIFY PESTS AND THEIR ACTIVITY ACTIVITY
 Insects:
 the larvae cause most damage; the adult insect is easier to detect; casual visitors; cockroaches that prefer food; flies that leave droppings, etc.
 Deteriorated matter:
 includes wood, plywood with glue, cellulose-based composite materials, books, wool, feathers, hides, textiles, animal and vegetable adhesives, stick-on labels, etc.
 MONITORING MONITORING
 Pest detection means include:
 - regular, periodic inspection of the building; building;
 - control of environmental conditions; conditions;
 - and setting out insect traps.
 Insect traps have a non-toxic adhesive and allow detection of the presence of insects but do not fight the infestation.
 Having been set out in strategic places they must be inspected periodically.
 When the traps lose their adhesive and are very dirty they should be replaced (in the latter case, the traps also detect dirt).
 - Use of traps to monitor insects involves determining the risk zones, determining material that can attract the insects and calculating the number of traps in accordance with the area; area;
 - The traps should be identified, placed on the floor or on the shelves and the environmental conditions of these places should be determined (temperature and relative humidity) by means of a digital apparatus or portable thermograph; thermograph;
 - The traps and their locations should be inspected 2 to 4 times a year; year;
 - The location of each trap , which has its own identification sheet, should be marked on a copy of the plan of the building.
 Each trap�s identity sheet should record:
 - environmental conditions; conditions;
 - amount and type of insects; date; date;
 - season of the year; year;
 - and the technician in charge.
 Proper control of pest monitoring allows reports and comparative charts to be drawn up, and also the detection of the presence of organisms of other types.
 HOW TO ACT IN THE EVENT OF INFESTATION INFESTATION
 Procedures Procedures
 - isolate the infested material; material;
 - clean the surroundings; surroundings;
 - collect samples of the insects and/or traces of their activity, record temperature and relative humidity; humidity;
 - contact colleagues or institutions experienced in infestations and contact a company specialised in disinfestation (EXPM, Lda).
 Disinfestation Methods Methods
 - residual insecticides (desiccants, capsules, suspension, gel); gel);
 - traps containing raticide; raticide;
 - low and high temperature conditioning; conditioning;
 - modified atmospheres:
 inert gas systems � nitrogen or argon or carbon dioxide; dioxide;
 - chemical compounds:
 methyl bromides and ethylene oxide; very toxic for users, have a cumulative effect, reduce the ozone layer in the atmosphere, leave residues on the objects, which are released over time (during years) and contaminate the atmosphere; atmosphere;
 - and natural repellents.

 Overview Overview
 EPA is requiring important new safety measures for soil fumigant pesticides to increase protections for agricultural workers and bystanders � people who live, work, or otherwise spend time near fields that are fumigated.
 These measures are for the soil fumigants:
 chloropicrin chloropicrin
 dazomet dazomet
 metam sodium/potassium sodium/potassium
 methyl bromide bromide
 Soil fumigants are pesticides that, when applied to soil, form a gas to control pests that live in the soil and can disrupt plant growth and crop production.
 Soil fumigants are used on many high value crops and provide benefits to growers in controlling a wide range of pests, including nematodes, fungi, bacteria, insects and weeds.
 As gases, however, fumigants move from the soil to the air at the application site and may move off site at concentrations that produce adverse health effects in humans from hours to days after application.
 These health effects range from mild and reversible eye irritation to more severe and irreversible effects, depending on the fumigant and the level of exposure.

 Risk Mitigation Measures for Soil Fumigants:
 EPA is requiring a suite of complementary mitigation measures to protect handlers, reentry workers, and bystanders from risks resulting from exposure to the soil fumigant pesticides.
 These measures are designed to work together to address all risks, but focus on the acute human inhalation risks that have been identified in the revised risk assessments for these fumigants.
 Most of the measures summarized here apply to all of the soil fumigants (for example, fumigant management plans).
 See fact sheets explaining implementation of these general risk mitigation measures.
 However, some measures are specific to individual fumigants (for example, buffer distances).
 The fumigant-specific measures are explained in detail in chemical-specific Amended REDs.
 Measures include:
 Buffer zones (see related fact sheet) sheet)
 Posting requirements (see related fact sheet) sheet)
 Agricultural worker protections (see related fact sheet) sheet)
 Applicator training programs and safety information for handlers (see related brochures) brochures)
 Good agricultural practices practices
 Application method, practice, and rate restrictions restrictions
 Restricted use pesticide classification classification
 Site-specific fumigant management plans (see related fact sheet; templates) templates)
 Emergency preparedness and response requirements (see related fact sheet) sheet)
 Compliance assistance and assurance measures measures
 Community outreach and education programs programs
 Buffer Zones:
 (Fact Sheet) EPA is requiring fumigant users to establish a buffer zone around treated fields to reduce risks to bystanders.
 A buffer zone provides distance between the application site (i.e., edge of field) and bystanders, allowing airborne residues to disperse before reaching the bystanders.
 This buffer will reduce the chances that air concentrations where bystanders are located will cause adverse health effects.
 EPA has selected buffer distances that will protect bystanders from exposures that could cause adverse effects, but that are not so great as to eliminate benefits of soil fumigant use.
 The size of the buffer zones is based on the following factors:
 application rate; rate;
 field size; size;
 application equipment and methods; and, and,
 emission-control measures (e.g., tarps).
 Buffer zone distances will be provided in look-up tables on product labels.
 EPA is also giving "credits" to encourage users to employ practices that reduce emissions (for example, use of high-barrier tarps).
 Credits will reduce buffer distances.
 Some credits will also be available for site conditions that reduce emissions (e.g., high organic or clay content of soils).
 Posting Requirements:
 (Fact Sheet) For buffer zones to be effective, bystanders need to be informed about their location to ensure they do not enter areas designated as part of the buffer zone.
 EPA is requiring that buffer zones be posted at usual points of entry and along likely routes of approach to the buffer unless a physical barrier prevents access to the buffer.
 The signs must include a �do not walk� symbol, fumigant product name, and contact information for the fumigator.
 Agricultural Worker Protections:
 (Fact Sheet) Persons engaged in any of a number of activities that are part of the fumigation process are considered �handlers.� Handler activities include operating fumigation equipment, assisting in the application of the fumigant, monitoring fumigant air concentrations, and installing, repairing, perforating, and removing tarps.
 Respiratory Protection:
 Many current labels require handlers to use respirators when air concentrations in the area where they are working reach certain action levels, but do not require monitoring to determine if the action levels have been reached.
 New labels will require handlers to either stop work or put on respirators if they experience sensory irritation.
 In most cases inhalation risks can be mitigated with the use of air purifying respirators if they choose to continue working after experiencing sensory irritation.
 For scenarios involving very high air concentrations where these respirators do not provide adequate protection, EPA is requiring handlers to stop work and leave the area.
 If there is an emergency involving applications of methyl bromide or chloropicrin, then a self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) may be required.
 Additionally, EPA is requiring that handlers be:
 fit-tested to ensure respirators will provide the protection they are designed to provide; provide;
 trained in how to properly use a respirator; and and
 determined to be healthy enough to wear the respirator to ensure they have no problems such as a heart condition that could make use of the respirator dangerous.
 Tarp Perforation and Removal:
 Fumigant gases become trapped under tarps and can be released when the tarp is perforated (i.e., cut, punched, poked) and removed (for application methods in which tarps are removed before planting).
 Handlers perforating and removing tarps within 14 days of the application may be exposed to air concentrations of concern.
 To reduce these exposures, the Agency is requiring the following:
 a minimum interval of 5 days between application and tarp perforation; perforation;
 a minimum interval of 2 hours between perforation and tarp removal; removal;
 that handlers stop work or use of respiratory protection if irritation is detected; and, and,
 use of mechanical devices (e.g., using all-terrain vehicles with cutting implements attached) with few exceptions.
 Entry-Restricted Period:
 Stakeholder comments indicate that reentry for non-handler tasks is generally not needed for several days after the application is complete.
 EPA is extending the time that agricultural workers (i.e., non-handlers) are prohibited from entering the treated area.
 The entry prohibited period depends on the method of application, but generally the minimum period for worker reentry will be five days or until after tarps are perforated and/or removed.
 Applicator Training Programs and Safety Information for Handlers:
 EPA is requiring fumigant registrants to develop and implement training programs for applicators in charge of soil fumigations so these applicators are better prepared to effectively manage fumigant operations.
 The registrants also must prepare and disseminate safety information and materials for fumigant handlers (those working under the supervision of the certified applicator in charge of fumigations).
 Providing safety information to other fumigant handlers will help them understand and adhere to practices that will protect them from risks of exposure.
 The materials must include information on work practices that can reduce exposure to fumigants, and thereby improve safety for workers and bystanders.
 Good Agricultural Practices:
 Current fumigant labels recommend practices that help reduce off-gassing and improve the safety and effectiveness of applications.
 The Agency has determined that including certain practices on labels as requirements rather than recommendations will minimize inhalation and other risks from fumigant applications.
 Several fumigant products already incorporate some of these measures on their labels.
 Examples of good agricultural practices include proper soil preparation/tilling, ensuring optimal soil moisture and temperature, appropriate use of sealing techniques, equipment calibration, and weather criteria.
 Application Method, Practice, and Rate Restrictions:
 The Agency is restricting certain fumigant application methods that lead to risks that are difficult to address.
 These include certain untarped applications for some fumigants.
 EPA is also lowering maximum application rates to reflect those rates needed for effective use, thereby reducing the potential for inhalation exposure and risk.
 Restricted Use Pesticide Classification:
 All soil fumigant products containing methyl bromide, 1,3-dichloropropene, iodomethane, and chloropicrin are currently restricted use pesticides, but many soil fumigant products containing metam sodium/potassium and dazomet were not restricted use pesticides.
 The Agency has determined that all of the soil fumigants undergoing reregistration meet the criteria for restricted use.
 Therefore, EPA has reclassified metam sodium/potassium and dazomet as restricted use pesticides.
 Site-Specific Fumigant Management Plans (FMPs):
 (Fact Sheet; Templates) Soil fumigations are complex processes that require specialized equipment and practices to properly apply volatile and toxic pesticides.
 EPA's risk mitigation allows for site-specific decisions to address the conditions where the fumigant is applied.
 To address this complexity and flexibility, EPA is requiring that fumigant users prepare a written, site-specific fumigant management plan before fumigations begin.
 Written plans and procedures for safe and effective applications will help prevent accidents and misuse and will capture emergency response plans and steps to take in case an accident occurs.
 Fumigators will capture in the FMP how they are complying with label requirements.
 FMPs will help ensure fumigators successfully plan all aspects of a safe fumigation, and will be an important tool for federal, state, tribal, and local officials to verify compliance with labeling.
 The certified applicator supervising the fumigation must verify in writing that the FMP is current and accurate before beginning the fumigation.
 A post-application summary describing any deviations that may have occurred from the FMP will also be required within 30 days of the end of the application.
 The fumigator and the owner/operator of the fumigated field must keep the FMP and post-application summary for two years and make them available upon request to federal, state, tribal, and local enforcement officials.
 Emergency Preparedness and Response Requirements:
 (Fact Sheet) Although buffers and other mitigation will prevent many future incidents, it is likely that some incidents will still occur due to accidents, errors, and/or unforeseen weather conditions.
 Early detection and appropriate response to accidental chemical releases is an effective means of reducing risk.
 Preparedness for these types of situations is an important part of the suite of measures necessary to avoid risks posed by fumigants.
 First Responder Education:
 EPA is requiring registrants to provide information to first responders in high fumigant use areas.
 This will help to ensure that emergency responders are prepared to effectively identify and respond to fumigant exposure incidents.
 Site-Specific Response and Management Activities:
 EPA is requiring site-specific measures in areas where bystanders may be close to fumigant buffer zones.
 Fumigators may choose either to monitor the buffer perimeter or to provide emergency response information directly to neighbors.
 If site specific measures are required, and the fumigator chooses to monitor, the emergency response plan stated in the Fumigant Management Plan must be implemented if the persons monitoring detect fumigants moving outside the buffer zone toward places where people are.
 This monitoring must be done during the full buffer zone time period at times when the greatest potential exists for fumigants to move off-site.
 If the fumigator chooses instead to provide emergency response information directly to neighbors, the certified applicator supervising the fumigation, or someone under his/her direct supervision, must ensure that nearby residents and business owners/operators have been provided the response information at least one week prior to fumigant application.
 The method for distributing information to neighbors must be described in the Fumigant Management Plan.
 Compliance Assistance and Assurance Measures:
 Assuring compliance with new label requirements is an important part of the package of mitigation measures.
 Some but not all states have mechanisms in place to obtain information needed to assist and assure compliance with new fumigant requirements.
 Therefore, in states that wish to receive more information, fumigators must notify State and Tribal Lead Agencies for pesticide enforcement about applications they plan to conduct.
 This information will aid those states in planning compliance assurance activities.
 Community Outreach and Education Programs:
 EPA is requiring fumigant registrants to develop and implement community outreach programs to ensure that information about fumigants and safety is available within communities where soil fumigation occurs.
 Outreach programs will address the risk of bystander exposure by educating community members about fumigants, buffer zones, how to recognize early signs of fumigant exposure, and how to respond appropriately in case of an incident.

 Residues of pesticide fumigants and toxic industrial chemicals in freight containers represent a health hazard to employees and consumers, especially since freight containers are sealed for transport and distributed widely throughout the importing countries before being opened for unloading.
 We investigated 2113 freight containers arriving at the second largest container terminal in Europe, Hamburg, Germany, over a 10-week period in 2006.
 The countries of origin, type of contents and the pesticide fumigation history declared on labels attached to the container were recorded.
 We determined that 1478 (70%) containers were contaminated with toxic chemicals above chronic reference exposure levels; 761 (36%) even exceeded the higher acute reference exposure level thresholds.
 Benzene and/or formaldehyde contamination was 4-times greater than for fumigants.
 Our findings indicate a health risk for dockworkers, container unloaders and even end-consumers, especially as many of the cancerogenic or toxic gases elude subjective detection.
 1.
 How does fumigation work?
 Fumigation works by converting a solid into a lethal gas which is dispersed within an enclosed area and maintained at a prescribed concentration for a specified period to eliminate target pests.
 In Minnesota, fumigation is commonly used to treat grain infested with pests.
 2.
 What are the steps to fumigate and when is it complete?
 Fumigation requires several steps:
 1) Prepare site and determine dose; 2) Complete a Fumigation Management Plan (FMP) if required by product label; 3) Application; 4) Lockout site; 5) Monitor and reapply to maintain lethal concentration if necessary; 6) Monitor air temperature which may affect fumigation rate; 7) Complete fumigation period; 8) Aerate fumigated space; 9) Collect and deactivate any unused fumigant; 10) Dispose of any non hazardous wastes; and 11) Clear area for reentry.
 The time recommended on the label is the minimum minimum
 time necessary to complete the fumigation process.
 The end time cannot be pre-determined because the process could slow down with conditions.
 End time can only be determined by monitoring fumigant levels in the container over a period of time.
 3.
 Is a fumigant a pesticide?
 Yes.
 A fumigant is a pesticide.
 A pesticide is defined as a substance or mixture of substances intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate a pest.
 4.
 Does a person need an applicator credential to fumigate and apply other pesticides occupationally in Minnesota?
 The applicator credential in Minnesota is an annual license issued by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA).
 The Minnesota Pesticide Control Law requires that a person obtain a Commercial Pesticide Applicator License to apply a pesticide for hire, or a Noncommercial Pesticide Applicator License to apply any pesticide classified as a restricted use pesticide (RUP) as a condition of employment.
 Many, but not all fumigants are classified as RUP.
 5.
 How does a person determine if a pesticide is an RUP?
 The words �This is a Restricted Use Pesticide� will be written near the top of the product label on the front of the container.
 6.
 Does a person need a credential to fumigate on their own property?
 A person using a RUP fumigant in the production of an agricultural commodity on their own property, or as one of two or fewer employees in the production of an agricultural commodity must obtain a Private Pesticide Applicator Certification.
 Once a person has obtained a Private Pesticide Applicator Certification, they must add a Fumigation Endorsement which allows them to purchase and use a registered RUP fumigant.
 7.
 How does a person obtain a Pesticide Applicator License or Private Pesticide Applicator Certification with a Fumigation Endorsement?
 A person must demonstrate that they are competent to hold an applicator credential by passing a closed book exam.
 A person must also complete an application form for either a Pesticide Applicator License or Private Pesticide Applicator Certification and pay the necessary application fees.
 A person must meet financial responsibility requirements as defined by the Law to obtain a Commercial Pesticide Applicator License.
 A Commercial or Noncommercial Pesticide Applicator License issued by the MDA expires on December 31 and must be renewed annually.
 An MDA issued Private Pesticide Applicator Certification expires on March 1 three years after issue.
 See the MDA Pesticide Applicator Licensing web page for more details about license requirements.
 See the MDA Private Pesticide Applicator Applicator
 Certification web page for more details about certification requirements.
 8.
 How does a person maintain an applicator credential?
 MDA requires licensed persons attend recertification training every other year in order to renew an expired license.
 A certified Private Pesticide Applicator may attend an approved recertification training every three years or take an exam in order to renew their certification.
 Recertification for the Fumigation Endorsement is by test only.
 9.
 Does each person applying RUP fumigants need a Pesticide Applicator License or Private Pesticide Applicator Certification?
 The Law requires that every person obtain a license prior to applying pesticide for hire, or occupationally applying an RUP.
 A person who applies an RUP on their own property must obtain a private certification and a fumigation endorsement if necessary.
 MDA mails an ID card to persons who become licensed or certified.
 Lists of credentialed applicators can be found on the MDA web page.
 10.
 Can a person without a license or a private certification legally apply pesticide for hire or an RUP under the supervision of a credentialed applicator?
 No.
 The MDA does not allow a person to apply a pesticide for hire, or to apply RUP without first obtaining the proper credential.
 11.
 What fumigation support activities can a person perform without a credential?
 A person without a credential can help with the setup and site preparation prior to fumigation and the clean up activities after the space is cleared and the fumigation is complete.
 These tasks may include moving unopened product, sealing spaces and placarding in advance of the fumigation application, or breaking seals and disposal of wastes after aeration is complete.
 12.
 How many persons with a Pesticide Applicator License or Private Pesticide Applicator Certification/Fumigation Endorsement are needed on-site when a fumigant application is made?
 One credentialed person may apply a fumigant when no entry into a structure is necessary to complete the fumigation.
 Two credentialed persons must be on-site whenever fumigation requires entry into a structure.
 Only a person with applicator credential (Pesticide Applicator License or Private Applicator Certification with Fumigation Endorsement) is deemed properly trained to apply fumigant and perform the related tasks.
 13.
 What is a Fumigant Management Plan (FMP) and when is it required?
 Some fumigant labels now require a FMP.
 This document which the applicator completes for every fumigation describes the planned fumigation process.
 The US EPA and manufacturers agreed to adopt the FMP because of the human health risk posed by phosphine fumigants.
 Product stewardship agreements such as the FMP allow for reregistration of certain products while assuring protections for users and other individuals near the application area.
 14.
 Do I need to create a FMP or can I follow a template?
 Either an original or a completed template is acceptable.
 Templates are available on the internet.
 The Nebraska Department of Agriculture web page, for example, contains a document Guidance for Developing A Fumigation Management Plan (FMP).
 15.
 Who must complete the FMP and what information is required?
 A person credentialed as an applicator must complete the FMP.
 It must be specific for each treatment site, up to date, available for review, and carefully followed.
 Information on the plan includes emergency contact information, personnel credentials and notification, site logistics, application procedures and fumigation period, steps for sealing, posting, monitoring of site and after fumigation procedures.
 The product Applicator Manual contains a full list of FMP requirements.
 16.
 Is a FMP the same as a pesticide application record?
 No.
 An FMP is required by the product label.
 A pesticide application record is required by Minnesota law for certain licensed pesticide applicators.
 The 1990 Farm Bill requires private pesticide applicators keep application records of restricted use pesticides applied.
 Application records require different kinds of information than the FMP.
 17.
 What is a pesticide application record, what information does it contain and who must complete a record?
 A pesticide application record documents the application of pesticide at each site where pesticides are applied.
 When required, a person must complete the record as soon as possible after the application, give a copy to the customer where applicable and maintain a copy.
 MDA maintains samples on its web page showing the information required.
 18.
 What is fumigation in transit and when is it permissible?
 Commodities in railroad freight cars and ship holds may be fumigated while transported from one location to another.
 Fumigation is begun at the origination point, continues in transit, and concludes at the destination.
 The fumigation rate depends on temperature.
 At conclusion, monitoring shows the absence of fumigant, the container is aerated, unused product deactivated and the container cleared.
 Fumigation in transit is not permitted in truck trailers moving over the road.
 19.
 Is notification between the shipper and receiver required when commodities undergo fumigation in transit?
 Yes.
 The shipper/fumigator is required to notify the receiver/fumigator in advance of the shipment that in transit fumigation is underway.
 The notice can be in written or electronic, and must include a copy of the label, the Applicator Manual and the application record.
 It allows the receiver/fumigator to prepare for the arrival of the commodity and to complete the fumigation.
 This notice transfers the application responsibilities to the receiver/fumigator who must complete the fumigation in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, regulations,
 including shipments where the commodities cross state boarders.
 20.
 Is acknowledgment of a transfer notice necessary?
 Yes.
 The receiver/fumigator must acknowledge receipt of the notice.
 Documenting the notification and acknowledgement by both parties show each has done their due diligence.
 21.
 Who is responsible for the application?
 Minnesota Law holds the applicator and application company responsible for an application.
 In instances where the shipper and receiver may each be responsible for a portion of the application, the transfer notice and acknowledgement helps clarify responsibilities.
 22.
 How is the product label and Applicator Manual sent?
 The label and Applicator Manual may be sent prior to the shipment, or secured to containers holding fumigant.
 Documents accompanying shipments undergoing fumigation must be secured to the containers exterior near placards.
 Place documents on the first and last rail cars of a continuous and connected line, as long as no intermediate cars will be diverted.
 23.
 What is placarding and what placarding is required for rail cars that are fumigated in transit?
 Placarding is an important safety notice to persons who may not be aware the container is undergoing fumigation.
 A person opening a container unaware that it is holding fumigant could be seriously injured.
 Placards must be placed on both sides of each rail car or container holding fumigant.
 Placards must be placed in full view near each ladder and near each hatch.
 Placards may not be removed until the treated commodity is completely aerated and the application is complete.
 24.
 What information is required on a placard?
 A placard provides a warning that fumigation is underway.
 It must contain the signal word from the products label, warning symbols and a fumigation statement.
 A placard also records the product name, the date and time fumigation began, and the name, address and telephone number of the applicator.
 Placards are available from the product manufacturer or the internet.
 25.
 Who should people contact with fumigation questions or for more information?
 The MDA is authorized to regulate the use of pesticides in Minnesota.
 Contact MDA with questions about fumigation at 651-201-6615.

 Q.
 WHAT IS FUMIGATION?
 A.
 Fumigation is a method of using a lethal gas to exterminate pests within an enclosed space.
 There are two methods of performing a fumigation.
 One is to seal the structure with plastic, tape or other sealing materials, and the other is by enclosing the structure in a �tent� of vinyl-coated nylon tarpaulins.
 Q.
 HOW CAN I TELL IF MY HOUSE HAS BEEN FUMIGATED?
 A.
 Since 1961, the law requires that, upon completion of a fumigation, a sign indicating the name of the licensee, the date of the fumigation and the type of fumigant used be posted by the fumigator in either the attic or in the subarea of a house.
 These tags are to remain permanently and should not be detached.
 Q.
 WHAT PREPARATIONS MUST BE TAKEN BEFORE A HOUSE IS FUMIGATED?
 A.
 All persons, pets and plants must be removed from the structure prior to fumigation.
 (This includes fish and seeds or bulbs intended for planting).
 Medicines, feed, and food not sealed in metal, glass or highly resistant containers must be removed from the structure or sealed in protective bags as recommended by the fumigant manufacturer.
 Ask your fumigator any questions you have regarding the fumigation.
 Q.
 WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT MY HOUSE SHOULD I GIVE MY TERMITE COMPANY PRIOR TO FUMIGATION?
 A.
 Your termite company is required to ask you about the presence of any construction elements, conduits, drains, or vacuum systems that could allow passage of the fumigant from your home to adjacent or adjoining structures.
 Q.
 HOW LONG DOES A FUMIGATION TAKE?
 A.
 The length of time required for a fumigation varies.
 A fumigation can take anywhere from six hours to one week depending on the type of infestation, dosage, temperature, size of the structure and other factors.
 Q.
 WHAT DOES THE FUMIGANT SMELL LIKE?
 A.
 Structural fumigants are odorless.
 Therefore, fumigators are required to release a warning agent such as chloropicrin (tear gas) within the structure at the time the fumigation begins and throughout the entire fumigation process.
 Q.
 WHEN DRYWOOD TERMITES OR WOOD BORING BEETLES ARE FOUND, MUST THE STRUCTURE ALWAYS BE FUMIGATED?
 A.
 No, fumigation is not always a required method of treatment for drywood termites and wood- boring beetles.
 Fumigation is an allencompassing treatment in which the gases permeate the entire structure, eradicating termites that are inaccessible, in addition to the visible infestations.
 If an infestation is contained in a small area(s), the termites or beetles may be eliminated by local applications.
 The inspector will use their professional judgment to determine, on a case-by-case basis, what type of treatment is necessary.
 If treatments other than fumigation are recommended, you should be aware that the localized treatments will not provide eradication of other hidden infestations in the building.
 Q.
 WILL FUMIGATION ELIMINATE ALL THE TERMITES AND PESTS IN THE STRUCTURE?
 A.
 No, subterranean termites require separate treatments to create a barrier between the structure and their nest in the ground.
 Under optimum conditions, the target pest will be dead or obviously dying by the end of the fumigation.
 Drywood termites can remain alive as long as a week after receiving a lethal dose of a fumigant.
 Lethal doses vary for different pests, depending on the type of fumigant used.
 It is entirely possible for household pests (such as spiders, cockroaches, etc.) to survive a fumigation with the dosage used for drywood termites.
 NOTE:
 Reinfestations of the target pest could occur following a fumigation.
 Drywood termites and some wood destroying beetles generate small pellets or dust that remains in the tunnels after the insects are killed.
 You may continue to notice these signs after a fumigation.
 This does not necessarily mean the fumigation failed.
 If you have any questions about the success of your treatment, contact your pest control company.
 Since fumigants have no residual effect, other household pests can reinfect after a fumigation.
 Q.
 HOW ARE OCCUPANTS OF A STRUCTURE NOTIFIED THAT A FUMIGATION WILL BE DONE?
 A.
 Before a structural pest control company applies a fumigant, it must have in its possession an occupant fumigation notice that has been signed by the occupant(s) or designated agent of a structure.
 The occupant�s fumigation notice must state the pest to be controlled, the proposed pesticide(s), including their active ingredients, and the caution statement.
 This form must state that a lethal gas will be used in the building on indicated dates and that it is unsafe to return to the building until a notice of reentry is posted by the licensee in charge of the fumigation.
 The owner should receive a copy of the occupant�s fumigation notice.
 Q.
 HOW CAN A CONSUMER FIND OUT WHAT FUMIGANTS WERE USED ON THEIR PROPERTY?
 A.
 Before a structural pest control operator applies a fumigant, he must inform the owner or owner�s agent and tenant(s) of the fumigants proposed to be used and their active ingredients.
 Also, this notification must alert the consumer to call their physician or poison control center and the pest control company in the event of a reaction after fumigation.
 The form should advise consumers to call if anyone entering the structure experiences symptoms of dizziness, nausea, reduced awareness, slowed movement, garbled speech or difficulty breathing within 24 hours and give any other symptoms of overexposure.
 The name of the fumigant used will be entered on the notice of reentry that will be posted on the door.
 This is in addition to the fumigation tag, which indicates the name of the pest control company, date of the fumigation, and the name of the fumigant used.
 These tags will be permanently affixed in the subarea and/or attic.
 (See question 2) 2)
 Q.
 WHO CAN ENTER A STRUCTURE WHILE IT IS BEING FUMIGATED?
 A.
 Chemicals used in fumigation are lethal! Exposure to fumigants in a structure being fumigated, even for a few minutes, will result in death or serious injury.
 Absolutely NO ONE can enter a structure until it has been certified safe for reentry by the licensee in charge of the fumigation.
 Warning signs are posted in plainly visible locations on or in the immediate vicinity of all entrances.
 To ensure that even the owner or tenant cannot reenter a structure, the company is required to put a secondary lock on all outside doors that only the company can open.
 These locks can be any device such as padlock, keyway lock or deadbolts from the inside which will prevent opening by anyone but the licensee in charge.
 Q.
 HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN IT IS SAFE TO MOVE BACK INTO A HOME WHICH HAS JUST BEEN FUMIGATED?
 A.
 The fumigator is required to post a reentry notice on the property at the time the structure is actually deemed safe for occupancy.
 The notice states that the building is safe for reentry, and gives the date and time that the building was released, the name of the structural pest control company issuing the notice, and its license and telephone numbers.
 Q.
 WHAT SHOULD I DO IF PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT IS EXPERIENCED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A FUMIGATION?
 A.
 If, within 24 hours following application, you experience headaches, dizziness, nausea, tearing, coughing, nose/throat irritation, develop shortness of breath, double vision, unusual drowsiness, weakness, or tremors, leave the fumigated structure and immediately contact your physician, poison control center, the structural pest control company and the Structural Pest Control Board to report the incident.
 Q.
 CAN A HOMEOWNER CONTRACT DIRECTLY WITH A FUMIGATION COMPANY?
 A.
 Yes, a homeowner can contract with a Branch 1 Fumigation company (to fumigate) by providing a copy of an inspection report (which identifies a wood destroying pest that can be eradicated by fumigation.) The Branch 1 company will issue a certification of fumigation to the homeowner and to the pest control company that performed the inspection within five days of the fumigation.
 The pest control company that performed the inspection will attach the fumigation certification to any reinspection report, notice of work completed or certification which it issues.
 Q.
 ARE FUMIGATIONS SAFE?
 A.
 Fumigations are highly regulated by the State of California.
 To perform fumigations, companies must be registered with the Structural Pest Control Board (Board).
 Pest control companies may also be required to notify local fire departments before a fumigation takes place.
 The State Department of Pesticide Regulation registers all fumigants used in California and contracts with each County Agricultural Commissioner to monitor their use.
 If you have any questions regarding safety of fumigants, chemicals or pesticides, you may call your local County Agricultural Commissioner.
 TORONTO (ICIS news)--The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday announced new restrictions on aluminum and magnesium phosphide pesticide products.
 The restrictions would prohibit all uses of the products around residential areas, increase buffer zones for treatment around non-residential buildings that could be occupied by people or animals, and create more protective product labelling, the agency said.
 "These new safeguards prohibit the use of these toxic pesticides near homes and impose restrictions to protect our families from exposure to them," said Steve Owens, assistant administrator of the EPA�s office of prevention, pesticides and toxic substances.
 Aluminum and magnesium phosphide fumigants were used primarily to control insects in stored grain and other agricultural commodities, the agency said.
 They were also used to control burrowing rodents in outdoor agricultural and other non-domestic areas, it added.
 The agency was expediting approval of the new labels, it said.
 The primary manufacturer of the products was already voluntarily implementing the changes, it added without identifying the producer.
 More information about aluminum and magnesium phosphide is available on the agency�s website.
 In related industry news, the EPA this week announced it planned to add 16 chemicals to its toxics release inventory list.

 India's Pesticide Industry:
 struggling to reach its potential potential
 Crop losses in India due to weeds and pests are estimated at around 30% of the total agricultural production.
 Use of herbicides per hectare is amongst the lowest in the world, and notably, the crop yield per hectare is also very low.
 Yet India needs to produce an additional 5 million tonnes per year for the next 20 years to meet its food grain needs of 300 million tonnes by 2020.
 It may be a highly challenging task but it is also a necessity and, to succeed, the plant protection industry will need to play a vital role.
 India is one of the largest producers of pesticides in Asia.
 Indian companies have developed process technologies for more than 30 pesticides, and pesticide exports from India are steadily on the rise.
 Many Indian companies have opened offices and stock depots in Europe and Australia to ensure quick delivery, and exports have increased in the last three years by as much as 15%.
 However, the industry seems to be passing through a financial crisis.
 The focal causes for this are rising costs of inputs, governmental duties and taxes, and the cost of capital.
 There are also high rates of excise duty both on intermediates and finished products, and excise and sales taxes account for nearly 20% of the cost of pesticides.
 The industry is also constrained by regulatory norms.
 At present, there are high data generation costs for different crops and pests, and the systems and protocols needed for registration of new products are extremely stringent.
 Export formalities for insecticides and pesticides are particularly cumbersome, and cause huge losses of orders and hence, of precious foreign exchange.
 There are also many spurious producers, who are cheating the Indian farmer at the cost of the plant protection industry.
 The industry finds it difficult to tackle these due to loose government regulations and inadequate rules.
 The Insecticide Act of 1968 is outdated in spite of several amendments that have been made.
 For example, there is no provision in the Act to deal with counterfeit pesticides, and the reputable companies, in whose name they are sold, have to prove to the satisfaction of the court that they have not manufactured any sub-standard materials.
 The global market in generic pesticides is likely to increase by 70% by the year 2005.
 It is expected that the strong fundamentals of the Indian pesticide industry, such as cheap availability of raw materials, process expertise, low operating costs and R& D strengths, will attract many foreign companies.
 This in turn should boost investment in research, and thus there would seem to be a bright future for agrochemical companies in India.
 However to boost the industry, the government will need to come up with more incentives.
 Smoothing the procedures for registration and export licensing would be a good place to start.
 Indian Pesticides Industry...
 growth to come from domestic turf turf
 Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy.
 Ensuring food security for more than 1.21 bn Indian populations with diminishing cultivable land resource is a herculean task.
 This necessitates use of high yielding variety of seeds, balance use of fertilisers, judicious use of quality pesticides along with education to farmers and the use of modern farming techniques.
 The production of Indian pesticides industry has almost remained stable at 82000-85,000 MT during FY10.
 In value terms, the size of the Indian pesticide industry was estimated at Rs.180 bn for 2010, including exports of Rs.100 bn.
 Per hectare consumption of pesticide is low in India at 600 grams when compared to the world average of 3000 grams.
 Low consumption can be attributed to fragmented land holdings, lower level of irrigation, dependence on monsoons, low awareness among farmers about the benefits of usage of pesticides etc.
 India, being a tropical country, the consumption pattern is also more skewed towards insecticides which accounted for 52% of the total pesticide consumption in FY10.
 Rice is the highest pesticides consuming crop in India forming 19.8% of the total pesticides consumption followed by cotton.
 Andhra Pradesh is the highest pesticides consuming state (22%) followed by Maharashtra & Punjab.
 India due to its inherent strength of low-cost manufacturing and qualified low-cost manpower is a net exporter of pesticides to countries such as USA and some European & African countries.
 Exports formed 55.56% of total industry revenues in FY10 and have grown at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 37.59% from FY06 to FY10.
 Prior to 2005, i.e.
 in the process patent regime, Indian companies focused on applied research and concentrated on marketing generic and off-patent products.
 Due to this, the R&D expense by Indian companies was lower at approximately 1% of turnover.
 Global companies focused on high-end specialty products and dominated the market for patented new molecules.
 Globally, pesticides companies spend 8-10% of their turnover on R&D.
 However, with the onset of the product patent regime in India since 2005, the Indian companies will need to increase R&D expense to meet competition from MNCs.
 Alternatively Indian companies can be competitive in the area of Contract Research And Manufacturing Services (CRAMS).
 With the advent of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technique, the use of biopesticides and Genetically Modified (GM) seeds has increased.
 Globally, GM seeds are used mainly for commercial crops like cotton, maize, soyabean and canola.
 In India, Bt.
 cotton is widely used and the acreage stood at 9.4 mn ha for 2010, a growth of12.17% over the previous year.
 Use of GM seeds may diminish the use of insecticides but the use of herbicides may improve.
 CARE Research feels that the demand for pesticides can be augmented only through sustainable growth in agriculture.
 With the government�s focus on development of the agriculture sector, the industry may see a better future.
 Domestic market will be the keygrowth driver for Indian pesticides industry in coming years unlike led by exports in previous years.
 Also, the Indian pesticide industry is likely to move towards the global product mix, with increasing use of herbicides and fungicides.
 Pesticide Industry Sales and Usage Usage
 EPA is responsible for regulating the production and use of pesticides in the U.S.
 under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
 Starting in 1979, EPA's Pesticide Program has issued reports that provide economic profile information on the pesticide producing and pesticide using sectors covered by the FIFRA mandated regulatory programs.
 The reports contain contemporary and historical data estimating the dollar values and quantities of active ingredients used and sold in the United States.
 In addition, the reports include data on imports, exports, firms, employment, the number of certified applicators, and the number of pesticides in use.
 The reports use the best available information from the public domain and proprietary sources.
 However, the numbers in the reports represent approximate values rather than precise values with known statistical properties.
 Pesticides are substances or a mixture of substances intended for mitigating, repelling, destroying and even preventing any pest.
 Therefore, like fertilizer industry, pesticide industry also offers great protection to the agricultural sector, which is a backbone of India.
 The agricultural sector in India is forced to ensure food security of more than one billion people in spite of the diminishing cultivable resources in the country.
 Therefore, this has necessitated the use of high yielding a variety of seeds, balanced use of fertilizer and judicious use of quality pesticides in addition to offering education to the farmers in the user of modern farming techniques.
 So, over the years, the pesticides industry has seen a great development in India and it is expected to further develop thereby creating more and more employment opportunities.

 Indian pesticide industry poised to grow 3.2% 3.2%

 New Delhi:
 After a subdued growth for over a decade, India�s Rs 7,000-crore pesticide industry is likely to grow at 3.2% every year for the next 2-3 years, a report from Rabo India said.
 Increased affordability of Indian farmers, the growing number of pests and diseases, shifting crop patterns, crunch in farm labour availability and better price realisation for farmers will drive the industry revival, the report said.
 "Crop protection chemicals (CPC) sales in the country will see a strong recovery in 2010 because of favourable weather, greater use of genetically-modified varieties which have lower irrigation requirements and the government�s policy initiatives to support oilseed crops in particular,� Vaishali Chopra, author of the Rabo India report, told FE.
 "High commodity prices this year will positively impact CPC sales.
 The sector will grow 3.2% in 2010 in value terms (excluding growth from exports) and the growth would continue in the longer term (next five years) provided domestic players manage to capture the off-patent market,� said Chopra.
 India accounts for 16% of global food grain output, but only 2% of global pesticides usage.
 Currently, 50% of the domestic pesticide market is controlled by multinational corporations (MNCs).
 In India, pesticide usage is limited to 167 lakh hectares.
 There are currently 218 pesticides registered in the country.
 Due to its low per-capita consumption, India presents a significant long-term growth potential for MNCs as well as generic companies.
 While MNCs play an important role in introducing newer molecules, there is growth opportunity for generic players in the off-patent market.
 �Most CPC companies in India are generic manufacturers.
 They are expected to enter into JVs or M&A deals with foreign players to get access to newer CPC molecules.
 This will certainly enhance their product portfolio and make them more competitive in the global CPC market,� said Chopra.
 Chennai:
 The outcome of Stockholm Convention to ban endosulfan capping a long-drawn campaign against the pesticide on health grounds may have brought cheers to the opponents but the domestic industry is crying foul suspecting an European link aiming to capture the Indian market.
 India and a few other developing countries extracted several exemptions, including a phase out period of 11 years to ban production and use of the toxic pesticide at the convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in Geneva on April 29.
 Expectedly, the endosulfan's opponents, particularly in Kerala where it was alleged to have claimed 400 lives and left about 4,000 people maimed, rejoiced over the outcome while a section of the insecticide producers blamed an European influence with "vested interests" in the conference for the decision.
 "The usage of endosulfan in Kerala is miniscule.
 There are lakhs of farmers in other states who use (endosulfan) without any health problem.
 Most of the sections that are against the production have links with a network from Europe," alleges Anil J Kakkar, Vice President of Excel Crop Care, one of the three producers of endosulfan in the country.
 According to domestic pesticide industry, endosulfan is the world's third largest selling generic insecticide, with a 40 million-plus market, valued at over USD 300 million, and India is the world's No 1 producer and exporter.
 "Hoechst AG Company of Germany invented the pesticide over 55 years ago (now stopped production).
 Now, Indian producers have over 70 per cent of the total market and this is what the European countries do not want," says Kakkar.
 Israel and China are other producers of endosulfan.
 The UN-backed Stockholm Convention has now placed endosulfan in Annexure A, a list of banned chemicals posing danger to human beings and environment, with some exemptions.
 "This means the conference has banned endosulfan.
 But, India has secured certain exemptions that will allow it to continue to use the insecticide on 22 select crops," says Harish Vasudevan, an environment activist from Thanal in Thiruvananthapuram.
 The crops include cotton, jute, coffee, tea, tobacco, beans, tomato, tomato, onion, potato among others.
 "It has also been decided that the convention will provide financial assistance to the developing countries to replace endosulfan with alternatives," says C Jayakumar of Thanal, an observer at the five-day conference in Geneva.
 At least 81 countries across the globe have either banned or declared phasing out of endosulfan, 12 nations have neither banned it nor permitted it and 27 including India, Pakistan and Mexico, Ethiopia, Uganda and Zimbabwe are using it, he said.
 However, Kakkar said the decision of 27 EU countries was a common one and 21 African countries followed suit as they were aided by European nations.
 "It's like, if you continue to use it, we will not buy your produce," he said.
 Many European countries use herbicides to counter weeds and unwanted plants in their cold conditions.
 But, Indian situation was different, he said.
 "Our hot and humid conditions need strong insecticides," Kakkar said defending the use of endosulfan.
 Countering this, Vasudevan said there were over 150 health studies published in international medical journals that prove scientifically that endosulfan causes serious health issues.
 "The latest epidemiological study by the Kozhikode Government Medical College has revealed the long term health issues caused due to endosulfan," he said.
 Of the total produce of over 12,800 tonnes of endosulfan in the world, three Indian companies Excel Crop Care, state-owned Hindustan Insecticides Limited and Coromandel Fertilizers Limited produce around 9,000 tonnes, accounting for over 70 per cent of the total world produce.
 These companies market the pesticide as Endosel, Hildan and Parrysulfan respectively.
 "That is one of the reasons that India is opposing the ban.
 Since India is a major producer, it does not want to lose out on that," said Dr S Malarvannan a senior scientist at M S Swaminathan Research Foundation, Chennai.
 M S Swaminathan Research Foundation founder and noted agricultural expert Dr M S Swaminathan and environmental activists like Vandana Shiva have also opposed the use of endosulfan.
 As one of the exemptions that India secured at Geneva meet was its "access to safe and cost-effective alternatives," finding them should become the focus, Malarvanannan said adding "there is an alternative for endosulfan in organic methods.
 In fact, organic methods can replace anything." anything."
 The furore against endosulfan started in 2001 after the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment published a report on its "negative effects" on human beings, a claim challenged by industry as "scientifically implausible".
 Ahmedabad-based National Institute for Occupational Health also gave a report against endosulfan in 2002 but the industry rejected it, saying the instrument used by NIOH cannot detect endosulfan residues lower than 1 ppb (parts per billion).
 Reports by O P Dubey Committee in 2004 and C D Mayee Committee in 2005 had said there were no links between the health issues reported in Kasaragod in Kerala and endosulfan.
 But, conclusions of Dubey Commitee, Sunita Narain of Down to Earth claimed, were "doctored." "doctored."
 The issue resurfaced again this month as the pesticide industry and environmental activists locked horns in the backdrop of the fifth meeting of Conference of Parties of Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, an official body that decides on the ban of any chemical produce.
 Kerala went aggressive in its opposition this time and Chief Minister V S Achuthanandan, who has been campaigning against endosulfan for years, staged a fast on April 25 and wrote to his counterparts in other states seeking their support for a national ban on endosulfan.
 The Karnataka Government had in March had written to the Centre stating that "a wide range of health problems have been reported to be caused by endosulfan and stimulation of central nervous system is the main characteristic of its poisoning." poisoning."
 The National Human Rights Commission in December last year had recommended to the Centre to take administrative and legislative action to ban the use of endosulfan, after considering the report submitted by the National Institute of Occupational Health.
 Indian Pesticides Industry has finally come out in open and demanded cut in central excise on pesticides in the upcoming Union budget for 2007-08.
 Agrochemicals Policy Group (APG), a representative body of the agriculture chemicals industry, has written to the Union finance minister requesting him to cut the central excise on pesticides from present 16 percent to 8 per cent from the next financial year.
 S Kumarasamy, APG chairman, said in a presentation before media that the heavy central excise duty was a burden on the farmers.
 APG has made several pleas to the Centre over the last three years seeking reduction of the excise duty on pesticides and related chemicals to lessen the burden on farmers.
 APG claims that the agriculture produce worth Rs 90,000 crore was lost during the last one year due to pests, diseases and weeds.
 Kumarasamy said pesticides are important and integral part of intensive agriculture.
 By controlling insects, diseases and weeds, pesticides protect the investments made by farmers.
 Rajju Shroff, chairman and managing director, United Phosphorus Limited and active member of APG, said that the global pesticide industry was as big as Rs 150,000 crore in size whereas Indian pesticide industry remained at just Rs 7000 crore.
 He blamed it mainly on higher central excise.
 He claimed that the anti pesticide industry campaign being run by some NGOs was making the situation worse for the industry as well as farmers.
 He said APG had taken a series of measures to educate the farmers on the safe and judicious use of pesticides.
 APG is working with one of the leading group of NGO�s called Confederation of NGOs in Rural India in this regard.

 Pesticide makers are upset with Michelle Obama.
 They are offended.
 Possibly even scared.
 In a letter, Mid America CropLife Association, an industry association representing more than 60 companies, sought to school the First Lady in the history of American agriculture, with a focus on how technology has increased yields:
 "Over time, Americans were able to leave the time-consuming demands of farming to pursue new interests and develop new abilities.
 Today, an average farmer produces enough food to feed 144 Americans who are living longer lives than many of their ancestors.
 Technology in agriculture has allowed for the development of much of what we know and use in our lives today.
 If Americans were still required to farm to support their family's basic food and fiber needs, would the U.S.
 have been leaders in the advancement of science, communication, education, medicine, transportation and the arts?
 "We live in a very different world than that of our grandparents.
 Americans are juggling jobs with the needs of children and aging parents.
 The time needed to tend a garden is not there for the majority of our citizens, certainly not a garden of sufficient productivity to supply much of a family's year-round food needs.
 ...
 "As you go about planning and planting the White House garden, we respectfully encourage you to recognize the role conventional agriculture plays in the U.S in feeding the ever-increasing population, contributing to the U.S.
 economy and providing a safe and economical food supply.
 America's farmers understand crop protection technologies are supported by sound scientific research and innovation." innovation."
 What has the pesticide industry concerned about a little old garden?
 Perhaps, it's because for about 50 years or so, the agribusiness industry has had a strangle hold on Washington D.C., and this organic garden is a small, but symbolic sign of change.
 As Michelle Obama told Oprah Winfrey:
 "We want to use it as a point of education, to talk about health and how delicious it is to eat fresh food, and how you can take that food and make it part of a healthy diet.
 You know, the tomato that's from your garden tastes very different from one that isn't.
 And peas -- what is it like to eat peas in season?
 So we want the White House to be a place of education and awareness.
 And hopefully kids will be interested because there are kids living here." here."
 It's worth noting that the pesticide industry letter was unyieldingly mild and respectful (contrary to what you might think, having heard the vocal backlash from the sustainable agriculture community).
 The letter ends with an invitation to contact the group with any questions.
 Here are some ideas for questions Mrs.
 Obama might ask.

 Why is the industry fighting so hard to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from screening chemicals currently in use for their potential to disrupt the endocrine system, a particular concern because even minute amounts of certain chemicals can wreak havoc on a body's reproduction and development, since the body can be tricked into treating these synthetic chemicals like hormones.
 The EPA is finally -- after years of delay -- moving forward with a plan to screen 64 chemicals, much to the chagrin of your organization.
 What's up with atrazine, malathion, and all those other weed killers that seem to be making frogs grow extra limbs, change sex, or otherwise grow strangely (or fail to grow at all)?
 Anything to that?
 The pesticide industry has been working for years on its own "education" programs.
 Is one garden, even a high-profile garden like this, really such a threat to your "outreach" efforts?
 Isn't a global increase of $52 billion in your business in 2008 enough that you can leave one garden well enough alone?

 Share | | | David Bianco�s rose farm in Selma, Oregon sits next to a private forest whose owners plan to conduct aerial spraying of herbicides.
 Lake Selmac, a popular recreational lake and campground, sits just half a mile from the forest.
 David, along with some of his fellow residents of McMullen Creek, have been fighting to stop the planned spraying.
 He�s raised concerns about the impact the herbicide might have on his roses, the impact it has on his father-in-law�s health, and the impact it might have on Lake Selmac.

 He has a right to be concerned.
 Pesticides are, by design, poisons made to kills things.
 Many of our waterways are already impaired by pesticide contamination.
 And now, if special interests have their way, people like David and his neighbors will lose a critical tool to keep pesticides out of their local waterways.
 The Senate is poised to pass a bill that would completely remove Clean Water Act protection of our waters from pesticide contamination.
 Let me repeat that:
 the Senate is poised to pass a bill that would completely remove Clean Water Act protection of our waters from pesticide contamination.
 This is madness.
 How could this happen?
 Thanks to disingenuous catchphrases and a cleverly selected bill name, the pesticide manufacturers were able to convince many in the House of Representatives to vote for H.R.
 872, and now the Senate is all that stands between this bill and the President�s desk.
 Unfortunately, the true effect of the so-called �Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2011,� which should more appropriately be called the �Reducing Environmental Protections Act of 2011,� can�t be wrapped into quick sound bites.
 These special interests used the complexity of this issue to turn Congressmen who typically work to protect the public health into conspirators in exposing our waterways and our bodies to more pesticides.
 The same efforts are now underway to quietly usher this terrible bill through the Senate.
 But with just a bit of education, we�re hoping that our lawmakers will see through the smoke and mirrors and oppose this bill.
 Here�s a quick primer on what the pesticide industry isn�t saying about the laws.
 We have two key laws that deal with pesticide contamination in our water.
 First, there is the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
 FIFRA, for the most, is about getting pesticides to market.
 Under this law, a pesticide manufacturer must apply to EPA to have its product registered, at which point the pesticide can be sold and distributed in the U.S.
 As part of the application, the manufacturer must submit to EPA results from toxicity and other tests to show that, in general, the pesticide will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment when used according to the label.
 When EPA decides whether to register a pesticide, it will consider the data submitted by the manufacturer and consider the potential health and environmental impacts.
 The end product is a label on the product that sets forth the way the pesticide can be legally used.
 The label is the law.
 Then we have the Clean Water Act, which focuses on the use of pesticides that are sprayed directly into or near waterways.
 If a pesticide applicator�the person or business actually discharging the pesticide�needs to spray a pesticide into or near a water body, the applicator must obtain and comply with a Clean Water Act permit.
 This permit specifically requires the applicator to take certain actions that can reduce the amount of pesticide that is released into the water body.
 The difference between these two protections is important.
 Under FIFRA, EPA sets forth the maximum amount of pesticide that can be used without causing unreasonable adverse effects on human health and the environment.
 Under the Clean Water Act, EPA requires certain steps be taken when a pesticide is used with the goal of minimizing the amount of pesticide that goes into our waterways.
 FIFRA alone cannot adequately protect waterways from contamination.
 The requirements under the Clean Water Act permit are different from (and more environmentally protective than) the FIFRA label requirements.
 For example, EPA�s proposed general permit for pesticides applied directly to water requires applicators to consider other non-chemical methods of controlling pests, prohibits use of any pesticide into a water body that is already impaired by that pesticide (or its by-product), and specifies the types of records that must be kept (among many other things).
 None of these things is required under FIFRA.
 The American Farm Bureau Federation has said that this bill would fix the issue of �duplicative pesticide permitting requirements facing farmers, ranchers and others who use pesticides." But actually, not only are the Clean Water Act protections not duplicative, but the permitting requirements do not apply to farmers or ranchers.
 The permit at issue here specifically cover four types of spraying in water and at water�s edge:
 mosquito and other flying insect pest control, weed and algae pest control, animal pest control and forest canopy pest control.
 Land applications of pesticides are not covered.
 Only those farmers whose crops grow in water bodies would be covered by these permits; farmers and ranchers� land applications of pesticides are not covered.
 In my earlier post, I mentioned that we have many pesticide-impaired water bodies in the U.S.
 One commenter noted that the pesticides impairing those streams are not the aquatic pesticides at issue in EPA�s permit and therefore that they do not impact water the way I claim.
 He�s right � these aren�t the pesticides causing the impairments that we know of.
 The fact is that our waters are rarely � if ever � tested for the presence of aquatic pesticides; but if they were, we might find even more impaired water bodies.
 Furthermore, the last thing you want to do to any water body already contaminated with pesticides is to add more pesticides to the mix.
 One of the major flaws in the FIFRA registration process is that EPA does not look at the effect of different pesticides have on human health and the environment when they are mixed together.
 In the real world, no pesticide is discharged in a vacuum; the Clean Water Act takes this real world circumstances into account, but FIFRA does not.
 The truth is that without these permits and without the Clean Water Act, we could see a growth in rivers, lakes and streams impaired by pesticide contamination.
 We could see more massive fish kills from improperly applied pesticides seeping into normally pristine water bodies.
 We could see more pesticides contaminating our drinking water sources.
 We will have fewer water bodies to fish in, to swim in and to drink from.
 When it comes to laws about poisons, don�t we want our decision-makers to base their decisions on reality, and not on catchy sound bites?
 Introduction Introduction
 Chemical industry is one of the oldest industries in India.
 It not only plays a crucial role in meeting the daily needs of the common man, but also contributes significantly towards industrial and economic growth of the nation nation
 (Last updated on 03.03.2008) 03.03.2008)
 Global Scenario Scenario
 The global chemical` industry, estimated at US$ 2.4 trillion, is one of the fastest growing sectors of the manufacturing industry.
 Despite the challenges of escalating crude oil prices and demanding international environmental protection standards now adopted globally, the chemicals industry has still grown at a rate higher than the overall-manufacturing segment.
 As per industry reports the pharmaceutical segment contributes approximately 26% of the total industry output and approx.
 35-40% is dominated by the petrochemical segment.
 Commodity chemicals is the largest segment in the chemicals market with an approx.
 size of $ 750 billion while the specialty and fine chemicals segment accounts for $ 500 billion.
 Some of the major markets for chemicals are North America, Western Europe, Japan and emerging economies in Asia and Latin America.
 The US consumes approximately one-fifth of the global chemical consumption whereas Europe is the largest consumer with approx.
 half the consumption.
 The US is the largest consumer of commodity chemicals whereas Asia Pacific is the largest consumer of agrochemicals and fertilizers.

 Indian Chemical Industry Scenario Scenario
 Chemical Industry is one of the oldest industries in India, which contributes significantly towards industrial and economic growth of the nation.
 It is highly science based and provides valuable chemicals for various end products such as textiles, paper, paints and varnishes, leather etc., which are required in almost all walks of life.
 The Indian Chemical Industry forms the backbone of the industrial and agricultural development of India and provides building blocks for downstream industries.
 Chemical Industry is an important constituent of the Indian economy.
 Its size is estimated at around US$ 35 billion approx., which is equivalent to about 3% of India's GDP.
 The total investment in Indian Chemical Sector is approx.
 US$ 60 billion and total employment generated is about 1 million.
 The Indian Chemical sector accounts for 13-14% of total exports and 8-9% of total imports of the country.
 In terms of volume, it is 12th largest in the world and 3rd largest in Asia.
 Currently, per capita consumption of products of chemical industry in India is about 1/10th of the world average.
 Over the last decade, the Indian Chemical industry has evolved from being a basic chemical producer to becoming an innovative industry.
 With investments in R&D, the industry is registering significant growth in the knowledge sector comprising of specialty chemicals, fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
 The Indian Chemical Market Segment wise is as under:
 - -
 Segment Market Value (billion US$) US$)
 Basic Chemicals 20 20
 Specialty Chemicals 9 9
 High End / Knowledge Segment 6 6
 Total 35 35
 The Indian Chemicals Industry comprises both small and large-scale units.
 The fiscal concessions granted to small sector in mid-eighties led to establishment of large number of units in the Small Scale Industries (SSI) sector.
 Currently, the Indian Chemical industry is in the midst of a major restructuring and consolidation phase.
 With the shift in emphasis on product innovation, branch building and environmental friendliness, this industry is increasingly moving towards greater customer orientation.
 Even though India enjoys an abundant supply of basic raw materials, it will have to build upon technical services and marketing capabilities to face global competition and increase its share of exports.
 As the Indian economy was a protected economy till the early nineties, very little large-scale R&D was undertaken by the Chemical industry to create intellectual property.
 The Industry would, therefore, have to make large investments in R&D to successfully counter competition from the international chemicals industry.
 India has a number of scientific institutions and the country�s strength lies in its large pool of highly trained scientific manpower.
 India also produces a large number of fine and specialty chemicals, which have very specific uses and are essential for increasing industrial production.
 These find wide usage as food additives and pigments, polymer additives, anti-oxidants in the rubber industry, etc.

 Dye Industry Industry
 The Dyestuff sector is one of the important segments of the chemicals industry in India, having forward and backward linkages with a variety of sectors like textiles, leather, paper, plastics, printing inks and foodstuffs.
 The textile industry accounts for the largest consumption of dyestuffs.
 From being importers and distributors in the 1950�s, it has now emerged as a very strong industry and a major foreign exchange earner.
 India has emerged as a global supplier of dyestuffs and dye intermediates, particularly for reactives,acid, vat and direct dyes.
 India accounts for 7% of the world production.

 Pesticides Industry Industry
 Chemical fertilizers and pesticides played an important role in the � Green Revolution� during the 1960s and 1970s.
 Indian exports of agrochemicals have shown an impressive growth over the last five years.
 The key export destination markets are USA, U.K., France, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, South Africa, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Singapore.
 India is one of the most dynamic generic pesticide manufacturers in the world with more than 60 technical grade pesticide being manufactured indigenously by 125 producers consisting of large and medium scale enterprises (including about 10 multinational companies) and more than 500 pesticide formulators spread over the country.
 India is the 4th largest producer of agrochemicals after USA, Japan and China.
 The agrochemicals market in India is Rs.4500 crores.
 The government is promoting research on the use of alternative and safe pesticides using neem seeds.
 A country programme entitled � Development and production of neem products as Environment Friendly Pesticides� is being undertaken by the Department of Chemicals & Petrochemicals with the financial assistance of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

 Pesticide industry questions CSE report report
 Our Bureau Bureau
 Sends letter to the CSE seeking scientific substantiation substantiation
 Mumbai , Aug.
 23 23
 The quantum of pesticide residue as reported by the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) "cannot, do not and will not cause any harm to Indian people," is the emphatic response of representatives with the Crop Care Federation of India (CCFI).
 They were reacting to the CSE's report on pesticide residues in soft-drinks and the health hazard it poses.
 The report had said that residues of lindane, chlorpyrifos, DDT, heptachlor and malathion were found in soft-drinks in quantities that were above the draft standards and hence harmful to health.
 But CCFI's Mr Salil Singhal, said that they had sent a letter to the CSE seeking scientific substantiation of how the miniscule levels of pesticide affects human health.
 CCFI is an industry body of the Rs 6,000-crore pesticide industry.
 Questioning why pesticides were being singled out, he told mediapersons that the industry was highly regulated and the Government has fixed maximum residue levels for pesticides used in the country.
 "Why is there no analysis on heavy-metals?
 Why not look at other contaminants?" he said, indicating that there was a plan to target the pesticide industry.
 Further, he said that pesticides contributed to the country's food-security and the industry had weaned away from harmful pesticides.
 Even an Aspirin or Vitamin B tablet becomes fatal when 25 or more tablets were consumed within a day.
 Common salt could be lethal to humans when consumed at four grams per kilogram of body-weight, the industry representatives said, putting the issue in perspective.
 When questioned why the industry was not taking a legal recourse if CSE's findings were flawed, Mr Singhal said that they would wait for a response to their letter and then decide.
 CCFI representatives, however, admit that there are no norms for ground water � part of the problem in the soft-drink issue.
 Besides, processed-foods and other food-products will have limits laid out in the proposed Integrated Food Bill.

 The chemical industry in one of the oldest domestic industries in India, contributing significantly to both the industrial and economic growth of the country since it achieved independent in 1947.
 The wide and diverse spectrum of products can be broken down into a number of categories, including inorganic and organic chemicals, drugs and pharmaceutical, plastics and petrochemicals, dyes and pigments, fine and specially chemicals pesticides and agro-chemical, and fertilizers.
 The Indian pesticide industry had advanced significantly in recent years, producing more than 1000 tones of pesticides annually.
 India is the 13th largest exporter of pesticides and disinfectants in the worlds and in terms of volume is the 12th largest producer of chemicals.
 Industrial Policy:
 the items, which require compulsory license are Hydrocyanic acid and its derivatives; Phosgene and its derivatives; Naptha/Gas cracker complexes producing and its ethylene, propylene, aromatic complexes manufacturing benzene, toluene & xylenses- o-xylene, ethylene oxide and polyethylene having a specific gravity of less than 0.94 0.94

 All proposals failing outside sectoral policy/caps or under sectors in which FDI is not permitted and/or whenever any investor chooses to make an application to the FIPB an not to avail of the automatic route.
 Petrochemical Industry Industry
 The petrochemicals industry in India had indeed made remarkable progress.
 In the initial years, the growth was mainly import�driven.
 As a result of the pioneering role of the public sector Indian petrochemicals corporation limited and the growth opportunities particularly in the polymers and fibers segments, several private entrepreneurs are now in the field.
 As for polymers or plastics consumption, it took over the 40 years from 1950 to 1990 for the country to reach the consumption level of 1 million tones.
 It contrast, during the last seven years or so, the consumption of polymers and plastics increased by more than a million tones.
 Petrochemicals are no longer considered an elitist material.
 They serve to effect cost and energy saving.
 What is more, they find wide application in the domestic and industrial sectors.
 Synthetic rubber supplements natural rubber.
 Engineering plastics have substituted scare metals.
 It is, however, in plastics that the revolution is on a grand scale.
 With their versatile applications plastics are in every home, office and public place.
 Metal buckets are now replaced by light weight, multicolor, better-looking products, glass milk bottles have been replaced by cheaper and easily manageable pouches, wooden crates for cold drinks have been substituted by plastic crates and wood and steel chairs have given way to chairs made of polypropylene.
 The list could go on.
 The curx is that plastics are and will remain an integral part of human existence.
 Agriculture is the lynchpin of the Indian economy.
 Ensuring food security for more than 1 bn Indian population with diminishing cultivable land resource is a herculean task.
 This necessitates use of high yielding variety of seeds, balance use of fertilisers, judicious use of quality pesticides along with education to farmers and the use of modern farming techniques.
 It is estimated that India approximately loses 18% of the crop yield valued at Rs.900 bn due to pest attack each year.
 The use of pesticides help to reduce the crop losses, provide economic benefits to farmers, reduce soil erosion and help in ensuring food safety & security for the nation.
 The Indian pesticide industry with 85,000 MT of production during FY 07 is ranked second in Asia (behind China) and twelfth globally.
 In value terms, the size of the Indian pesticide industry was estimated at Rs.74 bn for 2007, including exports of Rs.29 bn.
 Globally, due to consolidation in the industry, the top five global MNCs control almost 78% of the market.
 In India, the industry is very fragmented with about 30-40 large manufacturers and about 400 formulators.
 The per hectare consumption of pesticide is low in India at 381 grams when compared to the world average of 500 grams.
 Low consumption can be attributed to fragmented land holdings, low level of irrigation, dependence on monsoons, low awareness among farmers about the benefits of usage of pesticides etc.
 India, being a tropical country, the consumption pattern is also more skewed towards insecticides which accounted for 64% of the total pesticide consumption in FY07.
 India due to its inherent strength of low-cost manufacturing and qualified low-cost manpower is a net exporter of pesticides to countries such as USA and some European & African countries.
 Exports formed 39% of total industry turnover in FY07 and have grown at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 18% from FY 03 to FY 07.
 Prior to 2005, i.e.
 in the process patent regime, Indian companies focused on applied research and concentrated on marketing generic and off-patent products.
 Due to this, the R&D expense by Indian companies was lower at approximately 1% of turnover.
 Global companies focused on high-end specialty products and dominated the market for patented new molecules.
 However, with the onset of the product patent regime in India since 2005, the Indian companies will need to increase R&D expense to meet competition from MNCs.
 Alternatively Indian companies can be competitive in the area of Contract Research and Manufacturing Services (CRAMS).
 With the advent of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technique, the use of biopesticides and Genetically Modified (GM) seeds has increased.
 Globally, GM seeds are used mainly for commercial crops like cotton, maize, soyabean and canola.
 In India, Bt cotton is widely used and the acreage stood at 6.20 mn ha for 2007, a growth of 63% over the previous year.
 Use of GM seeds may diminish the use of insecticides but the use of herbicides may improve.
 The demand for pesticides can be augmented only through sustainable growth in agriculture, according to the report.
 With the government�s focus on development of the agriculture sector, the industry may see a better future.
 The Indian pesticide industry is also likely to move towards the global product mix, with an increase in the use of herbicides and fungicides.
 Exports will continue to remain the growth driver.

 Pesticide Industry Panel Summary Summary
 Prepared by:
 Jessica M.
 Rockwood Rockwood
 BASF, Bayer Environmental Science, Bestnet, Clarke Mosquito Control, Sumitomo, Syngenta and Vestergaard Frandsen were represented by the newly formed Vector Control Project Team (VCPT) of Crop Life International.
 The group was formed to ensure the promotion of investment in new solutions, assuring safety and sustainability, sharing responsibilities and compliance, and timely access to technology.
 Additionally, the VCPT felt strongly that the Pesticide Industry can offer excellence in R&D, expertise and knowledge in vector control.
 Based on this experience and in an attempt to streamline the current Public Health regulatory landscape, the VCPT submitted a white paper based on the challenges which include limited market size, difficulty to re-purpose agrochemical products, higher regulatory costs, longer and complex registration processes (can take as long as 5 years), and a lack of incentives to invest in specific new chemistries for Public Health.
 While the VCPT fully supports WHOPES, the following should be streamlined:
 ?
 Encourage public/private partnerships for new product development (leveraging resources a la IVCC) IVCC)
 ?
 Establish a harmonized set of public health product registration requirements requirements
 ?
 Review new actives and end use products with relevant risk/benefit assessments for human safety, disease control and lives potentially saved saved
 ?
 Establish one universal dossier package assessed by work-share review by relevant experts from global regulatory bodies and stakeholder countries countries
 ?
 Following the work-share data review, registration and re-registration decisions to be fast-tracked in countries to improve speed and consistency of public health product registrations (e.g.
 OECD or European model) model)
 The strengthening of WHOPES should also be encouraged by establishing work-share arrangements with regulatory bodies such as USEPA, EU, etc.
 by forming an International Data Review Team which would constitute countries, WHOPES, and regulatory bodies.
 The proposal for an improved scheme recommends that all recommendations be based on the following:
 ?
 established WHOPES guidelines guidelines
 ?
 new guidelines guidelines
 ?
 open dialogue between scientific experts, WHOPES, and the developing company company
 ?
 develop guidelines to quantify institutions to execute WHOPES-compatible efficacy studies studies
 ?
 data must prove equivalence of me-too products products
 ?
 WHOPES to provide guidance to countries to establish eco-geographic areas or zones for efficacy trials trials
 In general, VCPT requests a scheme that includes transparency, consistency, speed, and universal acceptance which will enable new tools being brought to market.
 The IVCC clarified that the major barrier to innovation is the market size as the cost of developing a totally new insecticide active ingredient for Public Health is estimated at $100-150 million against a market size of $400 million.
 The time to development is also another challenge when coupled with a limited number of suitable available insecticide active ingredients not already recommended by WHOPES, but also a limited number of suitable field trial sites.
 As identified by VCPT, IVCC also highlights regulatory uncertainties as a major barrier and harder to develop a case, large numbers of countries with different processes, costs, and timelines, long overall regulatory process for products and no process for approving innovative approaches to vector control.
 Recommendations include:
 ?
 Product quality delivered by Global performance standards for each product class (with targets and clearly defines pass/fail) pass/fail)
 ?
 Safety delivered by a risk based regulatory process, which is transparent, published, and standardized standardized
 ?
 All testing carried out by independent GLP audited labs and field trial sites sites
 ?
 Clearly defined published and publicized overall regulatory process process
 ?
 A defined process for setting new standards for new class of products and reviewing and changing standards for current product classes classes
 IIC, however, presented the advantages to the current WHO procedures as the only truly independent data generated by an independent institution who can guarantee the effects as described by companies.
 IIC believe that Private Sector data may not be correlated to field results and proposes a faster method of replicating the tunnel test effect by changing the exposure time to 5 or 10 minutes so evaluation is easier.
 A sound of caution was provided by Killgerm Group Ltd.
 based on a WHO report entitled �Public Health Significance of Urban Pests� that notes the need to be careful when amateurs utilize pesticides as it leads to medical conditions and problems; this needs to be enforced.
 The cost of approvals is also a cause for concern based on the 80% loss of active ingredients in Europe in a 1998 review.
 It should be noted that no time was given for Question & Answer and therefore cannot be reported.

 Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (Philippines)From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia encyclopedia
  Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority Authority
  The Philippines' Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (Filipino:
 This is now banned from the philipppines philipppines
   HistoryIn 1972-1973, Philippines was beset by rice production shortfalls resulting from the series of typhoons and floods and fertilizer shortages spawned by the oil crisis.
 The resulting fourfold drop in rice production prompted the government to directly intervene in the operations of the fertilizer industry through the issuance of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No.
 135 dated February 22, 1973, creating the Fertilizer Industry Authority (FIA).
 Now since pesticides are ot good the philippines is not selling fertilizers and pesticides any more.
 Fertilizer and pesticide are vital agricultual inputs in food production and must be supplied in adequate quantities at reasonable costs at all times.
 The fertilizer and pesticide industries have much in common in terms of clientele, distribution channels, system of application in farmers' fields and technical supervision by the same farm management technicians under the government's food production program.
 In view hereof, the government abolished the FIA and created the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority on May 30, 1977 by virtue of P.D.
 1144.
 The FPA is mandated to assure adequate supplies of fertilizer and pesticide at reasonable prices; rationalize the manufacture and marketing of fertilizer; protect the public from the risks inherent in the use of pesticides; and educate the agricultural sector in the use of these inputs.
 It is attached to the Department of Agriculture.
  VisionSustained agricultural productivity in a wholesome environment through integrated plant nutrients management and safe crop protection systems.

 Industry Overview.
  India is predominantly an agricultural economy.
 Pesticide plays a significant role in enhancing agricultural productivity.
 Pesticides help reduce crop losses and thereby increase food safety and revenues for farmers.
  The domestic market depends on multitude of factors like monsoons, crop yield, pest attack, etc.
 and is relatively detached from the global dynamics.
 The domestic pesticide industry is highly seasonal in nature; the demand for pesticides is skewed towards kharif season (July � November).
  Bulk of the consumption in the domestic markets is of insecticides followed by fungicides and herbicides, unlike, high herbicide and fungicide usage globally.
 Biopesticides, which are derived from natural sources, are intrinsically less harmful than chemical pesticides.
 The market share for biopesticides in India is insignificant.
  On the supply side, the industry is characterized by over capacity & low off take leading to intense price competition among players.
 Spurious pesticides are a big nuisance and form almost 30%-33% of the domestic market size.
  Per hectare consumption of pesticides in India is paltry and usage is limited to few crops like cotton, rice leaving the gamut of so many other crops bereft from the benefits of pesticides.
  Low capital intensity & absence of product patent till 2005, induced many formulators to enter the market; hence the industry is highly fragmented with 30-40 large manufacturers and about 400 formulators.
  Certain Indian Companies have made a mark for themselves in the world markets.
 India is now recognized as an important source for supply of generic products and is a net exporter of pesticides.
  Currently R&D expense as a % of turnover in India is about 1% whereas globally it is very high at 11-12%.
 About 70% of all pesticides used in India are generics.
 Rating Methodology:
 CARE emphasizes on both quantitative as well as qualitative factors while rating pesticide companies.
 Quantitative analysis involves analyzing contribution from various product lines, export sales, operating efficiency etc.
 While qualitative analysis comprises analyzing the R&D capabilities, number of product registrations, product range, brand building efforts, etc.
 Rating Methodology for Pesticide Companies.
 2 CAREVIEW CAREVIEW
 CARE has identified following seven factors for the analysis of pesticide companies:
 1.
 Product Portfolio Portfolio
 2.
 Operating Efficiency Efficiency
 3.
 R&D Capabilities Capabilities
 4.
 Number of Product Registrations /Acquisitions /Acquisitions
 5.
 Distribution Network Network
 6.
 Brand building & Product Awareness Measures Measures
 7.
 Exports Exports
 Diversified Product Portfolio:
 Most of the domestic pesticide (insecticide) usage is biased towards cotton crop.
 With growing acceptance for the Bt cotton, the insecticide demand will be affected going forward.
 Globally, GM seeds usage has been spreading to other crops like soyabean, maize, canola, etc.
 These developments make it imperative for companies to focus on other crops besides cotton, and allied agricultural products like seeds, GM seeds, for future growth.
 Also, due to growing pest resistance and newer pest attacks/ diseases, it is essential for the companies to introduce new products/ molecules at regular intervals and provide newer solutions to crop problems.
 Given the level of competition and nature of the market; diversified product range, ability to manufacture products with complexity, presence in allied products and services significantly enhances the competitiveness of the company.
 These factors have positive bearing on the analysis.
 Operating Efficiency:
 The industry is working capital intensive.
 Due to seasonal nature of the business and the uncertainties related to timing and coverage of monsoon, level of pest infestation etc.
 a large inventory is required to be maintained by the companies.
 Further, the industry needs to offer long credit periods to farmers due to intense competition and low off take.
 Also, farmers have little surplus money left for purchasing pesticides, as pesticides are the last link in agriculture operation.
 This leads to higher bad debts in events of crop failure or poor monsoon.
 Steps taken by the company for working capital cycle management such as credit insurance cover on receivables, non-recourse factoring, efficient supply chain management etc.
 are viewed favorably for the analysis.
 R&D Capabilities:
 Due to lack of patents and data protection MNCs have been careful in introducing their successful molecules in India only after their patents have expired.
 Due to this Indian agriculture market has been deprived of the benefits of newer and more effective pesticides.
 CREDIT ANALYSIS & RESEARCH LIMITED 3 3
 With the onset of product patent in India, MNCs are expected to launch newer molecules and to withstand the competition; strong R&D capabilities and investments in R&D will be critical for Indian companies.
 Further, products registered and launched in mid 1990s are going off patent.
 These products are mostly registered in the US / EU and offer a great opportunity for Indian generics manufacturers to enter these stable markets.
 Companies with strong R&D set up and proven abilities for applied research are better placed in terms of tapping these opportunities.
 Investments in R&D, R&D pipeline of new products and JVs/agreements with MNCs etc.
 are analysed by CARE.
 Product Registrations/ Acquisitions:
 As pesticides enter the food chain, GoI regulates their export, import, sale & usage.
 No pesticide is allowed for production or import without registration.
 For the exports, access to the markets is restricted through registration procedures stipulated by different countries.
 Registering agrochemical generics in US / EU is a time consuming process since it requires various types of studies to be carried out.
 One product registration takes about 3-5 years and costs about USD 10-15 mn.
 Registration process in India takes roughly 12-36 months.
 The investments both in terms of time and money act as effective entry barriers.
 Companies with high number of product registrations and patents are, therefore at an advantageous position.
 Globally, the agrochemicals industry is going through a consolidation process.
 This often leads to antitrust judgments, forcing these companies to dispose off some products.
 This represents an inorganic growth opportunity for Indian companies to acquire those products and helps reduce the gestation time required for establishing the product in those markets.
 CARE views ability to carry out registrations in different countries as per their regulatory requirements, higher number of patents, product registrations and acquisitions in the global market as a major strength for sustainable growth.
 Distribution network:
 According to CARE, pesticide companies having wide distribution set up and geographic spread in the domestic markets, are at an advantageous position to withstand the uncertainties due to monsoons and regional seasonality.
 It also provides them a channel for intensive farmer contact for educating them on new products & their applications.
 Companies with wide distribution set up are at better position to take on the competition.
 Brand building and product awareness measures measures
 As of now, the market for pesticides is a low brand conscious and highly price sensitive market.
 Due to dominance of generic products, there are several �me too� and spurious products products
 CARE�s ratings are opinions on credit quality and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any security.
 CARE has based its ratings on information obtained from sources believed by it to be accurate and reliable.
 CARE does not, however, guarantee the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of any information and is not responsible for any errors or omissions or for the results obtained from the use of such information.
 Most issuers of securities rated by CARE have paid a credit rating fee, based on the amount and type of securities issued.
 available in the market.
 In order to educate the Indian farmers and spread awareness about usage of quality pesticides, many large companies have started creating brand awareness for their products by organizing campaigns, setting up service centers & extensive farmer contact.
 Such efforts also help the companies in understanding the needs of the farmers and developing better products.
 CARE opines that brand building and product awareness measures undertaken by the companies will help them in strengthening their market position.
 Exports:
 The increased export focus of the Indian pesticide industry is a consequence of seasonal demand, better price realization in the export markets, global outsourcing opportunity, low credit periods in export markets, domestic overcapacity and tax sops.
 Also with the availability of low cost high quality scientist pool, India is emerging as a destination for undertaking contract research.
 To increase their global reach, companies are increasingly focusing on forming partnerships/ acquiring strong local players, who can provide support to register, launch and market products in their respective countries.
 While assessing pesticide companies, strong marketing footprint in various countries and partnerships with the local players in those countries are viewed favorably by CARE.
 Conclusion Conclusion
 The rating outcome is ultimately an assessment of the fundamentals and the probabilities of change in the fundamentals.
 CARE analyses each of the above factors and their linkages to arrive at the overall assessment of credit quality, by taking into account industry�s cyclicality.
 While the methodology encompasses comprehensive technical, financial, commercial, economic, and management analysis, credit rating is an overall assessment of all aspects of the issuer.
 Pesticide Industry Overview Overview

 Abstract Abstract
 World use of pesticides in 1999 was an estimated $28 billion at the user level, an increase of 1% from 1994.
 The market for herbicide-tolerant and insect-tolerant crops expanded to over $2 billion in 1999, representing a total crop protection market of over $30 billion.
 This increase was mainly a result of market expansions in the United States, Europe, parts of Asia, and Latin America.
 By 2004, world pesticide sales will decline to $27 billion annually.
 This represents a real decline in worldwide use of pesticides (in terms of 1999 dollars) at an average rate of 1% per year.
 The decline in pesticide usage will likely be offset by increases in pest- and pesticide-tolerant crops.
 The 1999 sales of pesticides are estimated at 2 million metric tons active ingredient, including user-level sales and exports.
 Volumes are expected to decrease about 1.0-1.5% per year to 2004, while inflation and higher-unit-value products could add a 2-3% rate of growth per year to the dollar value of the industry over this period.
 With the greatest sales volume and total sales values, the herbicides sector is the leader in U.S.
 pesticide sales.
 Because planted crops and treated acres have not grown substantially in the last few years, retail price competition continues at a high level.
 The introduction of herbicide-tolerant crops has resulted in a significant change in the mix of herbicide products used by farmers.
 This has pressured margins at all levels in the distribution chain as manufacturers are pursuing market share strategies more strongly in the contracted major markets.
 Exports are a major factor in the market for U.S.-produced pesticides, with the 1999 volume reaching an estimated 310 thousand metric tons of active ingredient.
 Non-U.S.
 markets currently represent about 30% of total U.S.
 pesticide production.
 Imports in 1999 amounted to 82 thousand metric tons of active ingredient.
 Pesticide industry sees European link behind ban on endosulfan endosulfan
 Chennai, May 1, (PTI):
 The outcome of Stockholm Convention to ban endosulfan capping a long-drawn campaign against the pesticide on health grounds may have brought cheers to the opponents but the domestic industry is crying foul suspecting an European link aiming to capture the Indian market.
 India and a few other developing countries extracted several exemptions, including a phase out period of 11 years to ban production and use of the toxic pesticide at the convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in Geneva on April 29.
 Expectedly, the endosulfan's opponents, particularly in Kerala where it was alleged to have claimed 400 lives and left about 4,000 people maimed, rejoiced over the outcome while a section of the insecticide producers blamed an European influence with "vested interests" in the conference for the decision.
 "The usage of endosulfan in Kerala is miniscule.
 There are lakhs of farmers in other states who use (endosulfan) without any health problem.
 Most of the sections that are against the production have links with a network from Europe," alleges Anil J Kakkar, Vice President of Excel Crop Care, one of the three producers of endosulfan in the country.
 According to domestic pesticide industry, endosulfan is the world's third largest selling generic insecticide, with a 40 million-plus market, valued at over USD 300 million, and India is the world's No 1 producer and exporter.
 "Hoechst AG Company of Germany invented the pesticide over 55 years ago (now stopped production).
 Now, Indian producers have over 70 per cent of the total market and this is what the European countries do not want," says Kakkar.
 Israel and China are other producers of endosulfan.
 The UN-backed Stockholm Convention has now placed endosulfan in Annexure A, a list of banned chemicals posing danger to human beings and environment, with some exemptions.
 "This means the conference has banned endosulfan.
 But, India has secured certain exemptions that will allow it to continue to use the insecticide on 22 select crops," says Harish Vasudevan, an environment activist from Thanal in Thiruvananthapuram.
 The crops include cotton, jute, coffee, tea, tobacco, , beans, tomato, tomato, onion, potato among others.
 "It has also been decided that the convention will provide financial assistance to the developing countries to replace endosulfan with alternatives," says C Jayakumar of Thanal, an observer at the five-day conference in Geneva.
 At least 81 countries across the globe have either banned or declared phasing out of endosulfan, 12 nations have neither banned it nor permitted it and 27 including India, Pakistan and Mexico, Ethiopia, Uganda and Zimbabwe are using it, he said.
 However, Kakkar said the decision of 27 EU countries was a common one and 21 African countries followed suit as they were aided by European nations.
 "It's like, if you continue to use it, we will not buy your produce," he said.
 Many European countries use herbicides to counter weeds and unwanted plants in their cold conditions.
 But, Indian situation was different, he said.
 "Our hot and humid conditions need strong insecticides," Kakkar said defending the use of endosulfan.
 Countering this, Vasudevan said there were over 150 health studies published in international medical journals that prove scientifically that endosulfan causes serious health issues.
 "The latest epidemiological study by the Kozhikode Government Medical College has revealed the long term health issues caused due to endosulfan," he said.
 Of the total produce of over 12,800 tonnes of endosulfan in the world, three Indian companies Excel Crop Care, state-owned Hindustan Insecticides Limited and Coromandel Fertilizers Limited produce around 9,000 tonnes, accounting for over 70 per cent of the total world produce.
 These companies market the pesticide as Endosel, Hildan and Parrysulfan respectively.
 "That is one of the reasons that India is opposing the ban.
 Since India is a major producer, it does not want to lose out on that," said Dr S Malarvannan a senior scientist at M S Swaminathan Research Foundation, Chennai.
 M S Swaminathan Research Foundation founder and noted agricultural expert Dr M S Swaminathan and environmental activists like Vandana Shiva have also opposed the use of endosulfan.
 As one of the exemptions that India secured at Geneva meet was its "access to safe and cost-effective alternatives," finding them should become the focus, Malarvanannan said adding "there is an alternative for endosulfan in organic methods.
 In fact, organic methods can replace anything." anything."
 The furore against endosulfan started in 2001 after the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment published a report on its "negative effects" on human beings, a claim challenged by industry as "scientifically implausible".
 Ahmedabad-based National Institute for Occupational Health also gave a report against endosulfan in 2002 but the industry rejected it, saying the instrument used by NIOH cannot detect endosulfan residues lower than 1 ppb (parts per billion).
 Reports by O P Dubey Committee in 2004 and C D Mayee Committee in 2005 had said there were no links between the health issues reported in Kasaragod in Kerala and endosulfan.
 But, conclusions of Dubey Commitee, Sunita Narain of Down to Earth claimed, were "doctored." "doctored."
 The issue resurfaced again this month as the pesticide industry and environmental activists locked horns in the backdrop of the fifth meeting of Conference of Parties of Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, an official body that decides on the ban of any chemical produce.
 Kerala went aggressive in its opposition this time and Chief Minister V S Achuthanandan, who has been campaigning against endosulfan for years, staged a fast on April 25 and wrote to his counterparts in other states seeking their support for a national ban on endosulfan.
 The Karnataka Government had in March had written to the Centre stating that "a wide range of health problems have been reported to be caused by endosulfan and stimulation of central nervous system is the main characteristic of its poisoning." poisoning."
 The National Human Rights Commission in December last year had recommended to the Centre to take administrative and legislative action to ban the use of endosulfan, after considering the report submitted by the National Institute of Occupational Health.

 2011-10-03 07:44:07 - Bharatbook added a new report on " Indian Pesticides Industry " which gives an overveiw, Demand, Supply Trends and industry analysis reports.
 Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy.
 Ensuring food security for more than 1.21 bn Indian populations with diminishing cultivable land resource is a herculean task.
 This necessitates use of high yielding variety of seeds, balance use of fertilisers, judicious use of quality pesticides along with education to farmers and the use of modern farming techniques.
 www.bharatbook.com/detail.asp?id=53019&rt=Indian-Pesticides-Indu ..
 The production of Indian pesticides industry has almost remained stable at 82000-85,000 MT during FY10.
 In value terms, the size of the Indian pesticide industry was estimated at Rs.180 bn for 2010, including exports of Rs.100 bn.
 " market research reports " "
 Per hectare consumption of pesticide is low in India at 600 grams when compared to the world average of 3000 grams.
 Low Low
 consumption can be attributed to fragmented land holdings, lower level of irrigation, dependence on monsoons, low awareness among farmers about the benefits of usage of pesticides etc.
 India, being a tropical country, the consumption pattern is also more skewed towards insecticides which accounted for 52% of the total pesticide consumption in FY10.
 Rice is the highest pesticides consuming crop in India forming 19.8% of the total pesticides consumption followed by cotton.
 Andhra Pradesh is the highest pesticides consuming state (22%) followed by Maharashtra & Punjab.
 India due to its inherent strength of low-cost manufacturing and qualified low-cost manpower is a net exporter of pesticides to countries such as USA and some European & African countries.
 Exports formed 55.56% of total industry revenues in FY10 and have grown at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 37.59% from FY06 to FY10.
 Prior to 2005, i.e.
 in the process patent regime, Indian companies focused on applied research and concentrated on marketing generic and off-patent products.
 Due to this, the R&D expense by Indian companies was lower at approximately 1% of turnover.
 Global companies focused on high-end specialty products and dominated the market for patented new molecules.
 Globally, pesticides companies spend 8-10% of their turnover on R&D.
 However, with the onset of the product patent regime in India since 2005, the Indian companies will need to increase R&D expense to meet competition from MNCs.
 Alternatively Indian companies can be competitive in the area of Contract Research And Manufacturing Services (CRAMS).
 With the advent of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) technique, the use of biopesticides and Genetically Modified (GM) seeds has increased.
 Globally, GM seeds are used mainly for commercial crops like cotton, maize, soyabean and canola.
 In India, Bt.
 cotton is widely used and the acreage stood at 9.4 mn ha for 2010, a growth of12.17% over the previous year.
 Use of GM seeds may diminish the use of insecticides but the use of herbicides may improve.
 CARE Research feels that the demand for pesticides can be augmented only through sustainable growth in agriculture.
 With the government�s focus on development of the agriculture sector, the industry may see a better future.
 Domestic market will be the keygrowth driver for Indian pesticides industry in coming years unlike led by exports in previous years.
 Also, the Indian pesticide industry is likely to move towards the global product mix, with increasing use of herbicides and fungicides.
 Global pesticide industry continues to find growth opportunities opportunities
 After a tough 2009, during which the pesticide market declined, the $45 billion global pesticides industry is expected to recover and register modest growth.
 However, a difficult pricing environment and market maturity will substantially limit gains -- especially for some of the most widely used products.
 Nevertheless, and despite the fact that pesticides are already used in essentially every country in the world, there is still considerable upside in the global pesticide market.
 Developing areas offer most promise promise
 The large and established markets of North America and Western Europe are expected to post below-average growth in the coming years, mainly due to market maturity and efforts to limit unnecessary usage of pesticides, such as restriction of commercial and consumer pesticide application in some Canadian municipalities.
 The same sluggishness is expected for the large, developed Japanese market.
 However, many countries in the Asia/ Pacific region are projected to post strong growth.
 Above-average growth in agricultural output in China, Indonesia and Thailand, for example, will boost growth for crop protection chemicals.
 Moreover, pesticide use in India and other less developed countries is becoming more common, creating growth in areas where there had previously been little or no pesticide usage.
 The emerging agricultural powerhouse, however, is in Central and South America.
 Brazil, already one of the world�s most potent agricultural producers, is expected to post growth well above the regional average, which itself is substantially faster than the global growth average.
 The pesticide markets in Africa and parts of the Middle East will also register strong growth, but much of the region will remain substantially underdeveloped as a market for synthetic pesticides.
 Regulatory considerations continue to reshape the market market
 Regulatory forces have a more profound influence on the pesticide industry than they do in most other segments of the chemical industry.
 The perpetual effort to replace environmentally damaging products with benign alternatives leads to an ever-evolving array of active ingredients.
 This evolution has led to drastic reductions in the use of some products, including bans on many products that were mainstays of the marketplace.
 As a result, growth of replacement products has been considerable.
 These products, such as those designated by the US Environmental Protection Agency as �reduced risk pesticides� include glyphosate, upon which the well-known ROUNDUP consumer and agricultural products are based.
 The US, Western Europe, Japan and a few other areas have the most stringent regulatory requirements for pesticides.
 However, nearly every country has some sort of regulatory framework in place that governs which pesticides can be used in specific applications.
 Pesticide industry opposes ban on endosulfan endosulfan
 Pharmaceutical News by Venu Kodimela 10 mnths ago0inShare ago0inShare
 Even as the demand for a nationwide ban on endosulfan gains momentum, the Indian pesticide industry has opposed listing of the pesticide as a �Persistent Organic Pollutant' (POP) under the Stockholm Convention, reports the Business Line.
 �Endosulfan is manufactured and exported out of Europe for over 55 years.
 There were no issues over its use until 2001, when the sole European manufacturer (Bayer CropScience) also decided to phase out the product from its portfolio,� said R.
 Hariharan, chairman of the International Stewardship Centre, a New York-based body representing generic pesticide makers around the world, while speaking to newspersons in New Delhi Wednesday.
 He pointed out that following the particular manufacturer's move, the European Union (EU), in 2005, withdrew all authorisations for use of plant protection products containing endosulfan.
 Two years later, the same multinational stopped manufacturing endosulfan, even while continuing with its sales.
 The same year, the EU sought listing of endosulfan as a POP before the Stockholm Convention.
 Endosulfan is the world's third largest-selling generic insecticide, with a 40-million litre-plus market valued at over $300 million.
 India is the world's No.
 1 producer and exporter of endosulfan, which accounts for about Rs 450 crore of its Rs 5,200-crore pesticide industry.
 The Stockholm Convention, to which India is a signatory, requires parties to eliminate or reduce the release of POPs into the environment.
 While a POP Review Committee of the Convention, in October, agreed on categorising endosulfan as a POP, a final decision would, however, be in the hands of a Conference of Parties in April 2011.
 In the meantime, some 60 countries, including the 27 EU members States and 21 in Africa, have favoured banning the agrochemical.
 �These economies account for hardly 12 per cent of the total global endosulfan consumption.
 Some of them, especially in Africa, have no choice, as they export cocoa and other farm products to the EU,� Mr Hariharan added.
 On the other hand, India, China and Argentina have come out strongly against the proposed ban.
 �Endosulfan costs just Rs 240-250 a litre, whereas farmers will have to pay 3-4 times more for substitutes.
 Moreover, it is soft on pollinators such as honey bees, while being beneficial for lady bird beetle, chrysoperla, trichograma and other friendly insects,� said Anil Kakkar, vice-president of Excel Crop Care Ltd � a major endosulfan producer along with Coromandel International and the public sector Hindustan Insecticides Ltd.
 On the other hand, the Kerala government recently urged the Centre to allow State governments to regulate the use of pesticides while announcing a relief package for the victims of endosulfan.
 All political parties and civil society groups have come out openly against the pesticide in the southern state.
 CSE "picketed" by pesticide industry employees employees
 Today the pesticide industry sent four employees to �picket� our office.
 We know that they were employees because when asked, they told us �We work at United Phosphorus Limited� a major producer of pesticides and added further �we have been sent here by our boss�.
 They brought with them posters and slogans.
 We offered them water, tea and chairs to sit on.
 This is the latest in the long-standing fight of CSE regarding the poisoning of Padre village because of endosulphan pesticide.
 It must be recalled, what this case is about.
 Pesticides represent a growing industry across the globe and have over $20 billion dollars in sales for the United States alone.
 There are several players in the pesticide industry, but the big players that take the lion's share of the business include Bayer Crop Science, Black Flag, Scott's and Spectrum Brands.
 An expanded list of pesticide companies is available from the National Pesticide Information Center.
 Bayer Crop Sciences Sciences
 Bayer launched the world's first synthetic insecticide--called antinonnin--in 1893 and established the Crop Protection research department in 1924.
 Currently, Bayer Crop Sciences enjoys over $8.5 million dollars in sales and is experiencing continuous growth.
 The company headquarters are in Monheim, Germany and consist of three groups--Crop Protection, BioScience and Environmental Science.
 Bayer markets products in the U.S.
 like Admire Pro Systemic Protectant, Synapse, and Temik to protect a wide range of crops from insects, worms and larvae.
 Black Flag Flag
 One of the most well-known names in pesticides in the U.S.
 for many years has been Black Flag.
 The company began selling pest-control products back in 1833.
 Their line of products include the Roach Motel, Fly Motel, Wasp & Hornet Killer and foggers.
 Black Flag is owned by Homax, a do-it-yourself products company that won Lowes Vendor of the Year in 2005.
 Scott's Scott's
 Formed in 1868 as seed company, Scott's merged with Miracle-Gro in 1995 to form The Scott's Miracle-Gro Company and has become one of the largest lawn care companies in the United States.
 Scott's sells such mainstays as Ortho (pesticides) and Roundup (herbicides).
 Under the Ortho brand, Scott's sells products like Ortho Max, Ortho Fire Ant Killer, and Ortho Bug-B-Gon for pests ranging from aphids and ants to snails and mice.
 The EPA ordered Scott's to quit selling four products in 2008 for being unregistered or mislabeled and 19 more in 2009.
 Spectrum Brands Brands
 Spectrum Brands, headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, sells pesticides under the Spectracide brand name and also has the Cutter and Repel brands of insect repellents.
 Spectracide offers both indoor and outdoor pesticides under the Hot Shot brand in the form of sprays, foggers, baits and powders.
 Under the Spectracide label, the company has pesticides for ants, Japanese beetles, wasps and hornets, and other outdoor pests like aphids, beetles, fleas and ticks.
 Raid Raid
 Raid has been one of the most well-known names in ant and roach control over the last few decades.
 The Raid brand, launched in the mid-1950s, is owned by SC Johnson, which was founded in 1886 by Samuel C.
 Johnson in Racine, Wisconsin.
 Raid has a wide range of products claiming to control ants, roaches, mosquitoes and other flying insects, and wasps and hornets.

 Pesticide resistance is the adaptation of pest population targeted by a pesticide resulting in decreased susceptibility to that chemical.
 In other words, pests develop a resistance to a chemical through natural selection:
 the most resistant organisms are the ones to survive and pass on their genetic traits to their offspring. offspring.
 Manufacturers of pesticides tend to prefer a definition that is dependent on failure of a product in a real situation, sometimes called field resistance.
 For example, the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) definition of insecticide resistance is 'a heritable change in the sensitivity of a pest population that is reflected in the repeated failure of a product to achieve the expected level of control when used according to the label recommendation for that pest species'.[2] species'.[2]
 Pesticide resistance is increasing in occurrence.
 In the 1940s, farmers in the USA lost 7% of their crops to pests, while since the 1980s, the percentage lost has increased to 13, even though more pesticides are being used. Over 500 species of pests have developed a resistance to a pesticide.[3] Other sources estimate the number to be around 1000 species since 1945.[4] 1945.[4]
 Rachel Carson predicted the phenomenon in her 1962 book Silent Spring. Spring.

  FactorsPropensity of pest populations to develop resistance is probably caused by a number of factors.
 First, pest species are usually capable of producing large number of offspring.
 This increases the probability of random mutations and ensures the rapid build-up in numbers of resistant mutants once such mutations have occurred.
 Secondly, pest species have been exposed to natural toxins for a long time before the onset of human civilization.
 For example, many plants produce phytotoxins to protect them from herbivores.
 As a result, coevolution of herbivores and their host plants required development of the physiological capability to detoxify or tolerate poisons.[5][6] Thirdly, humans often rely almost exclusively on insecticides for pest control.
 This increases selection pressure towards resistance.
 Pesticides that fail to break down quickly and remain in the area contribute to selection for resistant organisms even after they are no longer being applied.[7] applied.[7]
 In response to pesticide resistance, pest managers may resort to increased use of pesticides, exacerbating the problem.
[8] In addition, when pesticides are toxic toward species that feed on or compete with pests, the pest population will likely expand further, requiring more pesticides.
[8] This is sometimes referred to as pesticide trap,[8] or a pesticide treadmill, since farmers are continually paying more for less benefit.[4] benefit.[4]
 Insect predators and parasites which live on other insects generally have smaller populations and are therefore much less likely to develop resistance than are the primary targets of the pesticides, such as mosquitoes and those that feed on plants.
 This can compound the pest problem because these species normally keep pest populations in check.[7] But resistant predators of pest species can be bred in laboratories, which can help keep pest populations down.[7] down.[7]
 The fewer sources of food a pest has the more likely it is to develop resistance, because it is exposed to higher concentrations of pesticides and has less opportunity to breed with populations that have not been exposed.
[7] Other factors in the speed with which a species develops resistance are generation time and fecundity (shorter generations and more offspring lead to resistance more quickly).[7] quickly).[7]
  ExamplesResistance has developed in a variety of different pest species:
 Resistance to insecticides was first documented by A.
 L.
 Melander in 1914 when scale insects demonstrated resistance to an inorganic insecticide.
 Between 1914 and 1946, 11 additional cases of resistance to inorganic insecticides were recorded.
 The development of organic insecticides, such as DDT, gave hope that insecticide resistance was an issue of the past.
 Unfortunately, by 1947 housefly resistance to DDT was documented.
 With the introduction of every new insecticide class � cyclodienes, carbamates, formamidines, organophosphates, pyrethroids, even Bacillus thuringiensis � cases of resistance surfaced within two to 20 years.
 In the US, studies have shown that fruit flies that infest orange groves were becoming resistant to malathion, a pesticide used to kill them.[9] them.[9]
 In Hawaii and Japan, the diamondback moth developed a resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis about three years after it began to be used heavily.[7] heavily.[7]
 In England, rats in certain areas have developed such a strong resistance to rat poison that they can consume up to five times as much of it as normal rats without dying. dying.
 DDT is no longer effective in preventing malaria in some places, a fact which contributed to a resurgence of the disease.[4] disease.[4]
 In the southern United States, the weed Amaranthus palmeri, which interferes with production of cotton, has developed widespread resistance to the herbicide Roundup.[10] Roundup.[10]
 Colorado potato beetle has developed resistance to 52 different compounds belonging to all major insecticide classes.
 Resistance levels vary greatly among different populations and between beetle life stages, but in some cases can be very high (up to 2,000-fold).[11] 2,000-fold).[11]
 Although resistance development is usually discussed as a result of pesticide use, it is important to keep in mind that pest populations can also adapt to non-chemical methods of control.
 For example, the northern corn rootworm (Diabrotica barberi) became adapted to a corn-soybean crop rotation by spending the year when field is planted to soybeans in a diapause.[12] diapause.[12]
  Multiple and cross-resistanceMultiple resistance is the phenomenon in which a pest is resistant to more than one class of pesticides.
[7] This can happen if one pesticide is used until pests display a resistance and then another is used until they are resistant to that one, and so on.
[7] Cross resistance, a related phenomenon, occurs when the genetic mutation that made the pest resistant to one pesticide also makes it resistant to other pesticides, especially ones with similar mechanisms of action.[7] action.[7]
  Physiology and BehaviorFrequently a pest becomes resistant to a pesticide because it develops physiological changes that protect it from the chemical.
[7] In some cases, a pest may gain an increased number of copies of a gene, allowing it to produce more of a protective enzyme that breaks down the pesticide into less toxic chemicals.
[7] Such enzymes include esterases, glutathione transferases, and mixed microsomal oxidases.
[7] Alternatively, the number of biochemical receptors for the chemicals may be reduced in the pest, or the receptor may be altered, reducing the pest's sensitivity to the compound.
[7] Behavioral resistance has also been described for some chemicals; for example, some Anopheles mosquitoes developed a preference for resting outside that prevented them from coming in contact with pesticide sprayed on interior walls.
[13] Still other mechanisms include increased rates of excretion of toxic molecules, their sequestration and storage inside of the insect body away from vulnerable tissues and organs, and decreased toxin penetration through the insect body wall.[14] wall.[14]
 Often, mutation in a single gene only leads to the development of a resistant organism.
 In other cases, multiple genes are involved.
 Resistant genes are usually autosomal.
 This means that they are located on autosomes (as opposed to sex chromosomes).
 As a result, resistance is inherited similarly in males and females.
 Also, resistance is usually inherited as an incompletely dominant trait.
 When a resistant and a susceptible individual mate with each other, their progeny has an intermediate level of resistance (more resistant than the susceptible parent, but not as resistant as the resistant parent).
 Adaptation to pesticides usually decreases relative fitness of organisms in the absence of pesticides.
 Resistant individuals often have reduced reproductive output, life expectancy, mobility, etc.
 Therefore, relatively few of them persist in a population that is not exposed to a particular insecticide to which they have developed resistance.[15] resistance.[15]
 Blowfly maggots produce an enzyme that confers resistance to organochloride insecticides.
 Scientists have researched ways to use this enzyme to break down pesticides in the environment, which would detoxify them and prevent harmful environmental effects.[16] Later they discovered a similar enzyme produced by soil bacteria that also breaks down organochloride insecticides but which works faster and remains stable in a variety of conditions.[16] The product, called Landguard is used in Australia to decontaminate spray equipment, soil and water after pesticide spraying and spills.[16] spills.[16]
  ManagementPest resistance to a pesticide can be managed by reducing selection pressure by this pesticide on the pest population.
 In other words, the situation when all the pests except the most resistant ones are killed by a given chemical should be avoided.
 This can be achieved by avoiding unnecessary pesticide applications, using non-chemical control techniques, and leaving untreated refuges where susceptible pests can survive.[17][18] Adopting the integrated pest management (IPM) approach usually helps with resistance management.
 When pesticides are the sole or predominant method of pest control, resistance is commonly managed through pesticide rotation.
 This involves alternating among pesticide classes with different modes of action to delay the onset of or mitigate existing pest resistance.[19] Different pesticide classes may have different effects on a pest.[19] The U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or USEPA) designates different classes of fungicides, herbicides and insecticides.
 Pesticide manufacturers may, on product labeling, require that no more than a specified number of consecutive applications of a pesticide class be made before alternating to a different pesticide class.
 This manufacturer requirement is intended to extend the useful life of a product.[20] product.[20]
 Tankmixing pesticides is the combination of two or more pesticides with different modes of action in order to improve individual pesticide application results and delay the onset of or mitigate existing pest resistance.[17] resistance.[17]
 How pesticide resistance develops develops
 Excerpt from Fruit Crop Ecology and Management, Chapter 2:
 Managing the Community of Pests and Beneficials by Larry Gut, Annemiek Schilder, Rufus Isaacs and Patricia McManus.
 Home > Scouting guide> how pesticide resistance develops develops
 The role of population genetics genetics
 An individual organism's genes determine its physical and behavioral traits.
 When individuals reproduce, they pass along unique combinations of genes to their offspring.
 Different environments favor individuals with different physical and behavioral traits.
 Individuals with genes that improve their survival will be more likely to pass along these genes compared to the rest of the population.
 The mix of genes in a population is called the gene pool.
 The composition of the gene pool continually changes over time through a process called natural selection.
 With the help of plant breeders, fruit growers have taken advantage of the gene pool's natural variability in a process known as artificial selection.
 The first step in this process is to identify desirable traits, such as flavor, color, tolerance, or resistance to a pest.
 Once desirable traits are identified, these can be incorporated into new crop varieties through conventional breeding or genetic engineering.
 For example, apples have been bred to create a few varieties that are resistant to apple scab.
 Even without specific breeding efforts, fruit crop varieties display a natural range of resistance to various pests and diseases.
 When monocultures of single varieties are planted, efficiency of production is traded for diversity of resistance to pests.
 Effects of pesticide selection selection
 Repeated use of the same class of pesticides to control a pest can cause undesirable changes in the gene pool of a pest leading to another form of artificial selection, pesticide resistance.
 When a pesticide is first used, a small proportion of the pest population may survive exposure to the material due to their distinct genetic makeup.
 These individuals pass along the genes for resistance to the next generation.
 Subsequent uses of the pesticide increase the proportion of less-susceptible individuals in the population.
 Through this process of selection, the population gradually develops resistance to the pesticide.
 Worldwide, more than 500 species of insects, mites, and spiders have developed some level of pesticide resistance.
 The twospotted spider mite is a pest of most fruit crops and is notorious for rapidly developing resistance to miticides.
 Some plant pathogens have also become resistant to pesticides.
 Among fruit producers in North America, apple growers perhaps have faced the most significant problems with pesticide resistance.
 Examples include streptomycin resistance in the fire blight bacterium and benomyl resistance in the apple scab pathogen.
 Although the precise genetic and ecological factors differ among pests that have become resistant, in all cases resistance is driven by one process -- selection.
 Survival of the most resistant resistant
 Insecticide resistance resistance
 Selection for resistance can occur if a small proportion of the insect population is able to survive treatment with insecticide.
 These rare resistant individuals can reproduce and pass on their resistance to the offspring.
 If an insecticide with the same mode of action is repeatedly used against this population, an even greater proportion will survive.
 Ultimately, the once-effective product no longer controls the resistant population.
 Fungicide resistance resistance
 Single-step pesticide resistance arises suddenly in the field.
 A single gene or physiological function changes so that an individual becomes highly resistant to the pesticide.
 With just one or two sprays of the pesticide, the population shifts from mostly sensitive to mostly resistant individuals.
 This is the process by which populations of streptomycin-resistant fire blight bacteria and benomyl-resistant apple scab bacteria rapidly developed in commercial orchards.
 Multi-step pesticide resistance arises slowly in the field over many years.
 Rather than having distinct groups of sensitive and resistant individuals, the population consists of individuals with a range of sensitivities to the pesticide.
 With each pesticide application, those individuals at the more resistant end of the spectrum survive and reproduce.
 Over the years, the proportion of the population that can survive a pesticide spray increases, until that pesticide eventually becomes ineffective.
 This process is underway in apple orchards where the sterol inhibitor (SI) fungicides have been used extensively to control scab.
 The shift toward resistance leads to a gradual erosion of control.
 Resistance management management
 Growers can help delay the development of resistance by applying pesticides only when they are needed, by rotating between different chemical classes, and by using rates of pesticides within the labeled range.
 Integrating non-chemical approaches such as pheromone mating disruption and cultural controls can also help delay resistance.

 Brief Introduction Introduction
 We publish this data on the internet as a public service, for use by resistance management practitioners around the world.
 We encourage researchers to contact us with any resistance information they might have.
 Contact us if you have any difficulties with these pages, or with comments and suggestions.
 This is a database of reports of resistance cases from 1914 to the present, when the resistance is first discovered for a specific time and place.
 Pesticide resistance is a dynamic, evolutionary phenomena and a record in this database may or may not be indicative of your area.
 Similarly, the absence of a record in this database does not indicate absence of resistance.
 This database was made possible by grants from the US Department of Agriculture, CSREES Pest Management Alternatives Program, the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC), and Generating Research and Extension to meet Economic and Environmental Needs (GREEEN) Project # GR02-69, Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station (MAES), Michigan State University Extension (MSUE) and the Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA).
 Pesticide Resistance Resistance
 Pesticide Resistance is the ability of a life form to develop a tolerance to a pesticide.
 Pests (weeds, insects, mites, diseases, etc.) that become resistant to a pesticide will not be affected by the pesticide.
 When pests are resistant, it is more difficult to control the pest.
 Therefore, it is important to try to prevent pesticide resistance.
 Sometimes scientists breed pesticide resistance into plants.
 These plants will not be affected by that pesticide, and when the pesticide is used on a resistant crop it does not harm the crop.
 For example, roundup ready canola can be treated with roundup to control weeds.
 The weeds will die, but the canola is not affected.
 Plants may also be resistant to certain pests.
 These plants will not be affected by the pest.
 Using resistant plants is an effective control method that should be part of IPM programs.

 How Resistance Develops Develops
 Resistance usually develops by genetic mutation and selection.
 Types of mutations can include:
 a change in processes in the pest that make the pesticide harmless, a change in the place where the pesticide enters the pest so it cannot enter, or a change in the behavior of the pest so that it avoids the pesticide.
 Resistant pests are selected when the pests reproduce.
 For example, in any pest population there may be some pests that will not be killed by the pesticide.
 When the pests that survive breed, some of their young will inherit the pesticide resistance.
 These pests will not be affected the next time the pesticide is used.
 With each generation, the pest population becomes more difficult to control with the same pesticide.
 If the same pesticide is applied often, there will be more resistant pests than susceptible pests.

 Development of Pesticide Resistance Resistance
 Managing Resistance Resistance
 Pesticide resistance develops when pesticides are used too often and when the same pesticide or similar pesticides are used over and over again.
 Reduce the development of pesticide resistance by:
 �Only using pesticides when necessary necessary
 �Using pest tolerant or resistant plant varieties varieties
 �Using cultural controls controls
 �Using biological controls controls
 �Monitoring to make sure pesticides are applied at the most effective time time
 �Using selective pesticides that break down quickly quickly
 �Only using tank mixtures of pesticides that have different sites of action action
 �Using the recommended application rate rate
 �Getting complete coverage so all plant parts receive the proper pesticide dose dose
 �Avoiding use of low rates with marginal pest control control
 �If there is more than one generation of pest, alternate different pesticide groups groups
 �If the pesticide doesnt work, do not re-treat with a pesticide in the same group group
 �Alternating pesticides or pesticides in different groups* groups*
 All these practices are part of integrated pest management (IPM).
 The Crop production Guides provide information on IPM for specific crops and pests.

 Pesticide Resistance Management Groups Groups
 Pesticides have been grouped according to how they work (site of action).
 Reduce the development of pesticide resistance by alternating pesticides from the different groups.
 The resistance management group is printed on some pesticide labels, as shown in the example to the right.

 Insecticide resistance resistance
 Resistance monitoring should be an integral part of vector/public health pest control programmes.
 Knowledge of vector/pest susceptibility to pesticides, changing trends of resistance and their operational implications are basic requirements to guide pesticide use in vector-borne disease and pest control programmes.
 This information provides a basis for selecting pesticide(s), for ascertaining continued susceptibility to and efficacy of pesticide(s) in use, and for vector/pest pesticide resistance management.
 Insecticide resistance monitoring monitoring
 Test procedures for insecticide resistance monitoring in malaria vectors, bio-efficacy and persistence of insecticide on treated surfaces, Geneva, World Health Organization, 1998.
 Insect pests are a major economic and health problem.
 The evolution of resistance to pesticides causes misery to millions of people, whether through disease or reduced food supply.
 � The global incidence of malaria has almost exploded:
 to an estimated 200 million victims by 1972 and 300 million now.
 Pesticide resistance is an important reason for the increase:
 malaria is caused by a protozoan blood parasite, and humans are infected with it by mosquitoes.
 � Insect pests such as the Colorado potato beetle are very destructive:
 at present they destroy about 20% of world crop production, and it has been estimated that in the absence of effective pesticides as much as 50% would be lost.
 As more pests are sprayed with pesticides, more evolve resistance:
 in 1983, over 400 insect species were resistant to one or more pesticide.
 The list grows longer every year.
 However, the rapid evolution of resistance to pesticides provides a marvellously clear example of evolution by natural selection.
 The image opposite is of the destructive Colarado beetle.
 What are the genetics of pesticide resistance?
 Resistance Definition Definition
 Resistance may be defined as �a heritable change in the sensitivity of a pest population that is reflected in the repeated failure of a product to achieve the expected level of control when used according to the label recommendation for that pest species�.
 Cross-resistance occurs when resistance to one insecticide confers resistance to another insecticide, even where the insect has not been exposed to the latter product.
 Clearly, because pest insect populations are usually large in size and they breed quickly, there is always a risk that insecticide resistance may evolve, especially when insecticides are misused or over-used.
 Background Background
 Following the introduction of synthetic organic insecticides in the 1940�s, such as DDT, it was not long before the first cases of resistance were detected and by 1947, resistance to DDT was confirmed in houseflies.
 Thereafter, with every new insecticide introduction, cyclodienes, organophosphates, carbamates, formamidines, pyrethroids, Bacillus thuringiensis, spinosyns andneonicotinoids, cases of resistance appeared some 2 to 20 years after their introduction in a number of key pest species.
 This phenomenon has been described as the �pesticide treadmill�, and the sequence is familiar.
 As a result of continued applications over time the pest evolves resistance to the insecticide and the resistant strain becomes increasingly difficult to control at the labeled rate and frequency.
 This in turn has often led to more frequent applications of the insecticide.
 The intensity of the resistance and the frequency of insecticide-resistant individuals in the population both increase still further and problems of control continue to worsen as yet more product is applied.
 Eventually users switch to another pesticide if one is available.
 The genetics of the heritable resistance traits and the intensive repeated application of pesticides, together are responsible for the rapid build-up of resistance in most insects and mites.
 Development Development
 Natural selection by an insecticide allows some initially very rare, naturally occurring, pre-adapted insects with resistance genes to survive and pass the resistance trait on to their offspring.
 Through continued application of insecticides with the same MoA, selection for the resistant individuals continues so the proportion of resistant insects in the population increases, while susceptible individuals are eliminated by the insecticide.
 Under permanent selection pressure, resistant insects outnumber susceptible ones and the insecticide is no longer effective.
 The speed with which resistance develops depends on several factors, including how fast the insects reproduce, the migration and host range of the pest, the availability of nearby susceptible populations, the persistence and specificity of the crop protection product, and the rate, timing and number of applications made.
 Resistance increases fastest in situations such as greenhouses, where insects or mites reproduce quickly, there is little or no immigration of susceptible individuals and the user may spray frequently.
 Pesticide Resistance Resistance
 The chemical arsenal we have developed in an attempt to rid our homes of rodents and our crops of insects is losing its power.
 We have simply caused pest populations to evolve, unintentionally applying artificial selection in the form of pesticides.
 Individuals with a higher tolerance for our poisons survive and breed, and soon resistant individuals outnumber the ones we can control.

 Pesticide Resistance:
 It has the menacing sound of an Alfred Hitchcock movie:
 Millions of rats aren't even getting sick from pesticide doses that once killed them.
 In one county in England, these "super rats" have built up such resistance to certain toxins that they can consume five times as much poison as rats in other counties before dying.
 From insect larvae that keep munching on pesticide-laden cotton in the U.S.
 to head lice that won't wash out of children's hair, pests are slowly developing genetic shields that enable them to survive whatever poisons humans give them.
 Rachel Carson predicted such resistance in her groundbreaking book Silent Spring, published soon after the chemical insecticide glory days of the 1950s.
 And the problem is getting worse.
 Farmers in the U.S.
 lost about seven percent of their crops to pests in the 1940s.
 Since the 1980s, some 13 percent of crops are being lost -- and more pesticides are being used.
 It's a huge problem, but the pests are only following the rules of evolution:
 the best-adapted survive.
 Every time chemicals are sprayed on a lawn to kill weeds or ants for example, a few naturally resistant members of the targeted population survive and create a new generation of pests that are poison-resistant.
 That generation breeds another more-resistant generation; eventually, the pesticide may be rendered ineffective or even kill other wildlife or the very grass it was designed to protect.
 In many ways, human actions are hastening pests' evolution of resistance.
 Farmers spray higher doses of pesticide if the traditional dose doesn't kill, so genetic mechanisms that enable the pests to survive the stronger doses rapidly become widespread as the offspring of resistant individuals come to dominate the population.
 These days, farmers and backyard gardeners alike are trying to outsmart the pests by using a variety of natural methods.
 With "integrated pest management," scientists encourage the spread of natural enemies of pests, or they lure the pests with a meal that's even more tasty than the vulnerable crop.
 Pesticides are only used as a last resort if every other method fails.
 Integrated pest management has had some successes, but pesticides are still the world's most popular way to kill pests.
 Something to ponder the next time you can't seem to kill a cockroach.

 Resistance of weeds to herbicides is not a unique phenomenon.
 In fact, resistance to pesticides is a world wide problem that is not confined to any single pest category.
 The first report of insects resistant to insecticides was in 1908, of plant pathogens resistant to fungicides in 1940, and of weeds resistant to herbicides (triazines) in 1968.
 By 1991,120 weed biotypes that were resistant to triazine herbicides and 15 other herbicide families were documented throughout the world.
 Results of a 1992 North Central Weed Science Society survey of the north central United States and Canada reflect a world wide trend of increasing appearance of herbicide resistance.
 Twelve states or provinces reported biotypes of 19 weed species resistant to triazine herbicides (Table 7).
 Five states or provinces reported biotypes of three weed species resistant to lipid biosynthesis inhibitors (Table 4), 10 states or provinces reported biotypes of four weed species resistant to amino acid biosynthesis inhibitors (Table 2), four states or provinces reported biotypes of two weed species resistant to dinitroaniline herbicides (Table 5), and Manitoba reported resistance of a wild mustard biotype to growth regulator herbicides (Table 1).
 Indeed, pests have proven to be ecologically and biochemically adaptable to agrichemicals.
 Why Worry About Herbicide Resistance?
 Back to Table of Contents Contents
 In corn, soybean, and small grains there are many herbicide options.
 Why then should a crop producer be concerned whether a weed biotype is resistant to a particular herbicide?
 There are several reasons.
 Many herbicide options could quickly be lost for several crops if a weed biotype is resistant to more than one herbicide (i.e.
 cross resistance).
 Obviously, a loss of herbicide options could have important economic and environmental consequences to agriculture.
 Also, in an era of high re-registration costs for older herbicides and high development costs for new herbicides, the possibility for replacement of the herbicides lost due to resistance diminishes.
 Finally, in most cases, it will not be easy nor inexpensive to assess resistant weed biotypes.
 Due to cross resistance, many resistance problems may have to be solved by trial and error, which could be quite expensive to the crop producer.
 The herbicide resistance issue does have solutions and perhaps the best place to start is to consider herbicides as a resource that needs to be preserved.
 Strategies for resistance prevention follow from there.
 Definitions Definitions
 Back to Table of Contents Contents
 Site of action refers to the biochemical site within the plant with which the herbicide directly interacts.
 Some herbicide site of action interactions are well understood, others are unknown.
 Many of the well-known sites of action are enzymes or proteins essential to plant growth and development (Figure 1 and Figure 2).
 Also, some herbicides are believed to act at multiple sites.
 Metabolism refers to the biochemical processes within the plant that generally modify herbicides to less toxic compounds.
 Differential rates of metabolism between crops and weeds is a primary method of crop selectivity to herbicides.
 One metabolic process may affect several different families of herbicides.
 Herbicide families are a convenient way of organizing herbicides that share a common chemical structure and have similar herbicidal activity.
 Two or more herbicide families may affect the same site of action and therefore express similar herbicidal activity and injury symptoms.
 For information about the site of action and chemical family of a specific herbicide, please refer to Herbicide Mode of Action and Injury Symptoms CD-ROM.
 A biotype is a group of plants within a species that has biological traits that are not common to the population as a whole.
 For example, the Pursuit resistant corn hybrid Pioneer 3377 IR is a biotype of Pioneer 3377 and atrazine-resistant common lambsquarters is a biotype of common lambsquarters.
 Therefore, in most instances, specific biotypes are not easily recognizable by casual observation.
 Selection intensity in regard to herbicide resistance is the degree to which weed control measures (e.g.
 herbicides) in a cropping system give a competitive advantage to a weed or crop biotype resistant to a particular herbicide.
 Herbicide susceptibility means a particular weed or crop biotype is killed by the recommended use rate of the herbicide.
 Herbicide resistance refers to the inherited ability of a weed or crop biotype to survive a herbicide application to which the original population was susceptible.
 Currently, the three known resistance mechanisms that plants employ are:
 an alteration of the herbicide site of action, metabolism of the herbicide, and removal of the herbicide from the target site (sequestration).
 Herbicide cross resistance refers to a weed or crop biotype that has evolved a mechanism or mechanisms of resistance to one herbicide that also allows it to be resistant to other herbicides.
 Cross resistance can occur with herbicides within the same or in different herbicide families and with the same or different sites of action.
 For example, after the extensive use of herbicide A in a field, selection of a weed biotype resistant to herbicide A is found to also be resistant to herbicide B, although herbicide B was never used in that field.
 Herbicide multiple resistance refers to a weed or crop biotype that has evolved mechanisms of resistance to more than one herbicide and the resistance was brought about by separate selection processes.
 For example, after a weed or crop biotype developed resistance to herbicide A, then herbicide B was used and resistance evolved to herbicide B.
 The plant is now resistant to herbicides A and B through two separate selection processes.
 How Does Selection of Resistant Weed Biotypes Occur?
 Back to Table of Contents Contents
 Selection for change in weed populations begins when a small number of plants (a biotype) within a weed species have a genetic makeup that enables them to survive a particular herbicide application.
 Where this difference in genetic makeup originated is not clear.
 However, herbicides are not known to directly cause the genetic change (i.e.
 mutation) that allows resistance.
 The resistant biotype, therefore, is present in low numbers in natural populations and when a herbicide is applied, most of the susceptible weeds die but the few resistant weeds survive, mature, and produce seed.
 If the same herbicide continues to be applied and the resistant weeds reproduce, the percentage of the weed population that is resistant will increase (Figure 3).
 It is difficult to predict exactly which weed species will have biotypes resistant to a given herbicide.
 However, we have learned from previous pesticide resistance problems that the occurrence of herbicide resistant weeds is linked directly to the herbicide program used, the weed species present, and the crop management practices employed.
 Selection Intensity � The Key to Prevention Prevention
 Back to Table of Contents Contents
 Selection intensity acts, in a sense, like a filter that can screen out susceptible weed biotypes while leaving resistant biotypes.
 Herbicides by definition are effective weed killers; therefore, they have the potential to exert heavy selection intensity on weeds.
 The more susceptible a weed species is to a given herbicide (i.e.
 the greater the weed control) the greater the selection intensity.
 As a result, the rate of selection for resistance can be quite rapid if the same herbicide or herbicides with the same site of action are repeatedly used in a particular field.
 With such highly effective herbicides, one would think that the increase in the number of herbicide resistant biotypes would be readily observable.
 This is not the case.
 Resistant biotypes generally are only detectable when they make up about 30% of the population.
 During the first several years of a weed control program that relies on only one herbicide, the proportion of resistant biotypes is very low (less than 1% of the population).
 As long as the application of this herbicide continues and the resistant biotypes reproduce, the proportion of the population that is resistant will increase.
 It is very common to go from excellent control of a particular weed species to very poor control within one growing season.
 A gradual decline in performance is seldom seen.
 Figure 4 illustrates the predicted rapid increase in the proportion of a kochia population that is resistant following repeated annual applications of the sulfonylurea herbicide Glean.
 In field situations, resistance to sulfonylurea herbicides has been reported to occur after 3 to 5 years of repeated use.
 With triazine herbicides, resistance has generally appeared after seven or more years of repeated use.
 Therefore, depending upon the proportion of the population that was initially resistant to a herbicide, repeated use of a product for more than two years could develop a herbicide resistance problem.
 Herbicide Factors that Increase Selection Intensity Intensity
 Back to Table of Contents Contents
 The herbicide characteristics that affect herbicide resistance are as follows:
 1.Herbicides that act on a single site of action.
 2.Herbicides that are applied multiple times during the growing season.
 3.Herbicides used for several consecutive growing seasons or repeated application of herbicides with the same site of action to the same or different crops.
 4.Herbicides used without other weed control options (e.g.
 cultivation) and are considered "stand alone" weed control programs.
 Single Site of Action Herbicides Herbicides
 Several herbicide families interfere with only a single site of action.
 Tables 2 - 5 and 7 - 9 list the herbicides associated with specific sites of action.
 Herbicides that interfere with single sites of action are generally more likely to select for resistant weeds because a change in only one gene may be enough to affect a herbicide's binding potential to the site of action.
 Therefore, it is more probable that a resistant weed population will develop if a difference of only one gene is required (Figure 5).
 Multiple Site of Action Herbicides Herbicides
 Based on the line of reasoning presented for single site of action herbicides, if a herbicide has multiple action sites it is less likely existing biotypes will have the genetic differences at all of the sites of action that will result in resistance (Figure 5).
 Therefore, it is less likely that weeds will evolve resistance to herbicides with multiple action sites.
 Tables 1 and 6 list herbicides with multiple sites of action.
 Herbicide Cross Resistance and Site of Action Action
 A change in a site of action that results in resistance to a particular herbicide may or may not result in resistance to other herbicides that are active at the same site of action.
 The reason for this is there can be many different binding sites at a particular site of action (e.g.
 an enzyme) and those binding sites can be very herbicide specific.
 Therefore, several different herbicides may bind to the same enzyme but at different sites on the enzyme (Figure 6).
 As a result, it is not possible to predict herbicide cross resistance; however, the greatest potential for herbicide cross resistance exists among herbicides of the same family and having the same site of action.
 To illustrate cross resistance, both the imidazolinone (e.g.
 Pursuit and Scepter) and sulfonylurea (e.g.
 Classic) herbicide families are ALS enzyme inhibitors (Table 2).
 However, imidazolinone resistant (IR) corn hybrids are resistant to imidazolinone herbicides and are cross resistant to the sulfonylurea herbicides.
 The imidazolinone tolerant (IT) corn hybrids are resistant to Pursuit and soil-applied Scepter but are not cross resistant to sulfonylurea herbicides.
 Herbicide Resistance via Altered Metabolism Metabolism
 Regardless of whether a herbicide is active at single or multiple site(s) of action, it is often metabolized by crops or weeds before reaching the primary site(s) of action.
 Therefore, the rate at which a herbicide is metabolized plays a key role in determining crop injury and weed control.
 The genetic regulation of a metabolic process will influence the likelihood of developing herbicide resistance due to altered metabolism.
 For example, a change in only one gene has altered the rate of metabolism of atrazine in some biotypes of atrazine-resistant velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti).
 Most metabolic processes are thought to be controlled by multiple genes, thereby reducing the probability but not eliminating the possibility of weed biotypes that are resistant to herbicides due to enhanced metabolic capabilities or altered metabolic processes.
 Metabolic resistance could be especially challenging if it were to occur, because a metabolic process often affects several families of herbicides that do not share a common site of action.
 Regardless of the resistance mechanism, the key to prevention of herbicide resistance is to reduce the selection intensity.
 Weed Characteristics that Favor Resistance Resistance
 Back to Table of Contents Contents
 Weeds, by their nature, have a diverse genetic background that gives them the ability to adapt to many different environments.
 For example, the repeated mowing of a lawn selects for low growing plants that avoid or are not affected by repeated cutting.
 Therefore, it should not be surprising that weeds can adapt to certain herbicide programs.
 Weeds with a diverse genetic background may have a resistant biotype that has a 1 in 1 million chance of occurring within a weed population.
 Although these odds sound remote, a 1 in 1 million chance of occurrence can translate into a high probability of selecting for a herbicide resistant weed biotype unless proper methods to reduce selection intensity are used.
 As a herbicide resistant biotype becomes more predominant in the weed population, two factors increase in importance:
 1.Weed reproductive capability.
 2.Weed seed dispersal mechanisms.
 The greater the reproductive success of the resistant biotype, the greater its potential to spread and become a dominant part of the population.
 Due to the extended viability of most weed seeds, once established, a herbicide resistant biotype will be difficult to eliminate from the population, even if extensive remedial weed control measures are used.
 Weeds such as kochia can tumble for miles spreading seed onto previously uninfested land.
 As a result of the diverse seed dispersal mechanisms of weeds, it is apparent that a farm manager must always use good herbicide resistance management strategies to prevent resistant biotypes from developing on the land and prohibit the establishment of resistant weed biotypes spreading from adjacent lands or from custom harvesting equipment and other machinery.
 Diagnosing Herbicide Resistant Weeds Weeds
 Back to Table of Contents Contents
 Before assuming that any weeds surviving a herbicide application are resistant, rule out other factors that might have affected herbicide performance.
 Several factors would be misapplication, unfavorable weather conditions, improper timing of herbicide application, and weed flushes after application of a non-residual herbicide.
 If resistance appears to be a likely possibility, check for the following:
 1.Are other weeds listed on the product label controlled satisfactorily?
 Chances are only one weed species will show herbicide resistance in any given field situation.
 Therefore, if several normally susceptible weed species are present, reconsider factors other than herbicide resistance as the cause of the lack of weed control.
 2.Did the same herbicide or herbicide with the same site of action fail in the same area of the field in the previous year?
 3.Do field histories indicate extensive use of the same herbicide or herbicide site of action year after year?
 If one or more of these three situations apply, it is possible that the weeds are resistant to the herbicide.
 If resistance is suspected, control the weeds with a labeled herbicide having another site of action or use appropriate nonchemical weed control methods to prevent the weeds from going to seed.
 Next, contact your local crop consultant or extension agent, state weed specialist, and the appropriate chemical company to develop a comprehensive weed control program to manage the problem.
 Herbicide Resistant Crops Crops
 Back to Table of Contents Contents
 Recent research efforts have been directed at breeding herbicide resistance into crops.
 For minor-use crops it may be more economical to breed herbicide resistance into a crop than to develop new selective herbicides for current crop varieties.
 For major-use crops such as corn, soybeans, and wheat, herbicide resistant crops may be useful where difficult to control weeds or environmental conditions dictate the use of specific herbicides to which the crop is normally susceptible.
 The use of herbicide resistant crops could enhance the potential for selecting for herbicide resistant weeds unless careful management practices are followed.
 The key, once again, is selection intensity.
 Misuse of herbicide resistant crops could encourage the use of a single herbicide or herbicide family over several crop rotations, thereby enhancing the selection intensity for herbicide resistant weeds.
 Herbicide resistant crop varieties or hybrids need to be carefully evaluated for other performance characteristics (e.g.
 yield) and these characteristics should be compared to all other suitable hybrids or varieties in the marketplace, whether they have herbicide resistance or not.
 This will ensure that crop producers are getting the best overall agronomic value for their money.
 It will also be very important that accurate records be kept of the exact planting location of the herbicide resistant crops to avoid herbicide misapplication.
 Management Strategies for Avoiding and Managing Herbicide Resistant Weeds Weeds
 Back to Table of Contents Contents
 The North Central Weed Science Society (NCWSS) Herbicide Resistance Committee has developed the following list of strategies for avoiding and managing problems with herbicide resistant weed biotypes.
 Keep in mind that reliance upon any one strategy is not likely to be effective.
 The crop producer must use the following strategies in carefully selected combinations if herbicide resistant weed problems are to be avoided or properly managed.
 1.Use herbicides only when necessary.
 Where available, herbicide applications should be based on economic thresholds.
 Continued development of effective economic threshold models should be helpful.
 2.Rotate herbicides (sites of action).
 Do not make more than two consecutive applications of herbicides with the same site of action to the same field unless other effective control practices are also included in the management system.
 Two consecutive applications could be single annual applications for two years, or two split applications in one year.
 3.Apply herbicides in tank-mixed, prepackaged, or sequential mixtures that include multiple sites of action.
 Both herbicides, however, must have substantial activity against potentially resistant weeds for this strategy to be effective.
 Remember that in the past, weeds that were selected for herbicide resistance often were not the primary target species.
 It may be expensive to apply herbicide combinations that duplicate a wide spectrum of weed control activity.
 Many of the more economical herbicide combinations may not be adequate.
 Table 10 is a cross reference list of package mixtures and their corresponding sites of action.
 4.Rotate crops, particularly those with different life cycles (e.g.
 winter annuals such as winter wheat, perennials such as alfalfa, summer annuals such as corn or soybeans).
 At the same time, remember not to use herbicides with the same site of action in these different crops against the same weed unless other effective control practices are also included in the management system.
 5.Planting new herbicide resistant crop varieties should not result in more than two consecutive applications of herbicides with the same site of action against the same weed unless other effective control practices are also included in the management system.
 6.Combine, where feasible, mechanical weed control practices such as rotary hoeing and cultivation with herbicide treatments.
 7.Include, where soil erosion potential is minimal, primary tillage as a component of the weed management program.
 8.Scout fields regularly and identify weeds present.
 Respond quickly to changes in weed populations to restrict spread of weeds that may have been selected for resistance.
 9.Clean tillage and harvest equipment before moving from fields infested with resistant weeds to those that are not.
 10.Encourage railroads, public utilities, highway departments and similar organizations that use total vegetation control programs should be encouraged to use vegetation management systems that do not lead to selection of herbicide resistant weeds.
 Resistant weeds from total vegetation control areas frequently spread to cropland.
 Chemical companies, state and federal agencies, and farm organizations can all help in this effort.

 Bedbug Genetic Study Finds Possible Pesticide-Resistance Genes Genes
 ScienceDaily (Jan.
 19, 2011) � Ohio State University entomologists have conducted the first genetic study of bedbugs, paving the road to the identification of potential genes associated with pesticide resistance and possible new control methods for the troublesome insect, whose sudden resurgence in the United States has led to a public health scare.

 The discovery was reported Jan.

 "While bedbugs are poised to become one of the major household pests across the United States in the coming years, we know very little about their genetic makeup and their mechanisms of resistance to insecticides," said Omprakash Mittapalli, corresponding author of the study and an assistant professor of entomology with the university's Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center in Wooster.
 "This is the first study to elucidate the genetic make up of the insect and to obtain fundamental molecular knowledge regarding potential defense pathways and genes that may be involved in metabolic resistance to commonly used pesticides." pesticides."
 A minor nuisance since World War II as a result of the widespread use of DDT and other long-lasting residual insecticides, bedbug (Cimex lectularius) numbers have increased in the past decade as much as 500 percent in North America and other parts of the world -- costing billions of dollars to homeowners and businesses annually and requiring the use of large quantities of pesticides, many of them ineffective.
 Reasons behind the spike in bedbug infestations include a boom in international travel, increased exchange of used furniture, a shift from powerful but dangerous insecticides such as DDT to more selective control tactics, and the development of resistance among bedbug populations to currently used pesticides -- pyrethroids in particular.
 "The common assumption today is that pesticide resistance in bedbugs results from point mutations in certain genes," Mittapalli explained.
 "However, the role of detoxification and antioxidant enzymes in pesticide resistance of bedbugs is poorly understood.
 Enzymes such as Cytochrome P450s and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) have been shown in other insects to act as detoxification agents, allowing the insects to get rid of toxic compounds such as insecticides and not be killed by them.
 Our study looked closely at those groups of enzymes in bedbugs." bedbugs."
 For the study, Mittapalli and his team employed 454 sequencing technology, which has recently enabled the application of functional genomics to a broad range of insect species previously unexplored at the molecular level.
 They analyzed both laboratory-reared bedbugs susceptible to insecticides (the Harlan strain) and pesticide-exposed bedbugs collected from a Columbus, Ohio apartment in 2009 and 2010.
 This analysis led to the identification of 35,646 expressed sequence tags, or ESTs, which are instrumental in gene discovery and sequencing work.
 Before this study was conducted, less than 2,000 ESTs for C.
 lectularius had been filed in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases.
 This information alone is expected to advance additional genetic studies of bedbugs and comparative molecular analyses of blood-feeding insects.
 "From the database we created, we profiled the transcript level for a cytochrome P450 (CYP9) and a GST (Delta-epsilon) in different developmental stages (early-stage nymphs, late-stage nymphs and adults) of pesticide-susceptible and pesticide-exposed bedbugs," Mittapalli said.
 "We found higher transcript levels for CYP9 in all developmental stages in pesticide-exposed populations compared to pesticide-susceptible populations.
 We also found higher transcript levels of Delta-epsilon in the late-instar nymphs of pesticide-exposed bedbug populations." populations."
 Further studies -- including gene silencing, or "knocking down," the CYP9 and Delta-epsilon candidate genes to confirm that they are indeed involved in pesticide resistance -- are still needed.
 "The insecticides being used right now are based on the idea that resistance in bedbugs is caused by point mutations in genes," Mittapalli pointed out.
 "But we are finding out that the mode of resistance could be attributed to a combination of changes in the bug's genetic makeup (such as mutations) as well as transcriptomic adjustments leading to differential gene expression.
 Pinpointing such defense mechanisms and the associated genes could lead to the development of novel methods of control that are more effective." effective."
 Bedbugs collected from an infested Ohio apartment are providing genetic details about why the pests are so pesky, a finding that could lead to more robust weapons to defeat the blood-sucking insects once and for all.
 After several decades of remaining under the radar, bedbugs (Cimex lectularius) have taken off in North America and other parts of the world, with their numbers growing up to 500 percent over the past decade.
 Many cities are under siege by these tiny insects, which cause itching and rashes and are devilishly difficult to get rid of.
 That's because the bugs have developed resistance (an ability to fight off toxins that would usually kill them) to most of the common insecticides used by pest control technicians worldwide.
 Despite their worldwide recurrence, very little is known about this common household pest, according to Ohio State University researchers Omprakash Mittapalli and Susan Jones.
 Their new work reveals possible genes that relay pesticide resistance and also ways in which bedbugs stand out from other, less pesky, insects.
 "This is really the first effort to get into the genomics of the bedbug and to understand how it's similar and different than other insects," Coby Schal, an urban etymologist at North Carolina State University who wasn't involved in the study, told LiveScience."It's definitely a big step forward." forward."
 Inside the bedbug genome genome
 The duo analyzed the genomes of the bedbug to look for answers.
 They examined a DNA intermediary called RNA, which makes proteins (the substances that carry out a gene's instructions).
 They also looked at how many copies of this RNA the bedbugs had for certain genes, which can influence the amount of protein made.
 They identified 35,000 genes, more than 17 times the number of genes known.
 They also compared the genes with those of other pests, finding that bedbugs are closely related to lice and aphids, though about 44 percent of the genes they found were unique to the bedbug.
 Some of these unique genes might be involved in resistance, but the researchers won't know until the genes are studied further.
 What they did find were differences in gene expression (meaning the production of proteins) between a normal lab strain of bedbugs, which had never been exposed to insecticides, and a pesticide-resistant strain that Jones collected from an infested apartment in Ohio.
 The gene in question belongs to the p450 family of genes that detoxify things that organisms (from animals and plants to bacteria and fungi) ingest, specifically the CPY9 genes.
 The pesticide-resistant bedbugs had much higher expression levels, leading researchers to think that it might be one mechanism of resistance.
 "It's a really good candidate," Mittipalli told LiveScience.
 "It's come out to be one of the best targets so far." far."
 The complex story of resistance resistance
 Bedbugs actually have many ways to become resistant to pesticides.
 They can modify other detoxifying genes; they can grow a less permeable outer skin (to physically block out the toxic chemicals); or they can modify other proteins.
 The expression pattern of the CYP9 gene hints that it might be involved in at least some cases of pesticide resistance.
 Pesticides that are detoxified by this protein should be avoided, Schal said.
 "The take-home message is that it is much more complex than we thought, and that it's a combination of genetic changes in the bedbug genome plus differential gene expression," Mittipalli said."It can be a lot more complicated." complicated."
 Additional bedbug populations need to be studied, to see if these expression patterns hold across other resistant and non-resistant strains, though it's likely they will, Schal said.
 Mittapalli's group is working on follow-up studies to determine how important this gene is to pesticide resistance, and is searching for other resistance genes.
 Introduction to pesticide resistance management management
 What is pesticide resistance?
 Among the billions of individuals that make up a pest population (be it disease, insect, mite, weed etc), there may exist some individuals that are less susceptible a pesticide than others.
 If the same pesticide is continually applied, then the more susceptible individuals will be killed, leaving only resistant individuals to breed and multiply.
 If the resistance is heritable then eventually a large proportion of the population may be resistant to the pesticide.
 The resistant pests may then cause unacceptable damage to crops.
 Therefore, pesticide resistance or, more accurately, the resistance of pests to pesticides occurs where the pest population has changed genetically so that it is less susceptible or sensitive to a pesticide or class of pesticides.
 This means that a higher dose of pesticide is now required to control the pest population, or even that the highest practical dose will not kill all pest individuals.
 Types of resistance resistance
 There are two types of resistance (or susceptibility) to pesticides:
 1.the normal variability in the susceptibility of individuals of a population to a chemical control, and and
 2.changes in the overall susceptibility of pest population in response to exposure to a chemical.
 Here, we are concerned with the latter, in which pesticides fail due to genetic change in the pest population, rather than changes in the crop plant or chemical.
 Reasons for control failure failure
 Not all instances of control failure are due to the development of pesticide resistance in the target pest population.
 Other reasons for failure may include:
 �poor spray application due to operator error and poor sprayer calibration; calibration;
 �unsuitable weather during or immediately after spraying such as excessive wind or rain washing off the pesticide; pesticide;
 �faulty product; product;
 �inappropriate product.
 Poor control may allow the more resistant pest individuals to survive, and continual use of the same control may then allow true pesticide resistance to develop.
 Resistance management strategies strategies
 One of the objectives of the New Zealand Plant Protection Society is to pool and exchange information on the biology of weeds, invertebrate and vertebrate pests, pathogens and beneficial organisms and methods for modifying their effects.
 The Society has prepared a series of web pages to outline existing problems with pesticide resistance in New Zealand and to suggest strategies for preventing and managing pesticide resistance problems.
 These New Zealand pesticide resistance strategies are divided into sections on managing:
 �herbicide resistance resistance
 �insecticide resistance resistance
 �fungicide resistance resistance
 Each pesticide resistance strategy is also included in the book Pesticide Resistance:
 Prevention and Management Strategies 2005 which is available for purchase from the NZPPS.
 How do insects become resistant to pesticide?
 Insects are known for their ability to develop resistance to insecticides.
 Currently there are insects resistant to every synthetic chemical insecticide used.
 There are many factors to developing resistance.
 In a population of insects there may be a few individuals that carry the genes for resistance.
 These genes arise from mutations and are rare.
 In the natural environment the mutant insect is typically compromised, weaker and produces less progenies.
 Upon exposure to insecticides, insects that do not carry the resistance genes die, thus allowing the individuals with the resistance genes to survive and reproduce, creating more resistant insects.
 With every generation the number of resistant insects increase.
 Bt is a form of natural pesticide, as with any kind of pesticide the problem of resistance is almost unavoidable.
 Precaution must be taken and research must be done to understand and help prevent resistance with Bt.
 Minimize Resistance Resistance
 (Bt spray) spray)
 There are some steps Bt users apply to minimize resistance.
 Currently in the field, the diamondback moth is the only insect found to have developed resistance against Bt.
 The diamondback larvae feed on all plants in the mustard family, including canola, mustard, broccoli, and cabbage.
 The diamondback moth larvae is resistance to proteins made by the Bt strain kurstaki.
 In the laboratory, scientists have found many species of insects to be resistant to Bt.
 These insects are currently studied to further our understanding of Bt resistance and prevention.
 Farmers that use Bt are required by the EPA to take steps to help prevent further resistance by other insects.
 Some alternate Bt applications with synthetic insecticides so that any resistance to any one class of insecticide does not develop.
 Crop rotation is also another method used to help combat resistance.
 Since different crops are attacked by different insect pests, different types of Bt will be used.
 By rotating crops, the pressure of one specific strain of Bt on an insect is minimized.
 The pest insect has less time to develop resistance before a new strain is used for a different insect.
 (Bt Transgenic Crop) Crop)
 Farmers that use transgenic crops have to follow resistance management requirements set by the EPA.
 Refuge planting is a big part of resistance management in transgenic farming.
 (CBS) Malaria experts are worried in the wake of an ominous new study from Senegal showing that the mosquitoes that spread the deadly disease can develop resistance to insecticide-treated nets.
 Researchers studied malaria infections in a village in the West African nation and found that the disease may be rebounding because the insects are becoming resistant to the increasingly resistant to the insecticide deltamethrin.
 Despite decades of efforts to beat malaria with insecticides, indoor spraying, bednets, and drugs, the disease kills nearly 800,000 people a year, Reuters reported.
 Most of the victims are babies and young children in sub-Saharan Africa.
 In recent years, the nets have been widely distributed in Africa, and the World Health Organization says that when properly deployed they can cut malaria rates by half, the BBC reported.
 But will the nets lose their effectiveness if mosquitoes are resistant to the pesticide used to treat them?
 To find out, researchers looked at malaria cases in the Senegalese village of Dielmo before and after the bednets were distributed there.
 During the two years from August 2008 to August 2010 after bednets were distributed, there was a sharp drop in malaria attacks, according to Reuters.
 But between September and December 2010 - 27 to 30 months after the nets had been given out - malaria attacks in adults and older children rose to even higher levels than before.
 The rise in cases seemed to mirror the increasing proportions of malaria-carrying mosquitoes resistant to deltamethrin.
 What does it all mean?
 "Strategies to address the problem of insecticide resistance and to mitigate its effects must be urgently defined and implemented," concluded the authors of the study, which was published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.
 Although pesticides are designed to kill pest populations, they are seldom 100% effective -- a few individuals usually survive and reproduce.
 These survivors may have a behavioral trait that helps them avoid the pesticide, a biochemical trait that allows them to detoxify the pesticide, pesticide,
 or some other genetic characteristic that reduces their susceptiblity to the pesticide.
 If these survivors mate and pass on this "resistance" to their offspring, then subsequent generations will contain fewer susceptible individuals.
 Eventually, the entire population may become "resistant".
 There are two major variables that determine the rate at which a resistant trait is likely to spread throughout the population:
 Its mechanism of inheritance (dominant, recessive, or co-dominant; sex linked, pleiotropic, or polygenic), and and
 The severity of selective pressure (what percentage of susceptible individuals survive each generation and whether mortality occurs before or after the susceptible individuals reproduce).
 In general, resistance will spread through a population most rapidly when it is inherited as a single, dominant allele and selective pressure is high (meaning very few susceptible individuals escape and reproduce).
 Class Resistance and Cross Resistance Resistance
 When an insect population develops resistance to one pesticide, it may also prove to be resistant to similar compounds that have the same mode of action.
 This phenomenon, known as class resistance, occurs frequently in pest populations that develop resistance to organophosphate, carbamate, or pyrethroid insecticides.
 In some cases, a population may develop a form of resistance that protects it from compounds in more than one chemical class.
 This cross resistance may produce a population that can no longer be controlled with chemical insecticides.
 Resistance Management Management
 Frequent and/or indiscriminant use of chemical insecticides typically leads to the development of resistance and to a need for more powerful poisons.
 But wise use of pesticides can delay (or maybe even prevent) the evolution of resistant genotypes.
 There are basically three strategies that can be used to "manage" the resistance problem:
 1.
 Management by Saturation involves excessive, heavy, or frequent use of a pesticide that is designed to leave absolutely no survivors.
 This strategy overwhelms a population's resistance, suppresses any detoxification mechanism, and precludes reproduction by survivors.
 It is most effective when the resistant gene is dominant and the target population is small, isolated, or living in a limited habitat (e.g.
 greenhouse).
 2.
 Management by Moderation uses only the minimum control necessary to reduce a population below its economic threshold.
 Growers use low rates, short-residual compounds, infrequent applications, and/or incomplete coverage to ensure that significant numbers of susceptible individuals survive and reproduce.
 This strategy tries to ensure that susceptible genes are never eliminated from the population.
 It works best when the susceptible trait is dominant over the resistant trait.
 3.
 Management by Multiple Attack involves the use of several control tactics that work in different ways.
 By rotating insecticides with different modes-of-action or by alternating chemical with non-chemical control tactics, a pest population is exposed to selective pressures that change from generation to generation.
 Natural selection for a resistant genotype is less likely to occur when selective pressures are highly variable.
 Managing Pesticide Resistance Resistance
 -- Timothy J.
 Dennehy and John Dunley Dunley
 (originally published 1993) 1993)
 Though it has been over 80 years since the first discovery of a major agricultural pest becoming resistant to a pesticide, it was not until the 1950s that most growers became familiar with pesticide resistance as a result of the widespread development of insect resistance to DDT.
 Since then, growers have come to expect the eventual loss of pesticide effectiveness because of resistance.
 By the mid-1980s, there were records of about 450 resistant species of insects and mites.
 What is resistance to pesticides?
 It is essential to distinguish between two common but very different contexts in which the word "resistance" is used.
 Specifically, it is important to understand how resistance is defined in the scientific context versus how it is manifest in the field.
 Resistance as defined in the laboratory laboratory
 Resistance, from the scientific perspective, is a heritable, statistically defined decrease in sensitivity to a chemical in a pest population relative to the response of susceptible populations that have never been exposed to pesticides.
 Resistance can be demonstrated by comparing, in laboratory tests, differences in susceptibility between a susceptible population and a population that can withstand to some degree the effects of a pesticide.
 Evidence of resistance in the laboratory does not necessarily mean that a chemical will fail in the field.
 Pesticide effectiveness is influenced by several factors, and resistant pests may or may not be adequately controlled by the insecticide given a set of treatment conditions (rate, volume, coverage, etc.).
 However, the fact remains that resistant pests can be demonstrated to defeat the toxic action of a pesticide to a greater degree than susceptible pests.
 Resistance as manifested in the field field
 Resistance that is manifest in the field results in measurable reductions in the relative efficacy of a pesticide.
 Estimating the impact of this reduction of control is an important step in managing resistance.
 To do this, conventional spray trials are replicated, with the same application equipment and conditions used by growers, at field locations with different levels of resistance.
 When resistance reduces the relative efficacy of a pesticide, the chemical will provide significantly less control of the pest at locations with higher frequencies of resistance than at locations with lower frequencies or no resistance.
 Because field trials usually do not reveal the development of resistance in its early stages, by the time field personnel notice that pesticide performance is declining, resistance often has built up to fairly high frequencies in populations.
 It is for this reason that information from laboratory tests, rather than field experience, must be used for early detection of resistance.
 Loss of relative efficacy of a chemical is not necessarily proof of resistance.
 For example, some instances of poor pesticide performance, initially attributed to pest resistance, have proved to be caused by a breakdown of the pesticide by soil microorganisms or high pH of spray water or by poor pesticide application procedures.
 Mechanisms of resistance resistance
 There are two common mechanisms by which insects and mites overcome the toxic action of pesticides, increased metabolic detoxication and decreased target site sensitivity.
 Resistant pests with enhanced metabolic detoxication are able to disarm toxic pesticide molecules more rapidly than susceptible individuals.
 As a result, less of the active pesticide sprayed on the field reaches the target site in the pest.
 With the second common mechanism, decreased target site sensitivity, the physiological target for the pesticide in the resistant insect is less sensitive to poisoning than in susceptible individuals.
 For example, organophosphate insecticides kill pests by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that is important in nerve function.
 Some insects, mites, and ticks resistant to organophosphates have a form of the target enzyme that is less sensitive to poisoning.
 Resistance also can be enhanced by reduced cuticular penetration of the pesticide, though this appears to be a less common mechanism than those above.
 Reduced penetration alone generally results in only low intensities of resistance, but when combined with increased metabolic detoxication or decreased target site sensitivity it can result in very intense resistances.
 A little-studied but potentially important resistance mechanism involves changes in pests' behavior.
 It is likely that some behavioral resistances enable pests to reduce contact with pesticides on treated plants.
 How Resistance Develops Develops
 Resistance develops via the process of selection by a chemical on the genetic variation in susceptibility within a pest population.
 How selection happens is easy to understand.
 At first, only a very small proportion of a pest population can survive exposure to the pesticide, but each time the pesticide is applied, a greater proportion of resistant individuals survive than susceptible types.
 These resistant individuals pass the genes for pesticide resistance to their progeny.
 Each use of the pesticide increases the proportion of the less-susceptible individuals in the population.
 The degree to which resistance reduces the relative efficacy of a pesticide depends on both the frequency and the intensity of the resistance.
 Frequency refers to the proportion of the pest population that is resistant ; intensity is the strength of the resistance in each resistant pest.
 Obviously, resistance is more likely to become a problem as the frequency of resistant individuals increases in a population.
 But the intensity of a resistance can also affect the pesticide�s efficacy in the field.
 In some cases, control of the resistant pest is only slightly affected by resistance.
 In other cases, the pest becomes virtually immune to the pesticide.
 A pest population may have a resistance of low intensity at a high frequency (proportion of the population) without significantly affecting field performance of the pesticide.
 On the other hand, a very intense resistance might reduce the efficacy of a chemical, even when present a low frequencies in a pest population.
 Cross resistance and multiple resistance resistance
 In nearly half the recorded cases of resistant insects and mites, the pests are resistant to between two and five different classes of chemicals.
 Pests that are resistant to many pesticides pose an especially difficult problem when chemical control is required.
 Understanding the distinction between multiple resistance and cross resistance is important in order to grasp the practical ramifications of pests having more than one resistance factor.
 Cross resistance resistance
 Many resistances are conferred by a single major genetic factor that differs between resistant and susceptible pests.
 When a single factor confers resistance to more than one pesticide, this is cross resistance.
 For example, a mechanism making insects resistant to parathion also dramatically reduces susceptibility to a number of other organophosphates.
 Therefore, when parathion becomes ineffective due to resistance, some other organophosphates also lose efficacy because of cross resistance.
  Cross resistance is a type of pesticides, e.g.
 organophosphates and carbamates, would be less effective where resistance occurs to either.
 Multiple resistance resistance
 With multiple resistances, two resistance mechanisms are acquired independently through exposure to two different pesticides.
 For example, some spider mites possess resistance to cyhexatin (Plictran) and dicofol (Kelthane).
 However, these resistances are acquired by two separate genetic modifications, and resistance of the pest to one product does not affect susceptibility to the other.
 When a pest is resistant to two pesticides the only way to find out if it is due to cross resistance or multiple resistance is by conducting genetic studies in the laboratory.
 Resistance stability stability
 Resistances can be either stable or unstable in the field, depending upon many factors involving the pest, the chemical, and the agricultural system used.
 A stable resistance increases in frequency when a pesticide is used and does not decline appreciably thereafter.
 An unstable resistance similarly increases in response to pesticide treatments but decreases in frequency during intervals when the pesticide is no longer used.
 The phenomenon of unstable resistance can be exploited to manage resistance.
 Under a given set of circumstances, research can be conducted to estimate the length of time needed for the frequency of resistant pests to be reset, i.e., to decline to levels existing before the last treatment was applied.
 Then a resistance management program can be developed that employs pesticide rotations that allow for this resetting of resistance.
 The shortest interval in which the same chemical can be used and still allow resistance frequencies to reset is called the minimum reset interval.
 If treatments are spaced at less than the reset interval, the resistance increases in a stair-step fashion, but if the interval between treatments is as long or longer than the reset interval, there will be no net increase in resistance resistance
 Reset intervals will vary between crops and geographic locations.
 Once an appropriate reset interval has been established for a system, appropriately selected pesticides can be used in rotation to maintain their efficacy and resistance can be monitored to evaluate the success of the program.
 Factors influencing resistance resistance
 Researchers have shown that resistance development in pest populations is influenced by many biological, ecological, genetic, and operational factors.
 Biological and ecological factors include:
 �Characteristics of the pest, such as the rate of reproduction, the number of generations per year and mobility of the species.
 �Characteristics of the orchard, such as proximity to untreated areas, suitability of alternate hosts for pest development, immigration of susceptible pests and effectiveness of biological control.
 Genetic factors include:
 �The number of genes conferring resistance.
 �The frequency and intensity of resistance genes in the population.
 �The ability of resistant individuals to grow and reproduce relative to susceptible pests.
 Operational factors include:
 �Characteristics of the chemical.
 �Treatment thresholds.
 �Application methodology and equipment.
 �Chemical use strategies such as chemical rotations or mixtures.
 In practice, many of these factors are not readily manipulated by growers.
 From the practical standpoint, growers wishing to manage resistance should give attention to the following factors:
 �How effectively you employ methods of integrated pest management.
 �How often you use pesticides.
 �How you select and apply the pesticides you use.
 Growers who use pesticides the least have the most effective resistance management programs.
 Resistance cannot be managed in situations where a pesticide is used many times each season.
 Chemical use strategies for resistance management management
 Since selection and use of pesticides are variables that growers can normally manipulate, identifying optimal chemical use recommendations is a critical step in building a resistance management program.
 Chemical use recommendations are based on one of three different strategies:
 �Management by moderation.
 �Management by multiple attack.
 �Management by saturation.
 Management by moderation is probably the most universal principle for successfully managing resistance.
 It involves reducing overall chemical use or persistence by:
 �using lower dosages of pesticides (when appropriate); appropriate);
 �using higher treatment thresholds; thresholds;
 �using chemicals with shorter residual activity; activity;
 �treating only limited areas in orchard; orchard;
 �maintaining unsprayed areas as refuges for susceptible individuals; and and
 �spraying only specific pest stages.
 Many of these approaches are already common components of IPM programs.
 Practices that protect and promote natural enemies contribute to resistance management since they reduce pesticide use.
 In addition, natural enemies consume resistant and susceptible individuals indiscriminately, thus helping counteract pesticide selection.
 Use of mixtures, for example tank mixes of two or more pesticides, is based on the concept that insects resistant to one pesticide will be killed by the other component(s) of the mixture and that few pests will be resistant to the entire mixture.
 Though mixtures of fungicides have been used for years to combat resistance, both field experience and models have shown that mixtures should be avoided whenever possible with insects and spider mites.
 Commonly, use of mixtures of insecticides or acaricides has resulted in pest populations developing high frequencies of resistance to all pesticides in the mixture, an outcome with disastrous consequences for IPM programs.
 By far the safest approach is to rotate insecticides or acaricides so that each product is used as seldom as possible in any given season.
 Management by saturation involves methods that overcome resistance mechanisms present in pests.
 The most common method is to combat resistance by using high rates of pesticides, ones that kill even resistant individuals.
 Deceptively reasonable on first inspection, this approach rarely works in practice.
 The reason is that pesticide residues are usually deposited very unevenly in most field situations, even when very high rates are used.
 Uneven deposition of pesticides allows resistant pests to survive in greater proportions than susceptible pests, thereby increasing resistance.
 In addition, use of high rates can have many detrimental impacts on natural enemies, the environment, and human health.
 A completely different application of the management by saturation concept involves using chemical synergists, products that enhance the action of pesticides.
 Some synergists have been used successfully to neutralize metabolic pathways conferring resistance.
 Proactive versus reactive resistance management management
 In the past, resistance studies typically have been undertaken or supported by chemical manufacturers only after a pesticide has been used for many years and failures of the product in the field have become commonplace.
 This is reactive resistance management.
 Resistance is known or strongly suspected because of repeated reports of product failure, and the initial research objectives are to develop ways to monitor resistance, assess its intensity and frequency in field populations, and characterize the biochemical mechanism of resistance.
 Thereafter, field studies focus on understanding how quickly resistance builds up following chemical treatment and how fast, if at all, it declines in the absence of the pesticide.
 In recent years, progressive chemical manufacturers have not waited until their products have failed before initiating resistance management efforts.
 Some producers are now addressing management of resistance from the very early stages of product development.
 They are collecting baseline susceptibility information from populations collected from around the world, looking for potential resistance problems, and proposing provisional resistance management strategies for their products early in the process of development.
 These proactive resistance management efforts reflect an overall increase in the sophistication of the chemical industry's resistance management efforts and are likely to prove very beneficial.
 Resistance management as a component of IPM IPM
 Pesticide resistance management will extend the useful life of valuable IPM-compatible pesticides.
 Yet, resistance management is likely to be successful only where orchardists:
 �routinely monitor pests; pests;
 �use reasonable treatment thresholds; and and
 �make full use of nonpesticidal methods, such as biological and cultural control, sanitation and host plant resistance.
 For well developed IPM systems, like those of Pacific Northwest tree fruit, researchers have made considerable progress toward putting in place the essential components of resistance management programs.
 For example, the efficacy of acaricides for mite control in the Pacific Northwest has been sustained for long periods of time where they were used as part of IPM programs.
 The lack of registration of new pesticides, coupled with a loss of registered pesticides to the regulatory process or to resistance, will leave growers with few or no registered products that adequately control key pests.
 It is unrealistic to believe that we can successfully manage resistance if pesticides are not used sparingly.
 Experience from the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere demonstrates that with good IPM practices, the efficacy of key pesticides can be prolonged considerably and, in some cases, maintained indefinitely.
 Scientists have found some new genetic hints that could help explain why bedbugs are so hard to kill.
 Some bedbugs appear to have evolved a mechanism that helps them break down toxins, including the ones in many pesticides, a team from The Ohio State University reports in the journal PLoS ONE.
 The finding comes after earlier research found genetic changes in bedbugs that help protect nerve cells from specific pesticides.
 Together, the findings suggest that current efforts to curb bedbug infestations will be more difficult than in the past, says Susan Jones, an urban entomologist at Ohio State University in Columbus.
 "We're dealing with a different bug than what we were decades ago," Jones says, one that's harder to exterminate.
 The latest genetic explanation for bedbugs' ability to resist pesticides comes from a study comparing genes from modern bedbugs with those from a colony started decades ago by a military bug expert named Harold Harlan.
 We're dealing with a different bug than what we were decades ago.
 - Susan Jones, urban entomologist, Ohio State University University
 Harlan's colony has been kept completely isolated, Jones says.
 "So it has had absolutely no exposure to insecticides," she says." When you expose it to insecticides, the bugs just keel over." over."
 Breaking Down Pesticides Pesticides
 Bugs from Harlan's colony were compared with bugs from an apartment complex in Columbus that had been treated repeatedly with insecticide, Jones says.
 Researchers focused on genes known to be involved in breaking down toxins and removing them from the body, says Omprakash Mittapalli, an entomologist from The Ohio State University in Wooster.
 Mittapalli suspected modern bedbugs had genes that encouraged their bodies to produce more of the enzymes that break down pesticides.
 And, he says, that's just what the team found.
 "These enzymes are indeed higher in the pesticide-exposed populations compared to the pesticide-susceptible population," Mittapalli says.
 Bedbugs' ability to eliminate toxins and protect nerve cells has become quite common, says Ken Haynes, an entomologist at the University of Kentucky who has studied many populations of modern bedbugs.

 He says nearly all of the populations he's studied have some resistance to common pesticides known as pyrethroids.
 And many "have a level of resistance that's quite extraordinary," he says, meaning they can withstand up to 1,000 times the dose that would usually be lethal.
 A New Approach To Killing Bedbugs Bedbugs
 All the new information about resistance suggests it may be time to try a different approach to killing bedbugs, Haynes says.
 "Instead of relying on the same insecticide generation after generation of the bedbugs," Haynes says, "you'd rotate to a different class of pyrethroid or a different class of insecticide altogether with a different mode of action." action."
 Bedbug control also should include nonchemical approaches like heat to kill the bugs and vacuuming to remove them from a room, says Louis Sorkin, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
 "It's not just one chemical approach and that's the end of it," Sorkin says.
 Pesticide resistance is a major concern in natural populations and a model trait to study adaptation.
 Despite the importance of this trait, the dynamics of its evolution and of its ecological consequences remain largely unstudied.
 To fill this gap, we performed experimental evolution with replicated populations of Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to the pesticide Levamisole during 20 generations.
 Exposure to Levamisole resulted in decreased survival, fecundity and male frequency, which declined from 30% to zero.
 This was not due to differential susceptibility of males.
 Rather, the drug affected mobility, resulting in fewer encounters, probably leading to reduced outcrossing rates.
 Adaptation, i.e., increased survival and fecundity, occurred within 10 and 20 generations, respectively.
 Male frequency also increased by generation 20.
 Adaptation costs were undetected in the ancestral environment and in presence of Ivermectin, another widely-used pesticide with an opposite physiological effect.
 Our results demonstrate that pesticide resistance can evolve at an extremely rapid pace.
 Furthermore, we unravel the effects of behaviour on life-history traits and test the environmental dependence of adaptation costs.
 This study establishes experimental evolution as a powerful tool to tackle pesticide resistance, and paves the way to further investigations manipulating environmental and/or genetic factors underlying adaptation to pesticides.

 Introduction Top Top
 Pesticides and antibiotics have been developed to induce high mortality rates on populations of parasites and pests.
 This imposes a strong selection pressure on these organisms, which may lead to the evolution of resistance to such xenobiotics.
 Resistance has indeed been observed in an impressive number of organisms , [2], [3].
 Due to its ubiquity, pesticide resistance is also currently a model trait for the study of adaptation to novel environments [4].
 Laboratory experiments with microorganisms and field studies with multicellular organisms have shown that resistance to xenobiotics occurs within short time frames [5], [6], [7], [8].
 In addition to causing lethality, xenobiotics may also affect the morphology, life history, or behaviour of organisms without killing them.
 For example, many pesticides reduce the fecundity and/or longevity of organisms [9], whereas others cause paralysis, thereby compromising the ability of organisms to find food or mates, or to escape from potential predators [10], [11], [12].
 Despite being frequently overlooked, these sublethal effects can nonetheless affect the performance of organisms and significantly impact fitness [9], [13].
 Hence, it is expected that natural selection will operate towards reducing these deleterious effects induced by pesticides.
 A crucial aspect for both resistance management and our understanding of the evolutionary consequences of adaptation is to evaluate whether the evolution of resistance entails a cost in terms of performance in other environments.
 Indeed, the presence of a cost opens the possibility for managing resistance by creating areas where the pesticide is not spread [14].
 From a fundamental perspective, a cost of adaptation has often been evoked as the mechanism underlying the evolution of specialization.
 Examples from the literature so far suggest that a cost of resistance is indeed common, but that its intensity is variable [15], [16], [17].
 The presence of a cost of adapting to a pesticide, as well as its specific evolutionary dynamics will depend on the degree of resemblance among environments [18], [19], on the genetic basis of adaptation [16], on the genetic background of the organism [20], and on the intensity of selection [21], [22], [23].
 Experimental evolution in replicate populations exposed to pesticides can contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary fate of lethal and sublethal effects caused by chemical stress, as well as to follow the building up of a cost of resistance.
 To date, few studies have been carried out on the experimental evolution of pesticide resistance in multicellular organisms using replicated evolving lines, and none involve an androdioeceous organism.
 In this mating system, males result from an outcrossing event between hermaphrodites and males, whereas hermaphrodites are also able to undergo selfing [24].
 One possible sublethal effect of the pesticide is to affect this mating system, and the build-up of resistance may also interact with it.
 In this study, we followed the experimental evolution of resistance of the androdioecious free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to the widely used pesticide Levamisole.
 This nematicide targets the nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor, resulting in depolarisation of neuronal and muscle cells [25], [26].
 Apart from inducing severe mortality, Levamisole modifies several life-history and behavioural traits of C.
 elegans, including egg laying and mobility [27], [28].
 Hence, we measured adaptation not only as changes in life-history traits such as fecundity and survival, but also as behavioural modifications.
 To investigate whether resistance entailed a cost, we measured the performance of resistant populations in the ancestral environment.
 As detecting a cost of resistance may depend on the environment where this cost is measured [16], we also measured this cost in the presence of another nematicide, Ivermectin.
 Ivermectin acts by being an agonist of glutamate-mediated chloride channels, resulting in the hype-polarization of the membrane of neuronal and muscle cells [29].
 Since Levamisole and Ivermectin operate on excitatory and inhibitory networks, respectively, a strong trade-off in adaptation to the two nematicides is expected.
 Indeed, negative cross-resistance between these pesticides has been shown [30].
 Therefore, we used Ivermectin as an environment where the probability of detecting a cost of adapting to Levamisole is expected to be maximized.
 Results Top Top
 Pesticides significantly affected the survival and fecundity of all populations (GLM, effect of environment, F2,16.045 = 44.05; P<0.0001 and F2,16 = 98.34; P<0.0001).
 The interaction between the environment and the selection regime was significant for survival, but not for fecundity (F2,16 = 12.34; P = 0.0006 and F2,16 = 2.64, P = 0.1, respectively).
 Subsequent analyses were performed on each environment separately.
 Populations evolving in Levamisole had higher survival and fecundity in this environment than populations evolving in a Control environment (Fig.
 1a and 1d; Table 1, effect of selection regime).
 Thus, exposure to Levamisole resulted in adaptation to this environment within 20 generations.
 However, adaptation was very heterogeneous among populations (Table 1, effect of population).
 Differences in fecundity between selection regimes were observed at generation 20 only, whereas differences in survival were established at generation 10 and remained constant thereafter (Figure 1; Table 1, interaction generation*selection regime).

 .In the Control environment, survival and fecundity of individuals from LE populations was not significantly different from that of individuals from C populations (Fig.
 1b and 1e; Table 1, effect of selection regime).
 Thus, adaptation to Levamisole entailed no cost in the ancestral environment.
 These traits did not differ between generations (Table 1, effect of generation), but fecundity in some populations changed between generations, resulting in a significant interaction between generation and population (Table 1).
 In Ivermectin, the survival and fecundity of the LE populations did not differ significantly from that of C populations (Fig.
 1c and 1f; Table 1, effect of selection regime).
 Therefore, resistance to Levamisole was not accompanied by a cost in an environment with Ivermectin.
 As in the Control environment, a significant interaction between generation and population was found (Table 1).
 Male frequency did not differ significantly between the Levamisole and the Control environment (Fig.
 2; GLM, effect of the environment, F1,8 = 0.8, P = 0.39).
 In addition, no significant interaction was found between the environment and the population, selection regime nor generation (GLM, P>0.3 for all interactions).
 Therefore, the environment where individuals developed did not significantly affect the male frequency observed.
 Male frequency differed significantly between LE and C populations when exposed to Levamisole (Fig.
 2a; GLM, effect of the selection regime:
 F1,8 = 34.79, P<0.0001).
 Indeed, the male frequency of LE populations at generation 10 was near 0%, whereas that of C populations varied between 14 and 35%.
 By generation 20, male frequency increased in 3 of the 5 LE populations (Fig.
 2a, GLM.

 .To understand the disappearance of males after 10 generations in Levamisole, we tested the effect of this drug on the survival of each sex separately.
 Significant differences in susceptibility were found between sexes (F1,40 = 68.48; P = 0.001).
 However, males were less sensitive to Levamisole than hermaphrodites.
 Indeed, on average 43.9�3.42% of the hermaphrodites of each population survived to Levamisole, while this proportion was of 69.3�1.4% for males (on average 97.7�1.4% of the hermaphrodites and 100% of the males survived in the control).
 Hence, differences in susceptibility to the pesticide between sexes do not explain the disappearance of males in the LE populations.
 Subsequently, we tested if outcrossing was impaired in the Levamisole environment.,In populations na�ve to the Levamisole environment (the C populations), the number of encounters in Levamisole is significantly lower than in the Control environment (Fig.
 2c; F1,4 = 23.28; P = 0.017).
 This is not the case for the LE1 population, for which these variables do not differ across environments (Fig.
 2c; t18 = 0.33; P = 0.74).
 The rate of encounter of LE1 individuals in the Control environment is comparable to that of C individuals (Fig.
 2c, t11 = 2.2; P = 0.58), and so is the male frequency of that population (Fig.
 2a,b).
 However, compared to C individuals, individuals of the LE1 population encounter mates more often in the Levamisole environment (Fig.
 2c; t10 = 2.23; P = 0.006).
 Therefore, resistance to Levamisole translated also into a behavioural change of the individuals, which allowed for an increase in male frequency.
 Discussion Top Top
 Experimental evolution of C.
 elegans populations in a Levamisole-enriched environment resulted in adaptation to this environment within 20 generations.
 This adaptation to a novel environment entailed no cost in the ancestral environment or in Ivermectin, another pesticide with an opposite physiological mode of action.
 Levamisole paralyzed the nematodes.
 This resulted in fewer encounter rates between males and hermaphrodites and led to the disappearance of males from the populations.
 A build-up of resistance has re-established the mobility of the worms, and concomitantly the male frequency increased.
 Resistance in our outbred populations accumulated within very few generations.
 Therefore, adaptation was most likely due to the standing genetic variation of populations.
 The fact that pesticide resistance is a trait that is relatively easy to select for under artificial selection [31] is in agreement with the prediction that genes conferring pesticide resistance may be present in populations at low frequencies.
 Even though data from natural populations and from artificial selection suggest that resistance can indeed rapidly accumulate, this is the first study providing a direct demonstration of the speed of this process.
 The speed of adaptation varied with the trait measured.
 Indeed, survival increased within 10 generation and had reached a plateau at 20 generations, whereas fecundity increased mostly at generation 20.
 This difference suggests that these traits evolve independently, at least to a certain extent.
 The rapid evolution of resistance to Levamisole was not accompanied by a cost in the ancestral environment.
 This result differs from most studies of pesticide resistance, where a cost was detected [16], [32], [33], [but see 34].
 This discrepancy may be due to the fact that we used a selection pressure that allowed the survival of 25% of the initial population, whereas most studies deal with natural populations, where pesticide doses aim at eradicating all individuals of a pest population.
 In those cases, probably only the most effective mutation conferring resistance is selected.
 Indeed, most resistance mutations described are a one-base-pair change that modifies the binding site of the pesticide in the corresponding neuroreceptor, which is likely to be costly, as other molecules also bind to that site [2].
 Introduction Introduction
 Despite many years of research on alternative methods to control pests and diseases in crops, pesticides retain a vital role in securing global food production and this will remain the case for the foreseeable future if we wish to feed an ever growing population.
 Most classes of pesticides that are currently available have their efficacy threatened by the evolution of resistance to these chemicals in their target pests.
 Scientists at Rothamsted Research are leading work to understand the development and causes of this differential sensitivity to pesticides.
 Research into the causes of resistance therefore supports strategies for optimal and sustainable use of pesticides.
 How does it work?
 The evolution of resistance to pesticides threatens crop protection worldwide.
 Pioneering work at Rothamsted, and elsewhere, has revealed the primary mechanisms of resistance, arising from modifications of proteins targeted by pesticides, or detoxification or export of pesticides before they reach their target site.
 Examples include work on resistance to pyrethroids and neonicotinoids, the two biggest selling classes of insecticides, and azoles, the most important group of fungicides.
 For pyrethroids the scientists have identified key amino acid substitutions in the insecticide target, the voltage-gated sodium channel, and for neonicotinoids elucidated the molecular basis of metabolic and target-site resistance.
 With azoles, the emergence of combinations of changes in the protein target has reduced their effectiveness.
 Current work, with the globally significant aphid pest Myzus persicae and wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola uses genomics to identify genes involved in detoxification of insecticides, or insensitivity to fungicides, an approach that has resulted in high impact findings.

 WEDNESDAY, Oct.
 19 (HealthDay News) -- Some of the genetic traits that give bedbugs resistance to insecticides have been pinpointed by U.S.
 researchers.
 The findings will help efforts to understand the biochemical basis for bedbug resistance to insecticides and provide molecular markers for surveillance.
 "Different bedbug populations within the U.S.
 and throughout the world may differ in their levels of resistance and resistance strategies, so there is the need for continuous surveillance," study author Zach Adelman, an associate professor of entomology with the Vector-Borne Disease Research Group at Virginia Tech, said in a school news release.
 There's been a resurgence of bedbugs in the United States in the past decade, and some bedbugs have developed a resistance to pyrethroids, one of the few classes of insecticides used to control them.
 The Virginia Tech team identified three genes (cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, carboxylesterases and glutathione S-transferases) that produce enzymes that can bind to, deactivate and break down two of the most common pyrethroids, deltamethrin and beta-cyfluthrin.
 The researchers also discovered that insecticide-resistant bedbugs have a mutation in the sodium channel gene.
 This mutation gives the bedbugs partial resistance to pyrethroid insecticides.
 Highly resistant bedbug populations can have a number of genetic traits that protect them against pyrethroids and possibly other insecticides, the researchers concluded.
 Pesticides are substances or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling or mitigating any pest. A pesticide may be a chemical, biological agent (such as a virus or bacterium), antimicrobial, disinfectant or device used against any pest.
 Pests include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, molluscs, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, spread disease or are vectors for disease or cause nuisance.
 Although there are benefits to the use of pesticides, some also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other animals.
 According to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, 9 of the 12 most dangerous and persistent organic chemicals are pesticides.
 Pesticides are categorized into four main substituent chemicals:
 herbicides; fungicides; insecticides and bactericides.[2][3] bactericides.[2][3]

  DefinitionFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has defined the term of pesticide as:
 any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying or controlling any pest, including vectors of human or animal disease, unwanted species of plants or animals causing harm during or otherwise interfering with the production, processing, storage, transport or marketing of food, agricultural commodities, wood and wood products or animal feedstuffs, or substances which may be administered to animals for the control of insects, arachnids or other pests in or on their bodies.
 The term includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit.
 Also used as substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.[4] transport.[4]

 Subclasses of pesticides include:
 herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, pediculicides, and biocides.[3][5] biocides.[3][5]
 Pesticides can be classified by target organism, chemical structure, and physical state.[6] Pesticides can also be classed as inorganic, synthetic, or biologicals (biopesticides),[6] although the distinction can sometimes blur.
 Biopesticides include microbial pesticides and biochemical pesticides.[7] Plant-derived pesticides, or "botanicals", have been developing quickly.
 These include the pyrethroids, rotenoids, nicotinoids, and a fourth group that includes strychnine and scilliroside.[8]:15 scilliroside.[8]:15
 Many pesticides can be grouped into chemical families.
 Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates.
 Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g.
 DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, and other related compounds.
 They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously.
 Their toxicities vary greatly, but they have been phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate.[8]:239-240 Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines.
 Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis.
 Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates, and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates.[8]:136-137 Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates.
 Prominent families of herbicides include pheoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g.
 2,4-D), triazines (e.g.
 atrazine), ureas (e.g.
 diuron), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g.
 alachlor).
 Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broadleaved weeds rather than grasses.
 The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plants nutrient transport system.[8]:300 Triazines interfere with photsynthesis.[8]:335 Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.
 Pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method.
 Most pesticides work by poisoning pests.[9] A systemic pesticide moves inside a plant following absorption by the plant.
 With insecticides and most fungicides, this movement is usually upward (through the xylem) and outward.
 Increased efficiency may be a result.
 Systemic insecticides, which poison pollen and nectar in the flowers, may kill bees and other needed pollinators.
 In 2009, the development of a new class of fungicides called paldoxins was announced.
 These work by taking advantage of natural defense chemicals released by plants called phytoalexins, which fungi then detoxify using enzymes.
 The paldoxins inhibit the fungi's detoxification enzymes.
 They are believed to be safer and greener.[10] greener.[10]
  UsesPesticides are used to control organisms that are considered to be harmful.[11] For example, they are used to kill mosquitoes that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like west nile virus, yellow fever, and malaria.
 They can also kill bees, wasps or ants that can cause allergic reactions.
 Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by parasites such as fleas.[11] Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by moldy food or diseased produce.
 Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees and brush.
 They can also kill invasive weeds that may cause environmental damage.
 Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant.[12] Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mould can damage structures such as houses.[11] Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage rodents and insects that infest food such as grain.
 Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk.
 Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Canada.
 Pesticides can save farmers' money by preventing crop losses to insects and other pests; in the U.S., farmers get an estimated fourfold return on money they spend on pesticides.[13] One study found that not using pesticides reduced crop yields by about 10%.[14] Another study, conducted in 1999, found that a ban on pesticides in the United States may result in a rise of food prices, loss of jobs, and an increase in world hunger.[15] hunger.[15]
 DDT, sprayed on the walls of houses, is an organochloride that has been used to fight malaria since the 1950s.
 Recent policy statements by the World Health Organization have given stronger support to this approach.[16] Dr.
 Arata Kochi, WHO's malaria chief, said, "One of the best tools we have against malaria is indoor residual house spraying.
 Of the dozen insecticides WHO has approved as safe for house spraying, the most effective is DDT."[16] However, since then, an October 2007 study has linked breast cancer from exposure to DDT prior to puberty.[17] Poisoning may also occur due to use of DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons by entering the human food chain when animal tissues are affected.
 Symptoms include nervous excitement, tremors, convulsions or death.
   AmountsIn 2006 and 2008,the world used approximately 5.2 billion pounds of pesticides with herbicides constituting the majority of the world pesticide use at 40% followed by insecticides and fungicides with totals of 17% and 10% respectively.[21] The U.S.
 in 2006 and 2007, used approximately 1.1 billion pounds of pesticides accounting for 22% of the world total.[21] For conventional pesticides which are used in the agricultural sector as well in industry, commercial, governmental and the home & garden sectors, the U.S.
 used at total of 857 million pounds, with the agricultural sector accounting for 80% of the conventional pesticide use total.[21] Pesticides are also found in majority of U.S.
 households with 78 million out of the 105.5 million households indicating that they use some form of pesticide.[21] Currently,there are more than 1,055 active ingredients registered as pesticides,[22] which are put together to produce over 16,000 pesticide products that are being marketed in the United States [23] [23]
  CostsOn the cost side of pesticide use there can be a cost to the environment and human health, as well as the cost of the development and research of new pesticides.
  Health effects effects
 A sign warning about potential pesticide exposure.Main articles:
 Health effects of pesticides and Pesticide poisoning poisoning
 Pesticides may cause acute and delayed health effects in those who are exposed.[24] Pesticide exposure can cause a variety of adverse health effects.
 These effects can range from simple irritation of the skin and eyes to more severe effects such as affecting the nervous system, mimicking hormones causing reproductive problems, and also causing cancer.[25] A 2007 systematic review found that "most studies on non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia showed positive associations with pesticide exposure" and thus concluded that cosmetic use of pesticides should be decreased.[26] Strong evidence also exists for other negative outcomes from pesticide exposure including neurological, birth defects, fetal death,[27] and neurodevelopmental disorder.[28] disorder.[28]
 The American Medical Association recommends limiting exposure to pesticides and using safer alternatives:[6] "Particular uncertainty exists regarding the long-term effects of low-dose pesticide exposures.
 Current surveillance systems are inadequate to characterize potential exposure problems related either to pesticide usage or pesticide-related illnesses�Considering these data gaps, it is prudent�to limit pesticide exposures�and to use the least toxic chemical pesticide or non-chemical alternative." alternative."
 The World Health Organization and the UN Environment Programme estimate that each year, 3 million workers in agriculture in the developing world experience severe poisoning from pesticides, about 18,000 of whom die.[18] According to one study, as many as 25 million workers in developing countries may suffer mild pesticide poisoning yearly.[29] yearly.[29]
 One study found pesticide self-poisoning the method of choice in one third of suicides worldwide, and recommended, among other things, more restrictions on the types of pesticides that are most harmful to humans.[30] humans.[30]
  Environmental effectMain article:
 Environmental effects of pesticides pesticides
 Pesticide use raises a number of environmental concerns.
 Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including non-target species, air, water and soil.[18] Pesticide drift occurs when pesticides suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them.
 Pesticides are one of the causes of water pollution, and some pesticides are persistent organic pollutants and contribute to soil contamination.
 In addition, pesticide use reduces biodiversity, reduces nitrogen fixation,[31] contributes to pollinator decline,[32][33][34][35] destroys habitat (especially for birds),[36] and threatens endangered species.[18] species.[18]
 Pests can develop a resistance to the pesticide (pesticide resistance), necessitating a new pesticide.
 Alternatively a greater dose of the pesticide can be used to counteract the resistance, although this will cause a worsening of the ambient pollution problem.

 Human health and environmental cost from pesticides in the United States is a total of $9.6 billion:[37] billion:[37]
 Additional cost includes the registration process and the cost of purchase pesticides.
 The registration process can take several years to complete the 70 different types of field test and can cost between $50�70 million for a single pesticide.[37] Annually the United States spends $10 billion on pesticides.[37] pesticides.[37]

  MonetaryFor every dollar ($1) that is spent on pesticides for crops yields four dollars ($4) in crops saved.[39] This means based on the amount of money spent per year on pesticides, $10 billion, that there is an additional $40 billion savings in crop that would be lost due to damage by insects and weeds.
 Generally speaking, farmers benefit from having an increase crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year.
 Consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year round.[38] The general public also benefits from the use of pesticides for the control of insect-borne diseases and illnesses, such as malaria.[38] The use of pesticides creates a large job market, which provides jobs for all of the people who work within the industry.
  AlternativesAlternatives to pesticides are available and include methods of cultivation, use of biological pest controls (such as pheromones and microbial pesticides), genetic engineering, and methods of interfering with insect breeding.[18] Application of composted yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pests.[40] These methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides.
 In addition, EPA is registering reduced-risk conventional pesticides in increasing numbers.
 Cultivation practices include polyculture (growing multiple types of plants), crop rotation, planting crops in areas where the pests that damage them do not live, timing planting according to when pests will be least problematic, and use of trap crops that attract pests away from the real crop.[18] In the U.S., farmers have had success controlling insects by spraying with hot water at a cost that is about the same as pesticide spraying.[18] spraying.[18]
 Release of other organisms that fight the pest is another example of an alternative to pesticide use.
 These organisms can include natural predators or parasites of the pests.[18] Biological pesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses cause disease in the pest species can also be used.[18] used.[18]
 Interfering with insects' reproduction can be accomplished by sterilizing males of the target species and releasing them, so that they mate with females but do not produce offspring.
[18] This technique was first used on the screwworm fly in 1958 and has since been used with the medfly, the tsetse fly,[41] and the gypsy moth.
[42] However, this can be a costly, time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.
 Another alternative to pesticides is the thermal treatment of soil through steam.
 Soil steaming kills pest and increases soil health. needed]
 In India, traditional pest control methods include using Panchakavya, the "mixture of five products." 
The method has recently experienced a resurgence in popularity due in part to use by the organic farming community. needed]
  Push pull strategyThe term "push-pull" was established in 1987 as an approach for integrated pest management (IPM).
 This strategy uses a mixture of behavior-modifying stimuli to manipulate the distribution and abundance of insects.
 "Push" means the insects are repelled or deterred away from whatever resource that is being protected.
 "Pull" means that certain stimuli (semiochemical stimuli, pheromones, food additives, visual stimuli, genetically altered plants, etc.) are used to attract pests to trap crops where they will be killed
There are numerous different components involved in order to implement a Push-Pull Strategy in IPM.
 Many case studies testing the effectiveness of the push-pull approach have been done across the world.
 The most successful push-pull strategy was developed in Africa for subsistence farming.
 Another successful case study was performed on the control of Helicoverpa in cotton crops in Australia.
 In Europe, the Middle East, and the United States, push-pull strategies were successfully used in the controlling of Sitona lineatus in bean fields.
[43] Plus many more cases where this strategy was more beneficial than simply using pesticides on their crops.
 Some advantages of using the push-pull method are less use of chemical or biological materials and better protection against insect habituation to this control method.
 Some disadvantages of the push-pull strategy is that if there is a lack of appropriate knowledge of behavioral and chemical ecology of the host-pest interactions then this method becomes unreliable.
 Furthermore, because the push-pull method is not a very popular method of IPM operational and registration costs are higher.[44] higher.[44]
   EffectivenessSome evidence shows that alternatives to pesticides can be equally effective as the use of chemicals.
 For example, Sweden has halved its use of pesticides with hardly any reduction in crops.
[18] In Indonesia, farmers have reduced pesticide use on rice fields by 65% and experienced a 15% crop increase.
[18] A study of Maize yields in northern Florida found that the application of composted yard waste with high carbon to nitrogen ratio to agricultural fields was highly effective at reducing the population of plant-parasitic nematodes and increasing crop yield, with yield increases ranging from 10% to 212%; the observed effects were long-term, often not appearing until the third season of the study.
 However, pesticide resistance is increasing.
 In the 1940s, U.S.
 farmers lost only 7% of their crops to pests.
 Since the 1980s, loss has increased to 13%, even though more pesticides are being used.
 Between 500 and 1,000 insect and weed species have developed pesticide resistance since 1945.[45] 1945.[45]
 InternationalIn Europe, recent EU legislation has been approved banning the use of highly toxic pesticides including those that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, those that are endocrine-disrupting, and those that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB).
 Measures were approved to improve the general safety of pesticides across all EU member states.[46] states.[46]
 Though pesticide regulations differ from country to country, pesticides and products on which they were used are traded across international borders.
 To deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries, delegates to a conference of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization adopted an International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for different countries.
[47] The Code was updated in 1998 and 2002.[48] The FAO claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use.[4] use.[4]
 Three other efforts to improve regulation of international pesticide trade are the United Nations London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade and the United Nations Codex Alimentarius Commission.
 The former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides, while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries.
[49] Both initiatives operate on a voluntary basis.[49] basis.[49]
 Pesticide safety education and pesticide applicator regulation are designed to protect the public from pesticide misuse, but do not eliminate all misuse.
 Reducing the use of pesticides and choosing less toxic pesticides may reduce risks placed on society and the environment from pesticide use.
[12] Integrated pest management, the use of multiple approaches to control pests, is becoming widespread and has been used with success in countries such as Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, the U.S., Australia, and Mexico.
[18] IPM attempts to recognize the more widespread impacts of an action on an ecosystem, so that natural balances are not upset.
[50] New pesticides are being developed, including biological and botanical derivatives and alternatives that are thought to reduce health and environmental risks.
 Pesticides can be created that are targeted to a specific pest's life cycle, which can be environmentally more friendly.
[51] For example, potato cyst nematodes emerge from their protective cysts in response to a chemical excreted by potatoes; they feed on the potatoes and damage the crop.
[51] A similar chemical can be applied to fields early, before the potatoes are planted, causing the nematodes to emerge early and starve in the absence of potatoes.[51] potatoes.[51]
  United StatesMain article:
 Pesticide regulation in the United States States
 Preparation for an application of hazardous pesticide in USA.In most countries, pesticides must be approved for sale and use by a government agency.
[47] In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for regulating pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA).
[52] Complex and costly studies must be conducted to indicate whether the material is safe to use and effective against the intended pest.
 The EPA regulates pesticides to ensure that these products do not pose adverse effects to humans or the environment.
 Pesticides produced before November 1984 continue to be reassessed in order to meet the current scientific and regulatory standards.
 All registered pesticides are reviewed every 15 years to ensure they meet the proper standards.[52] During the registration process, a label is created.
 The label contains directions for proper use of the material.
 Based on acute toxicity, pestices are assigned to a Toxicity Class.
 Some pesticides are considered too hazardous for sale to the general public and are designated restricted use pesticides.
 Only certified applicators, who have passed an exam, may purchase or supervise the application of restricted use pesticides.[47] Records of sales and use are required to be maintained and may be audited by government agencies charged with the enforcement of pesticide regulations. needed]
 The EPA regulates pesticides under two under main acts, both of which were amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996.
 In addition to the EPA, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set standards for the level of pesticide residue that is allowed on or in crops 
 The EPA looks at what the potential human health and environmental effects might be associated with the use of the pesticide.
 Additionally, the U.S.
 EPA uses the National Research Council's four-step process for human health risk assessment:
 (1) Hazard Identification, (2) Dose-Response Assessment, (3) Exposure Assessment, and (4) Risk Characterization.
  HistorySince before 2000 BC, humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops.
 The first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia.
 By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests.
 In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide.
 The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which is derived from the roots of tropical vegetables.[56] Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant.[57] Paul M�ller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide.
 Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S.
 by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975.
 Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide.[57] Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by "triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate".[57] glyphosate".[57]
 The first legislation providing federal authority for regulating pesticides was enacted in 1910;[58] however, decades later during the 1940s manufacturers began to produce large amounts of synthetic pesticides and their use became widespread.
 Some sources consider the 1940s and 1950s to have been the start of the "pesticide era."[59] Although the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency was established in 1970 and amendments to the pesticide law in 1972,[60] pesticide use has increased 50-fold since 1950 and 2.3 million tonnes (2.5 million short tons) of industrial pesticides are now used each year.
Seventy-five percent of all pesticides in the world are used in developed countries, but use in developing countries is increasing.
 In 2001 the EPA stopped reporting yearly pesticide use statistics.
 A study of USA pesticide use trends through 1997 was published in 2003 by the National Science Foundation's Center for Integrated Pest Management.[57][61] Management.[57][61]
 In the 1960s, it was discovered that DDT was preventing many fish-eating birds from reproducing, which was a serious threat to biodiversity.
 Rachel Carson wrote the best-selling book Silent Spring about biological magnification.
 The agricultural use of DDT is now banned under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, but it is still used in some developing nations to prevent malaria and other tropical diseases by spraying on interior walls to kill or repel mosquitoes.
 Pesticides present a substantial danger to people and the environment when improperly stored.

 Purpose or Problem Problem
 The purpose is to try to find natural substances that will act as a pesticide that can be safely used around the home.
 Overview Overview
 Insect pests are something everyone must deal with around their home.
 Sour flies around fruit and ants in the kitchen can be a nuisance.
 Hardware stores and supermarkets sell chemical pesticides, often in aerosol bottles, to spray in your home.
 But, some pesticide chemicals have the potential of being hazardous to our health.
 We want to be careful about using chemicals around the eating areas of our home, in rooms where children play, and in our yards when well water supplies our home.
 Are there more natural substances we could use to keep away common household pests, such as flies, sour flies, and ants?
 Natural substances (lemon juice or tea, for example) would not only be safer, but they also might smell better than a commercial pesticide product.
 Hypothesis Hypothesis
 Several hypotheses can be developed:
 �Hypothesize that lemon juice can (or can't) be used as a natural deterrent for fruit flies.
 �Hypothesize that grapefruit juice can (or can't) be used as a natural deterrent for fruit flies.
 �Hypothesize that concentrated tea can (or can't) be used as a natural deterrent for fruit flies.
 (Also develop similar hypotheses about ants.) ants.)
 Materials' List List
 �Several lemons lemons
 �Several grapefruits grapefruits
 �Tea bags bags
 �Three shallow bowls or dishes dishes
 �Drinking glass glass
 �Several bananas bananas
 �Tea cup (or mug) mug)
 �Boiling water water
 �Three spray bottles bottles
 �Two paper coffee filters filters
 �Funnel �Funnel
 �Microwave oven (or a tea kettle and use of a stove) stove)
 �Anthill �Anthill
 �Glass jar with lid lid
 Procedure Procedure
 Line a funnel with a paper coffee filter and set it in a drinking glass.
 Squeeze the juice from several lemons into the funnel filter.
 Remove the funnel filter and pour the juice into a shallow, wide dish or bowl.
 Let the juice stand for a day or two to evaporate some of the water and make a more concentrated solution.
 In a similar way, squeeze the juice of a grapefruit through a funnel filter into a drinking glass.
 Then, pour into a shallow dish or bowl and allow the juice to evaporate for a day or two to make a more concentrated solution.
 Make a cup of boiling water as you would when you make a cup of tea, using either a microwave oven or a tea kettle on a stove.
 Steep several tea bags in the hot water.
 Let cool.
 Then, pour the tea into a shallow dish or bowl and let some of the water evaporate for a day or two to make a concentrated solution.
 Pour each of your three natural insecticide liquids in three spray bottles.
 �Testing effectiveness against fruit flies.
 Fruit flies can often be seen hovering around a bowl of fruit.
 As fruit ripens, especially bananas, fruit flies can't resist them.
 Would spraying bananas with a natural substance such as grapefruit juice, lemon juice, or tea deter fruit flies?
 Place several bananas in a bowl and allow them to ripen and draw fruit flies.
 When fruit flies appear, cut one of the ripened bananas lengthwise in half, and then cut each half lengthwise in half again, making four pieces of banana.
 Lay them out, side by side, and observe the behavior of fruit flies around the pieces.
 Spray one piece of banana with your lemon concentrate, another with the grapefruit concentrate, and another with the tea concentrate.
 Leave the fourth piece alone as a control.
 Lay the pieces out again, but leave four or five inches between each one.
 Observe the behavior of the fruit flies.
 Do any of the sprayed banana pieces appear to repel the flies?
 �Testing effectiveness against ants.
 Locate an active anthill and capture several ants in a jar.
 On a board or outside on pavement, set down the jar.
 Remove the sprayer from the lemon-filled spray bottle and pour a six-inch diameter circle around the jar.
 Open the jar of ants.
 Do the ants cross the ring of lemon?
 Repeat using the grapefruit juice, and then the tea concentrate.
 To ensure that the ants are not simply responding to a liquid, lay a line of plain water in front of the ants to compare their behavior to your insecticides.
 Observe the behavior of the ants.
 The county Department of Health Services has begun an experiment this month that involves applying malathion to the skin of children volunteers to determine whether the pesticide can provoke an allergic response in human beings.
 Only a small amount of malathion is being used on the children and health officials say the worst they expect to see is minor skin reddening and possibly some swelling.

 xiameter.com/chemical+industry+newsHealth officials say the experiment is one of only about a dozen human studies that have been directly drawn from the California malathion spraying experience and thus is a critical link in understanding the effects of the aerial campaign on the public.
 But anti-malathion activists, still angry and afraid over the spraying battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly, are calling the experiment an irresponsible foray into the world of weird science.
 Patty Prickett, coordinator of the anti-malathion group Residents Against Spraying Pesticides, said she believes the long-term dangers of malathion are too poorly understood to expose children, whatever the dose.
 "I can't believe they're exposing kids all over again to malathion," Prickett said.
 "My kid will not be a guinea pig, he's been a guinea pig long enough." enough."
 The experiment involves a standard allergy test in which patches of malathion, fly bait and a mixture of the two are placed on the skin of a subject.
 Researchers also are using a so-called "scratch" test in which a subject's skin is pricked with diluted concentrations of malathion.
 No child is being exposed to more than 11 milligrams of malathion--about the same as what was sprayed on six square feet during the state's aerial campaign against the Medfly.
 "The amount is minuscule," said Kim Woloshin, the county health official coordinating the study.
 "There is a head lotion for lice that has more malathion in it." it."
 The department already has conducted tests on a group of about 30 adult volunteers, who were drawn from a list of people who complained of rashes, hives, swelling and other allergic symptoms because of malathion spraying.
 No subject showed any reaction beyond skin reddening and some swelling.
 "I really don't think we're putting children at risk," Woloshin said.
 "The hardest part is having the kids sit there for 20 minutes." minutes."
 The child study has been approved by a scientific panel from UCLA charged with reviewing human experiments at the university.
 All the children's parents have given permission to join the study.
 Pesticides or plant protection products are used to effectively protect crops against harmful organisms.
 Around 640 plant protection products are currently authorised in Germany.
 Even when these pesticides are used properly and according to their intended uses, residues may remain on the harvested crops.
 These residues should be kept to a minimum so that they will not harm the health of consumers either through long-term daily food intake or short-term consumption of large portions of foods.
 In order to ensure this, BfR undertakes a comprehensive risk assessment for consumers within pesticide authorisation procedures.
 This risk assessment then serves as basis for proposed maximum residue levels (MRLs, also known as maximum residue limits).
 A maximum residue level is the maximum concentration of a pesticide residue that is legally permitted in or on foodstuffs.
 The general population is largely unaware of this legislative restriction.
 Many consumers assume that absolutely no residues of pesticides are permitted in or on foodstuffs.
 This came to light as a result of the representative survey of the German population on the subject of pesticide residues in foods which was commissioned by BfR.
 In response to this, BfR has compiled frequently asked questions regarding the authorisation of pesticides, the setting of maximum residue levels and consequences if these levels are exceeded.

 Why are plant protection products used?
 Plant protection products are designed to offer plants effective protection against harmful organisms such as fungi, weeds or harmful insects and secure the harvest.
 Furthermore, they are used to protect the harvested crops during storage and transport and to guarantee that food is of a good quality.
 While far fewer pesticides are used in organic faming than in conventional farming, even organic farmers cannot manage completely without the aid of chemical pesticides.
 Up Up
 What is the difference between plant protection products and active substances?
 Active substances are chemical elements and compounds or micro-organisms with general or targeted action against harmful organisms on plants, parts of plants or plant products.
 Plant protection products are commercially available preparations which contain one or more active substances.
 Up Up
 How many active substances does a plant protection product contain?
 Of those plant protection products authorised in Germany, 71 percent contain just one active substance, 25 percent contain two active substances and four percent contain three or four active substances (status October 2010).
 Up Up
 How many plant protection products are authorised in Germany?
 As of October 2010, 641 different plant protection products with 1192 commercial names have been authorised in Germany.
 These products contain a total of 249 different active substances.
 Up Up
 Through what process does a plant protection product become available on the German market?
 Plant protection products must be authorised before they can become available on the market or used in agriculture.
 Authorisation is granted for a certain purpose (indication) which is why this is referred to as an authorisation �for indicated uses only�.
 Plant protection products are authorised on the national level.
 In Germany authorisation is granted by the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL).
 The Julius K�hn Institute - the Federal Research Centre for Cultivated Plants (JKI), the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) and the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) are involved in the authorisation procedure.
 These carry out partial evaluations within the scope of their jurisdiction.
 BfR assesses the health risks for consumers, workers, residents and bystanders.
 In future, EU Member States will cooperate closely in authorisation procedures.
 Up Up
 Are active substances also authorised?
 Active substances are not approved separately but always as part of a plant protection product.
 On the European Community level a positive list is currently being drawn up in which active substances are included after they have been examined in the European Union according to uniform principles.
 Only listed substances may be used in plant protection products.
 Up Up
 What is meant by pesticide residues?
 Pesticide residues is the term used for any remains of active substances and their degradation products in or on food and feed.
 Degradation products may be formed during plant metabolism (�metabolites�) or, for example, under the influence of sunlight.
 Up Up
 How is it possible that the use of plant protection products can leave residues on the harvested crops?
 Residues on harvested crops cannot be completely avoided even in the case of good agricultural practice and the proper use of pesticides.
 Plant protection products are used at different times during the growth season.
 The degradation rates of their active substances vary.
 Residues must be expected at the time of harvesting, particularly when plant protection products are applied shortly before harvesting or when their active substances are persistent.
 However, the levels must be low enough that they do not pose a human health risk.
 Up Up
 Are pesticide residues allowed in foods?
 Residues of plant protection products are allowed up to each maximum residue level.
 There are no adverse effects on human health up to these concentrations.
 Up Up
 Which foods may have pesticide residues?
 Pesticide residues may be found on foods of plant origin.
 However, foods of animal origin may also have residues when the animals have eaten feed of plant origin that contained residues.
 Up Up
 What is meant by "good agricultural practice"?
 The principles of "good agricultural practice" also called "good plant protection practice" are instructions and apply to everyone who carries out plant protection measures.
 They stipulate that pesticides must be used in a manner that is adequate to suit the location, crop and situation, and that their use must be kept to the necessary minimum.
 Plant protection products should only be used when there is a case of infestation that "requires control".
 The necessary plant protection measures must be carried out appropriately and documented.
 Up Up
 What influence does BfR have on authorisation of plant protection products?
 BfR is involved in the authorisation procedure as a consenting agency.
 It only agrees to the authorisation of a plant protection product when the residues which may remain on foods after correct use do not pose a health risk.
 The BfR opinion is taken into account when a decision on authorisation is made.
 Up Up
 How does BfR determine a possible risk to consumers during the authorisation procedure?
 BfR carries out a risk assessment to ascertain a possible consumer risk from pesticide residues.
 Two factors are taken into account:
 the harmful (toxic) effect of a dose of a pesticide and the amount of this pesticide which is ingested by a consumer from contaminated products.
 This intake is described as "exposure".
 Up Up
 How does BfR determine the toxic effect of an active substance?
 The toxic effect is determined on the basis of study results.
 These are mostly animal studies which provide information on the acute, subchronic and chronic toxicity of an active pesticide substance.
 Furthermore, these provide information on possible DNA-damaging (genotoxic) and cancer-causing (carcinogenic) properties of the substance as well as whether it is toxic for reproduction.
 BfR derives two important toxicological threshold values from these studies:
 the acute reference dose (ARfD) and the acceptable daily intake (ADI).
 The ARfD refers to the acute and the ADI to the chronic effect of a substance.
 Up Up
 What is an ADI?
 ADI stands for "Acceptable Daily Intake" and indicates the amount of a substance which can be ingested daily over a lifetime by consumers without any appreciable health risk.
 The ADI is used to assess the chronic risk.
 Up Up
 What is meant by the acute reference dose?
 The �Acute Reference Dose� (ARfD) is the amount of a substance which a consumer may ingest during one day (spread over one or more meals) without any appreciable health risk.
 The ARfD is used to assess the acute risk.
 Up Up
 How does BfR establish the ARfD and the ADI?
 In suitable animal experiments the �No Observed Adverse Effect Level� (NOAEL) is established for the most sensitive species and the most sensitive gender.
 Short-term studies are normally used to establish the ARfD.
 The ADI is determined from toxicity studies in which chronic endpoints were examined.
 These are often carcinogenicity, reproduction or multigeneration studies.
 The no observed adverse effect level established from the relevant studies is then divided by a so-called (un)certainty factor which should take into account both inter-species differences (i.e.
 between animals and humans) as well as intra-species differences (i.e.
 between individuals).
 The factor 100 is normally used for this.
 Up Up
 How does BfR determine consumer exposure to pesticide residues within the authorisation procedure?
 Consumer exposure to food (dietary intake) is determined from the level of residue in the food and the amount of food consumed.
 The concentration of the residue in the food is determined in studies in which the pesticide was used under real conditions (so-called supervised residue trials).
 The relevant portions of foods consumed are taken from so-called food consumption surveys.
 Up Up
 Which food consumption data does BfR take into account in pesticide risk assessment?
 The portions of food which are currently relevant for consumers in Germany were collected in a food survey published in 2005 on German children aged two to under five years.
 This subgroup is considered being particularly vulnerable because of its comparably high dietary intake in conjunction with low body weight.
 This group is used as a surrogate for the whole population in risk assessment.
 In early 2011 additional consumption data will be available for pesticide risk assessment.
 These were collected for German consumers aged 14 to 80 years during the National nutrition survey II (NVS II).
 In addition to German consumption data, BfR also takes consumption data from other European Member States into account.
 Up Up
 When does BfR agree to authorisation in regard to consumer health protection?
 The risk for the consumer is only unlikely enough to justify the authorisation of a pesticide from the perspective of consumer health protection if the assessment concludes that neither ADI nor ARfD are exceeded as a result of residues from the use of the pesticide.
 A threat to consumer health is not expected if the following conditions are met:
 The estimated maximum dietary intake of a pesticide residue is below the ARfD.
 The maximum dietary intake is calculated for each food individually from the highest amount of residue that occurred in the supervised residue trials in conjunction with the �large portion� from food consumption surveys.
 The estimated average intake of pesticide residues remains below the ADI.
 The average intake is calculated from the median of the results of the supervised residue trials and the average portion from food consumption surveys and is added up for all foods consumed.
 Up Up
 Are plant protection products with carcinogenic active ingredients authorised?
 Cancer-causing substances must be separated into those that are both carcinogenic and genotoxic and those that can cause cancer without damaging genetic material.
 A threshold cannot be determined for substances that are carcinogenic and genotoxic at the same time because any amount can be damaging to human health.
 Plant protection products that contain such substances are categorically never authorised in Germany.
 According to the current state of scientific knowledge, substances that are carcinogenic without damaging genetic material do have a threshold.
 Below this amount, a carcinogenic effect is not expected.
 These substances do not cause adverse health effects as long as consumer exposure does not exceed the threshold value for chronic exposure (ADI).
 Up Up
 Are the authorisation criteria that are currently in force enough to eliminate consumer risks with enough certainty?
 From the risk assessment perspective, current authorisation criteria eliminate consumer risks with enough certainty and comply with the precautionary principle that exists in the European Union.
 This principle comes into effect anytime there is reasonable cause for concern and the scientific evidence does not provide enough information to dispel concern.
 Through its uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation, the European Commission has provided a high level of protection in regard to pesticides:
 Pesticides may only be authorised if their use according to good agricultural practice does not have any adverse effects on human health.
 In order to fulfil the conditions of authorisation, comprehensive studies regarding toxicity, residue behaviour, methods of residue analysis, the fate and behaviour in the environment as well as effects on flora and fauna must be provided.
 Active ingredients in pesticides are thus among the most well analysed and characterised chemical substances concerning possible health risks and hazards.
 Based on the adverse effect and the dose-response relationship that have been determined through toxicological testing it is generally possible to characterise and quantify the occurrence of adverse effects as a result of a defined exposure.
 It is similarly possible to estimate the dose ranges in which adverse health effects can be practically excluded.
 The likelihood of a possible health risk for consumers can be determined with sufficient certainty.
 Up Up
 What happens when a residue exceeds the ADI or ARfD?
 A one-off exceedance of the ADI is not relevant and even the short-term exceedance of the ADI does not lead to a risk for consumers because this value is established on the basis of daily lifelong exposure.
 In contrast, possible adverse health effects cannot be automatically ruled out when there is a one-off or short-term exceedance of the ARfD.
 Whether adverse health effects could actually occur must be determined on a case-by-case basis.
 Up Up
 What are maximum residue levels?
 A maximum residue level indicates the maximum admissible concentration of an active pesticide substance in or on a food.
 Maximum residue levels serve as binding trade standards to guarantee the free movement of goods.
 Foods are only marketable when they comply with maximum residue levels.
 Up Up
 How are maximum residue levels set?
 The procedure for setting maximum residue levels is formally independent from the authorisation procedure for pesticides.
 Maximum levels are derived in a Community procedure by experts from the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and tested for their safety.
 They are then approved and published in legally binding form by the European Commission.
 Since these are EU Regulations, the same maximum levels automatically apply in all Member States.
 Up Up
 Which requirements must be met by maximum residue levels?
 Before a maximum residue level can be laid down, it must be possible to monitor the residue.
 A suitable analytical method is needed, preferably through a fast and easy routine analytical procedure.
 Furthermore, maximum residue levels may constitute neither an acute nor a chronic risk for consumers.
 In order to be able to assess this, a toxicological assessment of the active substance and its residue behaviour must be carried out.
 Up Up
 How does BfR draw up its proposals for maximum residue levels?
 Maximum residue levels are never set higher than is necessary on the grounds of good agricultural practice.
 This complies with the minimisation principle for the use of pesticides.
 The basis for setting maximum residue levels are supervised residue field trials conducted in line with the applied use of a pesticide for controlling a harmful organism.
 The trials are designed in such a way that, under controlled conditions, the most critical approvable application is tested:
 the highest admissible application rate, the highest admissible number of applications, the latest admissible time of application and the shortest interval between the last application and harvesting (PHI, pre-harvest interval).
 Test results serve as basis in order to establish which (unavoidable) pesticide residue remains on the harvested crops following correct use.
 A corresponding proposal for a maximum level is derived from the residue data.
 If applicable, further factors like residue behaviour after processing are also taken into account.
 Finally, the derived maximum residue level is tested for its acceptability in regard to human health, i.e.
 whether or not residues of this amount constitute an acute or chronic risk to consumers.
 BfR proposes any maximum residue levels only if there are no indications that suggest a consumer risk.
 Up Up
 What are import tolerances?
 Import tolerances correspond to the maximum residue levels but refer to foods which are imported into the European Union (e.g.
 rice, tropical fruit).
 Import tolerances are only granted for active substance-food combinations for which applications have been submitted when BfR comes to the conclusion that residues of the applied-for amounts do not constitute a health risk for consumers.
 Up Up
 Why are maximum residue levels changed?
 The setting of maximum residue levels is an ongoing process.
 As soon as applications for new uses and/or new pesticides are received and corresponding residue studies are submitted, the existing maximum level must be re-evaluated and, if necessary, amended.
 Furthermore, maximum residue levels are adapted in line with improvement of scientific knowledge.
 New toxicity studies or new consumption data, for instance, may lead to a change in existing maximum residue levels because risk assessment has been updated and the safety of maximum residue levels has been reviewed.
 Up Up
 What happens when a residue exceeds the maximum residue level?
 The exceedance of a maximum residue level constitutes a violation of applicable law.
 The product in question is not marketable.
 This does not necessarily mean that the identified residue constitutes a risk for consumers as maximum residue levels are not toxicological threshold values.
 Normally far higher residue concentrations would be needed to reach toxicological threshold values (ADI or ARfD).
 When the level is exceeded, a risk assessment is undertaken.
 In most cases in the past the residue identified was not harmful for consumers.
 Up Up
 Does the health risk increase if a food contains residues of several plant protection products (multiple residues)?
 According to the most current state of knowledge, a health risk does not increase through residues of several active pesticide substances in one food.
 Within the authorisation procedure of plant protection products and the regulation of maximum residue levels, one dose is determined experimentally for all active pesticide substances below which no toxic effect is detectable.
 Therefore, the dose range within which these substances are without adverse health effect can be assessed even when several substances are in a food at the same time.
 Maximum residue levels usually correspond to concentrations that are below the NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) by more than one safety factor of 100.
 Thus, as long as the permissible maximum residue levels of individual active substances are not exceeded, additive or synergistic effects of pesticide residues in foods that could lead to adverse human health effects for the consumer are virtually eliminated.
 Up Up
 With what result has BfR assessed monitoring samples with multiple residues thus far?
 BfR experience with assessments of food samples that contained multiple residues shows that most substances were present only at very low concentrations.
 In most cases, the total residue amount was dominated by one active substance.
 It was also clear that active substances that were present at the same time were often members of different classes of pesticides with vastly different toxicological modes of action.
 Additive or synergistic effects, as they are primarily expected from substances that have similar effects on the organism, were virtually non-existent in these cases.
 Even if samples contained several active substances of the same class of pesticides, the cumulative assessment of these substances did not lead to a fundamentally different result than assessments of single substances.
 Up Up
 Why do multiple residues occur and could they be avoided?
 The most recent active pesticide substances distinguish themselves through their targeted effects on certain harmful organisms, while substances of earlier generations have more broad effects and thus also more side effects.
 The targeted effect is better for humans and the environment.
 However, as a result many different pesticides are used depending on the type of infestation.
 All of these can leave residues on the harvested product.
 The active substance used may also be changed in order to prevent the development of resistance.
 Resistances must be prevented because they would mean that in the long run, certain harmful organisms could no longer be controlled.
 Multiple residues are thus the result of appropriate and targeted application of plant protection products and not always avoidable.
 Up Up
 Who monitors compliance with the maximum residue levels?
 Every party involved in food marketing and distribution is obliged to guarantee compliance with maximum residue levels.
 Food retailers normally conduct internal quality controls.
 The official control authorities of the federal states draw up monitoring and surveillance programmes to make sure that companies perform their duty of care and consumers are sufficiently protected.
 Up Up
 How do consumers estimate the risks they face through residues of pesticides in foods?
 Consumers themselves estimate that residues of pesticides in food constitute a relatively high health risk.
 However, thus far pesticide residues in food have never known to have had any adverse health effects for consumers in Germany.
 As a result, BfR continually aims to inform consumers in order to provide them the basis for a realistic assessment of the risk.
 In order to do so, BfR cooperates with a number of stakeholders and multipliers.
 Up Up
 How does BfR judge initiatives by food retailers to reduce pesticide residues on foods?
 If the statutory maximum residue levels are adhered to, foods are safe.
 However, some retail chains issue additional requirements regarding maximum levels for pesticide residues in foods for their suppliers.
 These are much stricter than legal requirements (so-called secondary standards).
 In general BfR values all endeavours that aim to minimise the application of plant protection products in agricultural practice and those that minimise residues on foods.
 However, BfR is also aware of the hazards associated with undesirable effects that secondary standards can have on the use of pesticides.
 The conscious evasion of a change of active substance (with the aim to minimise the total number of detectable active substances in foods) can lead to increasing resistance of harmful organisms.
 As a result, these can no longer be controlled or only with great difficulty.
 In order to minimise residues in harvested products, producers increasing feel compelled to apply pesticides preventively and early on in the growing season instead of according to need and situation as it would correspond with "good agricultural practice".
 Furthermore, the establishment of secondary standards could also worry consumers which may wrongly lead them to loose confidence in legal regulations and official risk assessments.

 Biological Pesticides Soil Microbe Inoculants Inoculants
 A bio-pesticide is the term used for microbial biological pest control agents that are usually applied in a similar manner to chemical pesticides.
 These may be of a bacterial, fungal, viral nature or beneficial predatory nematodes.
 See insect predators.
 Avonrod supply a wide range of soil microbe inoculants that restore the natural balance to soils that have been fumigated or damaged by improper agricultural practices.
 Some are used to combat plant pathogens or compete with potential pathogens for �living space.� Others are essential for the natural development, germination of seed or enhanced growth of certain plant species,--- others assist with the natural decomposition of organic matter.
 Miscellaneous Chemicals Fungicides Fungicides
 Avonrod can source and supply a wide range of obscure chemicals and materials required in the horticultural / agricultural industry.
 You are welcome to discuss your requirements with our personnel.
 Fungicides are chemical compounds or in some instances, biological organisms, used to control pathogenic fungi or the spores there of.
 Fungi are capable of causing serious damage to crops and stored produce, resulting in critical losses of yield, quality and profit.
 The toxins produced by some fungi may lead to serious health problems of consumers of infected agricultural produce.
 Avonrod can assist with recommendations of the correct safe registered remedy or provide an I.P.M.
 (Integrated Pest Management) strategy.
 Insect Predators Plant Growth Regulators Regulators
 These are beneficial insects that prey on pest insects or mites, these are in some cases commercially available for use in situations where biological control or IPM (Integrated Pest Management) is practiced.
 Avonrod can arrange the supply or importation of some of these predators, (subject to the availability of import permits.) Plant growth regulators also known as phytohormones) are chemicals that regulate plant growth.
 Plant hormones are signal molecules produced within the plant, and occur in extremely low concentrations.
 Hormones regulate cellular processes in targeted cells locally and when moved to other locations, in other locations of the plant.
 Plants, unlike animals, lack glands that produce and secrete hormones.
 Plant hormones shape the plant, affecting seed growth, time of flowering, the sex of flowers, senescence of leaves and fruits.
 Acaracides Herbicides (Weed Killers) Killers)
 Are pesticides specifically or mainly for the control of mites (phytophagous mites) on crops.
 We carry a wide range of both chemical and biological acaracides.
 Are compounds used to remove undesirable plants (weeds) that may compete with crops, cause damage to structures, present fire hazard, impede work crews, obstruct waterways or are unsightly.
 When used correctly they can reduce labour costs drastically.
 Selective herbicides can remove specific target weeds while leaving the desired crop relatively undamaged.
 We can advise and supply the appropriate product.
 Pest Control Products Fertilisers Fertilisers
 Pest control refers to the regulation or management of a species defined as a pest, usually because it is perceived to be detrimental to a person's health, the ecology or the economy.
 Fertilisers are minerals and organic compounds applied to plants to promote growth, supplement the nutrition or restore the balance of the required nutrients of crops to achieve maximum yield.
 We carry a range of speciality fertilisers.
 Spray Equipment Rodenticides & Pest Control Products Products

 Introduction Introduction
 Many Commonwealth and NSW government agencies, as well as other stakeholder organisations, have a role in managing pesticides in NSW.
 This fact sheet explains the roles of some of these organisations and provides information on where to seek guidance on pesticides and their use.
 Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority Authority
 Pesticide products sold in Australia must be approved and registered by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).
 Before registering the product, the APVMA is required to conduct an assessment of potential impacts of the pesticide on the environment, human health and trade, and of the likely effectiveness of the pesticide for its proposed uses.
 When a pesticide contains an active constituent not previously used in Australia, the APVMA must seek public comment before registering the product.
 Only registered pesticides can be used in NSW, unless the APVMA grants approval for use under a permit.
 Registration includes approval of label directions for each pesticide product.
 Label directions specify how, and under which circumstances, the pesticide may be used to treat the relevant target pest or pests.
 Labels also give directions on clean-up, storage and disposal, and personal and environmental safety.
 After registration, the APVMA regulates pesticides up to and including the point of retail sale.
 Once sold, pesticides are regulated by each State's control-of-use legislation.
 The APVMA's Chemical Review Program reviews the registration of existing pesticides to determine whether changes are necessary to the registration or whether the registration should be withdrawn.
 The APVMA invites the public to make submissions on existing pesticides, and these submissions are considered as part of the review.
 The APVMA has published information sheets, which set out its role and responsibilities.
 These sheets are available on the APVMA website.
 What are pesticides?
 A pesticide is any substance or mixture of substances used to destroy, suppress or alter the life cycle of any pest.
 For a legal definition and more detailed information see DECC's What are pesticides and how do they work?
 webpage.
 Department of Environment and Climate Change (NSW) (NSW)
 In NSW the Pesticides Act 1999 requires the users of registered pesticides to strictly follow the approved label or permit directions.
 The Department of Environment and Climate Change (DECC) enforces the proper use of pesticides in NSW, including those used in agriculture, on public lands and on domestic and commercial premises; but not including veterinary chemicals, which are regulated by the Department of Primary Industries.
 The DECC has hundreds of officers who are authorised to enforce the provisions of the Pesticides Act.
 The DECC also provides guidance, through education programs and audits, and by facilitating communication among different stakeholder groups, to help pesticide users improve their management of pesticides.
 Many pesticides, because of their flammability, combustibility or toxicity, are classified as dangerous goods.
 While dangerous goods are being transported on public roads, they are regulated by the DECC under the Road and Rail Transport (Dangerous Goods) Act 1997.
 WorkCover NSW regulates the transport of dangerous goods on private roads.
 Under the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (POEO Act), the DECC regulates general pollution and waste matters in NSW.
 This control also applies to pesticides.
 For example, fish kills caused by pesticide residues in waterways are generally investigated under the POEO Act.
 The DECC evaluates the impacts of chemicals, including pesticides, on organisms and the environment through the Centre for Ecotoxicology, which is part of a cooperative research venture with the University of Technology Sydney.
 WorkCover NSW NSW
 Under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (OHS Act), WorkCover NSW seeks to protect workers in the workplace.
 Regulations under the OHS Act control hazardous substances including most (though not all) pesticides.
 The Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 2001 is the most recent and important of these.
 It covers identification of hazardous substances in the workplace and the assessment and control of risks associated with their use.
 To help industries implement the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 2001, WorkCover NSW has developed the Safe Use and Storage of Chemicals (Including Pesticides and Herbicides) in Agriculture Code of Practice 2006, and the Safe Use of Pesticides, Including Herbicides in Non-agricultural Workplaces Code of Practice 2006.
 These codes are a practical guide to the standard of health, safety and welfare required by this Regulation and the OHS Act.
 Under the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 2001, WorkCover NSW also licences and regulates pest management technicians (pest control operators) and commercial users of certain pesticide fumigants.
 Some pesticides are classified as dangerous goods because they are flammable or combustible liquids, or because of their toxicity.
 WorkCover NSW is responsible for regulating the classification, packaging, labelling, use and storage of dangerous goods.
 It is also responsible for regulating the transport of dangerous goods on private roads.
 (The transport of dangerous goods on public roads is regulated by the DECC.) DECC.)
 For information on the safe use of pesticides and occupational health and safety see the WorkCover website.
 NSW Health Health
 NSW Health advises on and assesses health-related pesticides incidents.
 The Environmental Health Branch of NSW Health is involved with the general policy aspects of chemicals (including pesticides) and health.
 NSW Health also works with the Australian Centre for Agricultural Health and Safety, Moree, which focuses on agricultural health and pesticide matters.
 NSW Health laboratories test for pesticide contamination in drinking water samples, in accordance with the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines.
 The Pharmaceutical Services Branch of NSW Health administers legislation on scheduled poisons with respect to the national requirements for the labelling and packaging of scheduled pesticides for domestic use.
 These requirements are outlined in the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing Therapeutic Goods Administration publication, Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons.
 NSW Food Authority Authority
 Under the NSW Food Act 2003, the NSW Food Authority routinely monitors results of pesticide and other chemical samples submitted by food companies to ensure compliance with the Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Code.
 The NSW Food Authority also contributes to the Australian Total Diet Survey, which monitors the amount of pesticides and contaminants present in food and estimates their intake in the diets of Australians.
 NSW Department of Primary Industries Industries
 The NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) regulates veterinary chemicals (under the Stock Medicines Act 1989) and stock foods (under the Stock Foods Act 1940 and the Stock (Chemical Residues) Act 1975).
 It also administers the Noxious Weeds Act 1993 and the Rural Lands Protection Act 1998.
 For more information see DECC's chemical managment page and/or visit the DPI website.
 NSW DPI provides advice on the use of farm chemicals in agricultural production, including information on integrated pest-management systems that can minimise the use of pesticides and other farm chemicals.
 The DPI, through the Livestock Health and Pest Authorities (formerly Rural Lands Protection Boards) network, also provides training and advice and oversees the use of poisons for the control of feral pest animals.
 NSW DPI publications, Primefacts and factsheets, contain information on a range of agricultural topics including the use of farm chemicals.
 Local government agencies agencies
 Local Government councils have planning, regulatory, management, research and/or monitoring roles relevant to pesticides.
 Local councils and some county councils are responsible for noxious weed control within local government areas and have an important role in zoning for appropriate adjacent land uses under local environmental plans (LEPs) and other planning mechanisms.
 Important non-government information sources sources
 Many industry groups, chemical suppliers, and community and environment organisations have useful information on managing and using pesticides.
 The agricultural and veterinary chemicals industry program, Agsafe, accredits agricultural and veterinary chemical supply premises and staff, and may impose sanctions where accreditation obligations are not met.
 Commercial resellers of agricultural and veterinary chemicals must have Agsafe-trained staff who are bound by an industry code of conduct to issue responsible and professional advice.
 Agsafe also coordinates a program of managing waste farm-chemical containers, in collaboration with the National Farmers' Federation, the Australian Local Government Association, and agricultural and veterinary chemical supply associations.
 The Livestock Health and Pest Authorities (formerly Rural Lands Protection Boards) are responsible for the control of pest animals, and for the supply and distribution of pesticides for vertebrate pests, plague locusts and wingless grasshoppers.
 The detection and control of plague locusts is coordinated on a national basis by the Australian Plague Locust Commission.
 There are many interest groups, community-based organisations and environment groups with expertise in pesticide matters.
 Examples include local and peak environment groups, organic growers associations and organisations representing pesticide user groups such as urban pest controllers and aerial applicators applicators

 What is it?
 �The non-pesticidal uses of six substances on the DSL were assessed under CEPA 1999.
 �All six substances are pesticides regulated by Health Canada under the Pest Control Products Act (PCPA):
 trifluralin, atrazine, chlorothalonil, chlorophacinone, methoxychlor, pentachlorophenol.
 How is it used?
 �All six substances are registered, or have been registered as active ingredients in pest control products under the PCPA and have undergone a rigorous scientific risk assessment.
 �Before a pesticide is allowed to be used or sold in Canada, the Government must be reasonably certain that no harm will occur to environment or health when pesticides are used according to label directions.
 �No uses or releases other than those covered by the PCPA have been identified in Canada for the six substances.
 Why did the Government of Canada assess it?
 �The six substances were identified as a potential concern for the environment based on their hazardous properties; some can stay in the environment for a long time, and some can also harm animals or plants that live in the water.
 �The Government of Canada followed the standard approach for registered pesticides on the Domestic Substances List (DSL) of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999) by collecting information pertaining to potential non-pesticidal releases and sources.
 How is it released into the environment?
 �Based on the data available, the six substances are not entering the environment from non-pesticidal uses.
 �Any releases to the environment from pesticidal uses have been assessed under the PCPA.
 What is the Government of Canada doing?
 �The Government of Canada has conducted a science-based evaluation of the six substances called a screening assessment.
 �The approach of the screening assessment under CEPA 1999 was to search for information on non-pesticidal releases and sources of the substances in relevant databases and on the internet, and review the findings.
 No information was found indicating non-pesticidal uses or releases in Canada.
 �Since no uses or releases other than those covered by the PCPA were identified in Canada for the six substances, the decisions on the hazardous properties of the six substances remained unchanged.
 It has been determined that the six substances are not currently harmful to the environment in Canada because exposure from non-pesticidal sources is expected to be low.
 �Two of the pesticides, atrazine and chlorophacinone, were recently re-evaluated under the PCPA, resulting in continued registration for specific uses.
 Three of the pesticides are currently undergoing re-evaluation (trifluralin, chlorothalonil and pentachlorophenol).
 All pesticidal uses of methoxychlor have been discontinued since December 31, 2005, and this substance is no longer registered under the PCPA.
 �Given the hazardous properties of these substances, there is concern that new non-pesticidal activities for the substances which have not been identified or assessed under CEPA 1999, could lead to the substances becoming harmful to the environment.
 The Government of Canada will therefore implement a Significant New Activity or SNAc provision for the six substances.
 This would require that any proposed new use of any of the six substances be subject to further assessment prior to the new activity.
 What should Canadians do?
 �Because exposure to the six substances is very low, Canadians do not need to take specific actions to reduce their exposure.
 �Canadians should always read and follow safety instructions provided on product labels.
 Pesticide Registration Section Section
 The Pesticide Registration Section registers federally accepted (FIFRA) pesticides that are distributed, sold, or offered for sale in Florida as stipulated in Chapter 487, Florida Statutes (F.S.) and Chapter 5E-2, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.).
 State law requires biennial registration renewal for each pesticide product sold/distributed in Florida.
 Pesticides not requiring federal approval must also be registered in Florida to assure adherence with State law.
 Petitions for emergency exemptions from federal registration are also reviewed and processed by the Section and submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for action.
 Special registration actions for new active ingredients, special local needs, significant new uses, and experimental use permits are processed through the Section.
 The Registration Section is responsible for the security of registration-related Confidential Business Information and serves as the Department�s repository for information relating to pesticide registrations.
 To accomplish our mission, members of the Section consult with specialists within the Department and other state and federal agencies, commissions and councils.
 Pesticide Product Definition Definition
 A pesticide is defined in Chapter 487.021(49) as "any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any insects, rodents, nematodes, fungi, weeds, or other forms of plant or animal life or viruses, except viruses, bacteria, or fungi on or in living humans or other animals, which the department by rule declares to be a pest, and any substance or mixture of substances intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant; however, the term "pesticide" does not include any article that:
 (a) Is a "new animal drug" within the meaning of s.201(w) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; Act;
 (b) Has been determined by the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services not to be a new animal drug by a regulation establishing conditions of use for the article; or or
 (c) Is an animal feed within the meaning of s.201(x) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act bearing or containing an article covered in this subsection." subsection."
 Plant regulators must be registered in Florida and are defined by Chapter 487.021(51) as "any substance or mixture of substances intended, through physiological action, for accelerating or retarding the rate of growth or maturation, or for otherwise altering the behavior, of ornamental or crop plants or the produce thereof; but does not include substances intended as plant nutrients, trace elements, nutritional chemicals, plant inoculants, or soil amendments." amendments."
 Devices do not require registration in Florida.
 Chapter 487.021(22) defines a device as "any instrument or contrivance (other than a firearm) which is intended for trapping, destroying, repelling, or mitigating, any pest or other form of plant or animal life (other than human and other than bacteria, virus, or other microorganism on or in living humans or other living animals); but not including equipment used for the application of pesticides when sold separately." Note also that Chapter 487.025(1) states:
 "A pesticide or device is misbranded if its labeling bears any statement, design, or graphic representation which is false or misleading in any particular." The specifics of each question on pesticide devices usually require a conversation with one of the Section's Registration Product Coordinators.
 [If you are unsure as to whether a product requires registration as a pesticide in Florida, contact one of the appropriate Registration Product Coordinators.] Coordinators.]
 Registration Requirements Requirements
 Please note these links will open the page in a new window.
 Generally, if a product is defined as a pesticide and is distributed, sold, or offered for sale in Florida, it must be registered by the Registration Section.
 Chapter 487.041, F.S.
 states:
 "Every pesticide which is distributed, sold, or offered for sale, except as provided in this section, within this state or delivered for transportation or transported in intrastate commerce or between points within this state or delivered for transportation or transported in intrastate commerce or between points within this state through any point outside this state shall be registered in the office of the department, and such registration shall be renewed biennially." biennially."
 As a general rule, any product registered as a pesticide with EPA will require registration in Florida, subject to the above.
 This includes experimental-use permits unless exempted as stipulated under Florida's Procedural Guidelines, Section VI (pdf).
 If a product is classified by the EPA as an "Exempt Pesticide" under FIFRA, section 25(b) (pdf), it must be registered in Florida under the Florida policy for �Exempted Pesticide Products� (pdf).
 Termiticides Registered in Florida for Preventive Treatment of New Construction Construction
 The Department adopted the Termiticide Efficacy Rule (pdf) (5E-2.0311, F.A.C.) on March 23, 2003.
 This rule requires termiticide registrants to provide efficacy data in support of the registration of their termiticide products intended for new construction in Florida.
 The Department maintains a table indicating the status of termiticides (pdf) that are being or have been evaluated under the rule requirements.
 Registration Application Procedures Procedures
 In order to register a new or amended pesticide product brand in the State of Florida an applicant/registrant is required to submit specific documents and a fee (checks, money order, credit cards) for the Department�s review and acceptance.
 A registration confirmation letter will be sent via email / fax / U.S.
 mail to the Registrant when the pesticide product brand-has been accepted for registration in Florida with an effective and expiration date.
 Florida Registered Pesticide Products Products
 The Pesticide Registration Section maintains a database of all pesticide product brands accepted for registration in the State and maintains copies of all accepted labeling associated with these registered pesticide product brands.
 The state maintains over 15,000 pesticide product brand records.

 Regular meetings of the Committee take place the first Thursday of each month at 9:00 a.m.
 These meetings are held in the Bureau of Pesticides Conference Room, Building #6, 3125 Conner Boulevard, Tallahassee, FL 32399-1650.

 Experts want the weedkiller paraquat - poison of choice in many suicide attempts - to be added to a 'watch list' of dangerous substances.
 Why then is Syngenta fighting the proposals asks Keith Tyrell?
 Last week, without fanfare, and largely unnoticed by the press, the world moved one step closer to calling time on a substance that has been blamed for tens of thousands of deaths worldwide every year.
 In a small meeting room in Rome, the Chemical Review Committee of the Rotterdam PIC Convention recommended that products containing the weedkiller paraquat in volumes 20 per cent or above be added to the list of chemicals covered by the treaty.
 This seemingly minor amendment could massively limit the use of the pesticide.
 Paraquat is one of the deadliest pesticides available in the world today.
 It is responsible for a huge proportion of the more than 250,000 deaths that occur from pesticide poisoning every year.
 The vast majority of these deaths are suicides.
 Paraquat is chosen precisely because it is so deadly and because � above a certain concentration � there is no effective antidote.
 As little as a mouthful of 20 per cent solution paraquat is likely to cause death.
 And accidental and occupational poisonings are also common.
 Inhalation and even skin contact are important pathways for poisoning and intoxication of farmworkers is common wherever it is used.
 Death by paraquat poisoning is slow and painful.
 Soon after swallowing, sufferers will experience lesions and pains in the mouth and stomach, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and blood in faeces.
 Within two to three days they will see reduced urine volume and jaundice, a cough, difficulty in breathing, lung oedema (swelling), convulsions, coma and finally death.
 But it can take weeks for this to occur.
 Examining pesticide abuses in Sri Lanka in 2007, researchers Andrew Dawson and Nick Buckley came across this tragic, but all too common case:
 �Late last year in a hospital (...), there was a 16�year old girl who had swallowed a mouthful of paraquat immediately following an argument with her parents.
 The paraquat had been stored inside her house.
 She was cyanosed and apparently within hours or days of death, having suffered a fortnight of steadily increasing breathlessness.
 She could not eat or sleep because of dyspnoea, and even had difficulty drinking.
 She was frightened and no longer wished to die, if indeed she had ever wanted to�.
 Sri Lanka has since banned paraquat.
 The decision to recommend the addition of paraquat to the Rotterdam Convention list was fought tooth and nail by Swiss chemical giant Syngenta � which has a more than three quarters market share of paraquat sales.
 It has lobbied hard to keep the pesticide out of the treaty, and is likely to continue to do so in the coming months.
 But why was the multinational so keen to stop the listing of paraquat in an obscure treaty that technically only requires countries to share information about the chemicals, and for importers to give 'prior informed consent'?
 The answer is that, in practice, many developing countries see inclusion as a green light to banning the import of substances.
 What is more, many retailers use the Convention to decide which pesticides to restrict in their supply chains.
 At the moment, the Co-op and Marks and Spencer are the only major UK retailers to have taken steps to restrict the use of paraquat by their suppliers.
 If it is listed, we can expect all of the big supermarkets to come under pressure to follow suit.
 But while the Committee�s recommendation is good news, it only applies products with more than 20 per cent concentration of paraquat and it has yet to be ratified by all of the Parties to the treaty � this won�t happen before 2013 � leaving a window for manufacturers to increase their lobbying efforts and block the move.
 In the meantime tens of thousands of people could die.
 Since the existence of pesticide regulation in Europe (Directive 91/414), no strict criteria were used for approving pesticides in Europe (put on Annex I, the positive list).
 Anything could get an approval.
 Voting by national representatives (a difficult system with �qualified majorities� and �blocking minorities�) in the Standing Committee determined the outcome.
 No matter if a pesticide was a carcinogen of a full PBT (persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic) according to the Stockholm convention, an EU-approval was possible.
 This will change once the new pesticide Regulation 1107/2009 is used.
 While not quite ideal (EU decisions are by nature a compromise), for the first time we have strict criteria for pesticides, the so-called �cut-off� criteria.
 For human health these �cut-off�criteria are shown below, Annex II, 3.6.2 to 3.6.5:
 3.6.2.
 An active substance, safener or synergist shall only be approved if, on the basis of assessment of higher tier genotoxicity testing carried out in accordance with the data requirements for the active substances, safeners or synergists and other available data and information, including a review of the scientific literature, reviewed by the Authority, it is not or has not to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as mutagen category 1A or 1B.
 EN 24.11.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 309/41 309/41
 3.6.3.
 An active substance, safener or synergist shall only be approved, if, on the basis of assessment of carcinogenicity testing carried out in accordance with the data requirements for the active substances, safener or synergist and other available data and information, including a review of the scientific literature, reviewed by the Authority, it is not or has not to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as carcinogen category 1A or 1B, unless the exposure of humans to that active substance, safener or synergist in a plant protection product, under realistic proposed conditions of use, is negligible, that is, the product is used in closed systems or in other conditions excluding contact with humans and where residues of the active substance, safener or synergist concerned on food and feed do not exceed the default value set in accordance with Article 18(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.
 3.6.4.
 An active substance, safener or synergist shall only be approved if, on the basis of assessment of reproductive toxicity testing carried out in accordance with the data requirements for the active substances, safeners or synergists and other available data and information, including a review of the scientific literature, reviewed by the Authority, it is not or has not to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as toxic for reproduction category 1A or 1B, unless the exposure of humans to that active substance, safener or synergist in a plant protection product, under realistic proposed conditions of use, is negligible, that is, the product is used in closed systems or in other conditions excluding contact with humans and where residues of the active substance, safener or synergist concerned on food and feed do not exceed the default value set in accordance with point (b) of Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.
 3.6.5.
 An active substance, safener or synergist shall only be approved if, on the basis of the assessment of Community or internationally agreed test guidelines or other available data and information, including a review of the scientific literature, reviewed by the Authority, it is not considered to have endocrine disrupting properties that may cause adverse effect in humans, unless the exposure of humans to that active substance, safener or synergist in a plant protection product, under realistic proposed conditions of use, is negligible, that is, the product is used in closed systems or in other conditions excluding contact with humans and where residues of the active substance, safener or synergist concerned on food and feed do not exceed the default value set in accordance with point (b) of Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.
 By 14 December 2013, the Commission shall present to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health a draft of the measures concerning specific scientific criteria for the determination of endocrine disrupting properties to be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 79(4).
 Pending the adoption of these criteria, substances that are or have to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as carcinogenic category 2 and toxic for reproduction category 2, shall be considered to have endocrine disrupting properties.
 In addition, substances such as those that are or have to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as toxic for reproduction category 2 and which have toxic effects on the endocrine organs, may be considered to have such endocrine disrupting properties.
 Derogations can be granted in case there are no alternatives (defined in Art.
 4.7).
 For the environment, the criteria are PBT or POP as defined in Annex II, 3.7 (not shown here).
 A big debate has been running for quite some time how many pesticides would fall �victim� to these cut-off criteria.
 Chemical industry, supported by UK government body PSD (now HSE) were quick to say 85% of the active substances would disappear.
 Others like Commission and Member State Sweden estimated a maximum of 5% of the pesticides would be banned with these criteria.
 Sweden also presented a list of 23 active substances they felt would be banned.

 Types of PesticidesPesticides are often referred to according to the type of pest they control.
 Another way to think about pesticides is to consider those that are chemical pesticides or are derived from a common source or production method.
 Other categories include biopesticides, antimicrobials, and pest control devices.
 Chemical Pesticides Pesticides
 Some examples of chemically-related pesticides follow.
 Other examples are available in sources such as Recognition and Management of Pesticide Poisonings.
 Organophosphate Pesticides - These pesticides affect the nervous system by disrupting the enzyme that regulates acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter.
 Most organophosphates are insecticides.
 They were developed during the early 19th century, but their effects on insects, which are similar to their effects on humans, were discovered in 1932.
 Some are very poisonous (they were used in World War II as nerve agents).
 However, they usually are not persistent in the environment.
 Carbamate Pesticides affect the nervous system by disupting an enzyme that regulates acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter.
 The enzyme effects are usually reversible.
 There are several subgroups within the carbamates.
 Organochlorine Insecticides were commonly used in the past, but many have been removed from the market due to their health and environmental effects and their persistence (e.g.
 DDT and chlordane).
 Pyrethroid Pesticides were developed as a synthetic version of the naturally occurring pesticide pyrethrin, which is found in chrysanthemums.
 They have been modified to increase their stability in the environment.
 Some synthetic pyrethroids are toxic to the nervous system.
 Biopesticides Biopesticides
 Biopesticides are certain types of pesticides derived from such natural materials as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals.
 For example, canola oil and baking soda have pesticidal applications and are considered biopesticides.
 At the end of 2001, there were approximately 195 registered biopesticide active ingredients and 780 products.
 Biopesticides fall into three major classes:
 (1) Microbial pesticides consist of a microorganism (e.g., a bacterium, fungus, virus or protozoan) as the active ingredient.
 Microbial pesticides can control many different kinds of pests, although each separate active ingredient is relatively specific for its target pest[s].
 For example, there are fungi that control certain weeds, and other fungi that kill specific insects.
 The most widely used microbial pesticides are subspecies and strains of Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt.
 Each strain of this bacterium produces a different mix of proteins, and specifically kills one or a few related species of insect larvae.
 While some Bt's control moth larvae found on plants, other Bt's are specific for larvae of flies and mosquitoes.
 The target insect species are determined by whether the particular Bt produces a protein that can bind to a larval gut receptor, thereby causing the insect larvae to starve starve
 (2) Plant-Incorporated-Protectants (PIPs) are pesticidal substances that plants produce from genetic material that has been added to the plant.
 For example, scientists can take the gene for the Bt pesticidal protein, and introduce the gene into the plant's own genetic material.
 Then the plant, instead of the Bt bacterium, manufactures the substance that destroys the pest.
 The protein and its genetic material, but not the plant itself, are regulated by EPA.
 (3) Biochemical pesticides are naturally occurring substances that control pests by non-toxic mechanisms.
 Conventional pesticides, by contrast, are generally synthetic materials that directly kill or inactivate the pest.
 Biochemical pesticides include chemicals, such as insect sex pheromones, that interfere with mating, as well as various scented plant extracts that attract insect pests to traps.
 Because it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a substance meets the criteria for classification as a biochemical pesticide, EPA has established a special committee to make such decisions.
 Pest Types Types

 Desiccants Desiccants
 Promote drying of living tissues, such as unwanted plant tops.
 Insect growth regulators regulators
 Disrupt the molting, maturity from pupal stage to adult, or other life processes of insects.
 Plant growth regulators regulators
 Substances (excluding fertilizers or other plant nutrients) that alter the expected growth, flowering, or reproduction rate of plants.
 Pest Control Devices Devices
 What about pest control devices?
 EPA also has a role in regulating devices used to control pests.
 More specifically, a "device" is any instrument or contrivance (other than a firearm) intended for trapping, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest.
 A mousetrap is an example of a device.
 Unlike pesticides, EPA does not require devices to be registered with the Agency.
 Devices are subject to certain labeling, packaging, record keeping, and import/export requirements, however.
 For more information on devices, see Pest Control Devices.

 A pesticide is any substance intended to prevent, destroy or repel pests.
 Though often misunderstood to refer only to insecticides, the term pesticide also applies to herbicides and fungicides.
 The following are more specific types:
 "Herbicide," a substance that kills plants/weeds.
 "Insecticide," a substance that kills insects.
 "Fungicide," a substance that kills fungi.
 "Rodenticide," a substance that kills rodents.
 For more, go to http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/.
 Pesticides could harm your health and the environment if not handled properly.
 Always read and follow the directions on the pesticide label.
 In addition, pesticide users must know the hazards of the product before applying.
 If a weed product is toxic to fish, make sure it stays out of nearby fish ponds or streams.
 If a product is toxic to honey bees, don't use in areas where honey bees forage.
 Aerosol products and foggers should not be used around people with asthma or other breathing problems.

 Approval of Commodity Substances - An Introduction Introduction
 Commodity substances are chemicals which have a variety of non-pesticide uses and as well as minor uses as pesticides.
 If such a substance is to be used as a pesticide, it requires approval under the Control of Pesticides Regulations (COPR), and is granted approval for use only.
 Sale, supply, storage and advertisement of a commodity substance as a pesticide is an offence unless specific approval has been granted for the substance to be marketed as a pesticide under an approved label.
 Anyone wishing to sell, supply, store or advertise any of these substances specifically as pesticides has to seek specific approval under COPR.
 Information about the status of commodity substances for plant protection and biocidal uses are given below.
 The approval schedule detailing the conditions of use which a user must follow when using the commodity substance can be viewed by clicking on the substance name.
 Plant Protection Uses Uses
 Currently approved commodity substances substances
 The following substances were added to Annex I of Directive 91/414/EEC via Commission Directive 2008/127/EC.
 New EU legislation for plant protection products (Regulation (EC) No.
 1107/2009) replaced Directive 91/414/EEC from 14 June 2011.
 These substances have since been transferred to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, which implements Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 regarding the list of approved active substances.
 Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No.
 1107/2009 introduces harmonised arrangements for approval of commodity substances, which are known as �basic substances� in the EU regime.
 We will issue further advice on the possible approval of these commodity substances as basic substances when they are reviewed / renewed.
 A pesticide is any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest.
 Pests can be insects, mice and other animals, unwanted plants (weeds), fungi, or microorganisms like bacteria and viruses.
 Though often misunderstood to refer only to insecticides, the term pesticide also applies to herbicides, fungicides, and various other substances used to control pests.
 Under United States law, a pesticide is also any substance or mixture of substances intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant.
 Many household products are pesticides.
 Did you know that all of these common products are considered pesticides?
 Cockroach sprays and baits baits
 Insect repellents for personal use.
 Rat and other rodent poisons.
 Flea and tick sprays, powders, and pet collars.
 Kitchen, laundry, and bath disinfectants and sanitizers.
 Products that kill mold and mildew.
 Some lawn and garden products, such as weed killers.
 Some swimming pool chemicals.
 By their very nature, most pesticides create some risk of harm to humans, animals, or the environment because they are designed to kill or otherwise adversely affect living organisms.
 In the United States, the Office of Pesticide Programs of the Environmental Protection Agency is chiefly responsible for regulating pesticides.
 Biologically-based pesticides, such as pheromones and microbial pesticides, are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides.
 Here are some common kinds of pesticides and their function:
 Algicides Algicides

 More specifically, a "device" is any instrument or contrivance (other than a firearm) intended for trapping, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest.
 A mousetrap is an example of a device.
 Unlike pesticides, EPA does not require devices to be registered with the Agency.
 Devices are subject to certain labeling, packaging, record keeping, and import/export requirements, however.
 What is not a pesticide?
 The U.S.
 definition of pesticides is quite broad, but it does have some exclusions:
 Drugs used to control diseases of humans or animals (such as livestock and pets) are not considered pesticides; such drugs are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.
 Fertilizers, nutrients, and other substances used to promote plant survival and health are not considered plant growth regulators and thus are not pesticides.
 Biological control agents, except for certain microorganisms, are exempted from regulation by EPA.
 (Biological control agents include beneficial predators such as birds or ladybugs that eat insect pests.) pests.)
 Finally, EPA has also exempted certain other low-risk substances, such as cedar chips, garlic, and mint oil.

 Since August 2002, EFSA has been responsible for the EU peer review of active substances used in plant protection products.
 This task is carried out by EFSA�s Pesticide Risk Assessment Peer Review Unit in line with procedures and deadlines set out in EU legislation.
 Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market states that active substances in pesticides are only approved for use in the EU if they have undergone a safety assessment.
 The Directive required a review by the end of 2009 of all active substances that were on the market in the EU by 1993.
 The substances covered by the review programme are often referred to as existing substances since they were on the market at the time the legislation entered into force.
 So called new substances that have been placed on the market since July 1993 are also assessed following the same procedures.
 The evaluation of both existing and new active substances is done through a tiered approach:
 1.For each substance an initial draft risk assessment report (DAR) is produced by a designated Member State, State,
 2.followed by a peer review by EFSA in cooperation with all Member States, States,
 3.leading to a legislative decision whether or not to include the substance in the Union�s list of approved active substances (Regulation EC 1107/2009).
 �Directive 91/414/EEC 91/414/EEC
 How we work work
 For the review of each active substance pesticide manufacturers or marketing companies have to submit a file containing required scientific information and studies in accordance with EU legislation.
 Information and support concerning the status of the active substance or general guidance are available from EFSA�s Applications Helpdesk.
 �Helpdesk:
 Pesticide evaluation requests requests
 A Member State is appointed rapporteur with the job of carrying out an initial risk assessment based on the file, according to agreed evaluation procedures, and preparing a Draft Assessment Report (DAR).
 If no file is provided or if it lacks required information, the European Commission may take necessary steps to remove the substance from the market.
 The DARs are then provided to EFSA for a peer review:
 1.The DAR is made publicly available on the EFSA website for a 40-day public consultation allowing for comments comments
 2.Scientists from the PRAPeR Unit and the Member States comprehensively peer review the DAR in order to guarantee the highest possible standards.
 If necessary, discussions between expert scientists from the regulatory authorities of the Member States also take place.
 All available public DARs can be accessed at any time on the EFSA website.
 EFSA then drafts conclusions summarising the outcome of the peer review process, which are sent to the Commission and published on the EFSA website.
 Taking into account EFSA�s conclusions, the Commission and the Member States take a decision on whether or not to include an active substance in the list on authorised active substances (Annex I of Directive 91/414/EEC).
 This determines whether the substance can be used in a plant protection product in the EU.
 The Member States also take decisions at national level on whether individual products with specific use recommendations remain on the market in their countries.
 Abstract Abstract
 Life has migrated to land from water.
 It is time to return to the Oceans for our food and energy needs.
 LIFE farms demand a holistic pattern of land use which integrates natural regulation processes. 
This helps to reduce the need for off-farm inputs such as pesticides. 
Crop rotation, cultivation and soil management, cultivars resistant to pests and diseases, sowing date, nutrition, biodiversity, as well as pesticides are used for pest control and are all important parts of integrated farming systems.
 Pesticides and other farm inputs have received scant attention from marine biologists and industry researchers alike.
 Seaweeds are typical examples of such neglect.
 Their industrial, consumer, and pharmaceutical uses have been developed far beyond applications to raise agricultural productivity.
 Observations of the practices of indigenous communities indicate that marine algae could be versatile sources for raising farm outputs.
 We have a similar case with respect to copying marine eco-systems for pest management on land.
 Aquatic worms have inspired a few active substances, but attempts to map all the natural pesticide substances that abound in fresh, estuarine, and pelagic waters, are almost non-existent.
 Integration between marine biologists, pesticide developers, and analytic chemists, can improve the present inventory of pesticides, nutrients, and other useful agricultural inputs that we can source from the earth�s vast water bodies.
 Pesticides and Other Farm Inputs as Poor Cousins of the Seas Seas
 The Nereid types of aquatic animals have inspired a select number of active substances with pesticide properties.
 However the Oceans and vast inland water bodies of earth have not inspired the kind of pesticide revolution which we find with respect to terrestrial plants such as pyrethrum.
 All significant herbal pesticides and structures based on natural pesticides have been drawn from life forms on land.
 Pesticides are an exception in this respect, because natural marine and aquatic treasures have found a host of other applications.
 This is probably because marine biologists and pesticide developers have rarely worked together.
 All initiatives to harvest products and resources from the sea or from inland waters require the coordination of variegated disciplines.
 This starts with the simple profession of fishing, in which carpentry, navigation, engineering, and biology must all come together for commercially viable landings.
 The situation is far more complicated when it comes to mining ocean floors for minerals and energy sources.
 Aquatic animal life forms have primordial precursors of nervous systems that have evolved in insects.
 There is also strong competition between plant forms in some aquatic habitats.
 Therefore inland waters and the sea must be rich in natural pesticides.
 However, almost all this potential remains untapped to this day.
 Hints of Vast Natural Pesticide and Farm Inputs in Our Oceans Oceans
 Indigenous people have used marine extracts as natural pesticides since ancient times.
 The earliest record of such activity belongs to the Greek civilization.
 This relates to the use of the active substance of a sting ray for medical procedures.
 Marine biologists have recorded large numbers of these fierce but poorly understood animals that can paralyze their prey almost instantly.
 No work has been done on the physiology of the toxin.
 The structures involved have not been studied.
 They have not been used to synthesize novel chemicals.
 The situation with respect to sea snakes is a little better.
 Chemical structures in venom have been analyzed, but their pesticide potentials have not been studied thoroughly.
 This could be because most of the research has been from a medical perspective, looking for ways to treat people attacked by sea snakes.
 Corals and seaweeds have been observed to have pesticide-like properties.
 Cultivators in the Philippines have used seaweed extracts for generations.
 However, chemists have been satisfied with cursory studies of extracts.
 These have failed to segregate and identify specific active substances.
 Similarly, marine biologists are aware that coral colonies are able to immobilize some life forms through natural pesticides.
 However, there have virtually been no attempts to study the molecular structures involved, or to use them as templates for new pest control extracts.
 Seaweeds and Agronomy Agronomy
 Seaweeds are used for a variety of agricultural and other commercial purposes.
 Their gelling properties are considered to be most useful.
 Therefore, nutrition, pharmaceutical, and food processing industries have emerged as the most prolific users of seaweeds.
 Overall, use of this abundant natural resource does not match its versatility in all kinds of waters.
 Less than six species are used on commercial scales, though it is known that large numbers inhabit different waters at various points of the globe.
 Chemists know that seaweeds are rich repositories of all kinds of natural extracts, but efforts to study modes of action and spectra of activities have been lacking.
 Seaweeds are so prolific in growth that some communities struggle to keep their numbers under control.
 Japan leads the world in using the nutritional strengths of seaweeds in diet, but food shortages and health concerns have not stirred other people to follow suit.
 Even commercial harvesting is strangely restricted.
 The Bay of Bengal for example, is used far more for seaweed harvests than the coastlines of the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.
 Fisher folk do not have access to markets, with the result that they forego opportunities to enhance their earnings.
 The use of seaweed extracts in agriculture is very sparse compared to its potential and benefits.
 Strategies for New Pesticides and Other Farm Inputs from Waters Waters
 All natural substances produced by predatory aquatic life forms deserve study.
 The work needs to be decentralized because fresh waters, estuaries, and pelagic areas may harbor entirely different species.
 Extracts should be broken down in to discrete elements and evaluated separately.
 Some lower orders of life can be cultivated for commercial quantities of extracts, whereas others may have to be copied for synthetic processes.
 All related development work will need government and non-government organizational sponsorships because chemical pesticide companies may hesitate to take up such work.
 Pharmacognosy principles will help administrators and public researchers find the most probable leads.
 Conclusions Conclusions
 Seaweed extracts in nutrition, pharmaceutical, and processed foods, should encourage us to think of all the benefits to be had by detailed mapping of natural substances produced by aquatic plants and animals.
 There is immense scope to strengthen the role of aquatic extracts in farm production.
 It is a suitable focus area for public bodies.
 Agrarian and fishing communities stand to gain the most.
 The gelling properties of seaweeds should be studied further for applications in management of scarce water resources.
 Encouragement for established seaweed products will be a positive first step.
 The environmental, social, and sustainability benefits of substituting agricultural chemicals with natural extracts from aquatic sources, should be kept in mind when forming national policies in this respect.
 During the war in Vietnam more than 18 million gallons of dioxin-laden Agent Orange and other herbicides were sprayed over ten per cent of South Vietnam between 1961 and 1971, poisoning and defoliating millions of hectares of forest and croplands.
 In neighbouring Laos about half-a-million gallons of herbicide were sprayed over 80,000 hectares.
 Professors Pfeiffer and Westing were the first two scientists to study the effects of Agent Orange spraying in Vietnam.
 Along with other scientists they contributed to the public pressure which put an end to the spraying in 1970.
 They are now informing the US public of the unwillingness of the US to join with its allies in funding crucial dioxin research in Vietnam.
 The indifference of the US is hardly surprising.
 As early as 1961 the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US Air Force warned that:
 'Care must be taken to assure that the US does not become the target for charges of employing chemical or biological warfare.
 International repercussions could be serious.' serious.'
 According to Pfeiffer the sprayings of Agent Orange and crop-destruction programmes were aimed at depriving the peasants of their food supply and forcing them to move to areas dominated by the South Vietnamese.
 By sustaining this policy of 'generating refugees' the Pentagon hoped to deny the national-liberation forces the peasants' support, leaving them without a rural society in which to live.
 In Hanoi the chief surgeon and director of the Viet Duc Hospital, Dr Ton That Tung, raised the alarm that contamination by the dioxin in Agent Orange was causing birth defects, liver cancer, chloracne and other health problems in southern Vietnam.
 He visited the US to gather support for a large-scale study of the population because:
 'My country does not have the resources to do it alone.' He testified before a Congressional committee, but it made little difference.
 However, scientists worldwide in co-operation with their Vietnamese colleagues have been gathering evidence that gives the lie to the Agent Orange cover-up.
 At Tu Du Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, doctors see a child born with a congenital defect about every day-and-a-half, down from one a day in the 1980s but still too high.
 A report in the American Journal of Public Health stated that dioxin levels in breastmilk in southern Vietnam were 50 times greater than in the unsprayed North.
 Calls for research into the effects of dioxin contamination in Vietnam are backed by the knowledge that it will help to deal with the threat posed by widespread prevalence of dioxins in the environment in the US and elsewhere.
 Dioxins are the most potent carcinogen ever tested and are produced as a by-product of heating or burning chlorine-based chemicals.
 The primary sources today are the pulp and paper industry, municipal and hospital wastes, incinerators, herbicide and pesticide producers and agricultural users.
 At present the US Government continues to shy away from funding research in Vietnam because it will mean admitting to chemical warfare.
 NERVE AGENTS, PESTICIDES, AND CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION INHIBITION
 by John S.
 Nordin, Ph.D.
 You have heard it in the news media.
 Iraq is believed to possess chemical warfare agents, in particular, nerve agents such as the deadly VX and Sarin.
 There is no question that Iraq has used chemical warfare agents in the past, but samples of suspicious material collected by the U.S.
 military in Iraq have shown to be various pesticides.
 Are the chemical warfare agents hidden some place, or carried out of Iraq, or were (as the old Iraq regime claimed) the agents destroyed?
 And how secure are those stockpiles of nerve agents stored in the former Soviet Union?
 The technologies and equipment used to manufacture pesticides are similar to those used to manufacture nerve gases.
 Some pesticides act by inhibiting the enzyme cholinesterase.
 Some chemical warfare agents (i.e.
 the nerve gases or agents) also act by inhibiting cholinesterase.
 Cholinesterase is an enzyme found in both humans, other animals, and insects.
 The enzyme is important in the functioning of the nervous system.
 There are differences between human and insect nerve transmission, and a goal in pesticide development is targeting the insect pests while leaving non-targeted species alone.
 Sarin was originally developed in Germany as a powerful pesticide for killing aphids.
 Pesticides on the market today are quite safe when used as directed, but workers who are in contact with certain pesticides should have their cholinesterase levels periodically checked.
 Deaths from pesticide poisoning still occur.
 Let us take a look at the subject of cholinesterase inhibition and those chemicals that cause cholinesterase inhibition.
 What is Cholinesterase Inhibition?
 Let�s take a look inside the human body.
 The human body, as well as other animals, contain electrical switching centers called �synapses�.
 The body manufactures a chemical called �acetylcholine� which turns on the switches and another enzyme called �acetylcholinesterase� which breaks down the acetylcholine and turns off the switches.
 All this happens very fast.
 This is how the brain signals information throughout the body, to control respiration, muscle action, digestion, and other life functions.
 Certain chemicals can throw this out of balance.
 A cholinesterase inhibiting chemical (nerve agents and some pesticides) interferes with the enzyme that breaks down the acetylcholine and excessive acetylcholine builds up at the synapses.
 There is nothing to switch off the synapses as acetylcholine builds up.
 Electrical impulses fire away continuously.
 Repeated and unchecked firing of electrical signals causes uncontrolled and rapid twitching of muscles, paralyzed breathing, convulsions, and in extreme cases, death.
 Any chemical that can bind, or inhibit, cholinesterase (e.g.
 acetylcholinesterase) making it unable to breakdown acetylcholine is called a �cholinesterase inhibitor�, or an �anticholinesterase agent�.
 The nerve agents (chemical warfare agents) are the most potent.
 Certain pesticides can also show some degree of cholinesterase inhibition.
 The pesticides that can result in cholinesterase inhibition fall into broad classifications of either (1) organophosphates or organophorphorous pesticides, (2) carbamate pesticides, or (3) pesticides based on chlorinated derivatives of nicotine.
 There are also many pesticides on the market that do not inhibit cholinesterase.
 The offending chemical can be ingested, absorbed through the skin or eyes, or inhaled.
 The amount of chemical required to kill a human being can be as little as one drop of agent VX applied on the skin.
 On the other hand, some of the pesticides, which possess cholinesterase inhibition are of low enough toxicity that it would be difficult for a person to poison himself.
 .
 Symptoms of Cholinesterase Inhibitation Inhibitation
 Mild Poisoning:
 Tiredness, weakness, dizziness, nausea, and blurred vision.
 Symptoms appear usually within 4 to 24 hours of exposure in the case of pesticides, sooner in the case of toxic nerve agents.
 Moderate Poisoning:
 Headache, sweating, tearing, drooling, vomiting, tunnel vision, and twitching.
 Symptoms appear usually within 4 to 24 hours of exposure in the case of pesticides, sooner in the case of nerve agents.
 Severe Poisoning (a single large dose or repeated smaller dosages):
 Abdominal cramps, involuntary urination and/or defecation, muscular tremors, staggering gait, pinpoint pupils, hypotension (drop in blood pressure), slow heartbeat, difficulty breathing, possible convulsions, possible coma, and possible death.
 Symptoms can appear within seconds (by inhalation) or minutes (skin contact) in the case of lethal doses of nerve agents.
 Some chemicals may also irritate the lining of the nose and respiratory tract, and in severe cases, result in pulmonary edema (filling of the lungs with fluid).
 Some of the symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition can be confused with influenza (flu), gastroenteritis, pneumonia, heat prostration, alcohol intoxication, drug overdose, exhaustion, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), asthma, or a brain hemorrhage, or even a heart attack.
 First responder and law enforcement officers responding to the incident need to piece together quickly the circumstances.
 Is only one person affected or do many people display symptoms?
 Are dead animals or birds or insects present?
 Is there a chemical nearby that might indicate poisoning?
 Does the person carry medications or have a diabetic bracelet?
 Has the person been doing heavy labor?
 Does the person feel hot?
 This information needs to be conveyed to medical personnel.
 Jane�s Chem-Bio Handbook (published by Jane�s Information Group, Alexandria Va, 1998) singles out three symptoms for first responders to look for in case of a mass nerve gas vapor exposure.
 These are (1) small pupils (miosis), (2) runny nose (rhinorrhea), and (3) shortness of breath.
 The pupils remain small even in dim light.
 Some casualties may have two of the effects, some will have only small pupils, some will have all three.
 A large concentration of vapor may also cause loss of consciousness and convulsions.
 If the vapor concentration is large enough, the symptoms may become apparent within a few seconds after inhalation.
 If a nerve agent liquid contacts the skin, symptoms may appear within a few minutes after contact to about 18 hours depending upon the agent and amount.
 Only one drop (10 mg) of the agent VX on the skin can kill.
 Initial symptoms include sweating and muscular twitching (fasciculations) at the site of the drop.
 Later symptoms (after several hours) may include nausea and vomiting, especially if the amount is larger.
 A lethal drop will, within minutes of contract, cause loss of consciousness, convulsions, cessation of respiration, and paralysis.
 Treatment Treatment
 The person should be transported to the hospital, poison center, or treatment location at the first sign of poisoning.
 Atropine (delivered by injection) is the antidote given when treating cholinesterase inhibition.
 A combination of Atropine and pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM or 2-PAMCl, Protopam) may be administered for organophosphate pesticide or nerve gas poisoning.
 Atropine blocks the effects of the neurotransmitter (the nerve gas or pesticide) that causes over stimulation.
 Pralidoxime chloride (2-PAMCl) is an oxime which removes the nerve agent or the organophosphate-based pesticide from the enzyme.
 Atropine is the only antidote for carbamate-based pesticide exposure.
 Fortunately, the breakdown of cholinesterase can be reversed by proper treatment.
 The MARK I kit supplied to military personnel consists of two spring-driven injectors:
 (1) 2 mg of atropine in 0.7 ml of diluent and (2) 600 mg of 2-PAMCl in 2 ml of diluent.
 Assisted breathing and supportive care will be required in cases of severe poisoning.
 The Jane�s Chem-Bio Handbook (published by Jane�s Information Group, Alexandria, VA, in 1998) adds the following details (applicable to both nerve agents and certain pesticides):
 Mild Poisoning:
 Usually no antidotes.
 However, if eye or head pain or nausea and vomiting (in absence of other symptoms) atropine/homatropine eye drops should be administered.
 Atropine only (2 mg) should be administered in the case of severe rhinorrhea (nasal discharge).
 Moderate Poisoning:
 Vomiting and/or diarrhea, and/or shortness of breath:
 For nerve gases and organophosphate pesticide poisoning administer 2 mg of Atropine and 600 mg of 2-PAMCl (if injecting, 1000 mg of 2-PAMCl over 20 to 30 minutes).
 Follow with additional atropine (2 mg) at 5 to 10 minutes until breathing is improved.
 Assisted ventilation and oxygen is recommended in the case of a casualty with cardiac or pulmonary disease but probably unnecessary in most other situations.
 Severe Poisoning:
 Convulsions, severe shortness of breath, unconscious, severe gastrointestinal effects, muscular twitching, or a combination of two or more of these symptoms.
 Administer 6 mg of Atropine by IM (not IV) and 1800 mg of 2-PAMCl (can be injected or alternatively by infusion of 1000 mg over 20 to 30 minutes).
 Administer diazepam (10 mg by IM or 5 to 10 mg slowly by IV).
 Diazepam is an antoconvulsant.
 Lorazepam may be administered instead of diazepam.
 Administer more atropine (2 mg at 5 to 10 mg slowly until improvement is noted.
 Administer more 2-PAMCl at hourly doses up to 3 doses.
 Atropine does not reverse miosis (pupal size) so this cannot be used as an indicator of atropine effectiveness.
 Atropine should be administrated before attempting to insert an endotrachael tube to reduce bronchoconstriction in the situation of intense airway resistance.
 Atropine at 6 mg dose should not be given by IV to a hypoxic patient because of the possibility of ventricular fibrillation.
 The initial dose must be given by IM.
 2-PAMCl if injected too rapidly (less than 20 minutes) can result in hypertension.
 Phentolamine (5 mg, by IV) will reverse the hypertension.
 In a normal adult without nerve gas or pesticide poisoning, 2 mg of atropine will cause an increase in heart rate of about 35 beats per minute which can be tolerated by someone without heart disease.
 Atropine given to an adult without nerve gas or pesticide poisoning also may result in blurred vision for 24 hours and drying of secretions (including sweat inhibition).
 The recommended starting dose for children between 2 and 10 years is 1 mg of atropine.
 For infants under 2 years, administer 0.5 mg.
 Is There a Test for Cholinesterase Inhibition?
 Workers who are routinely exposed to cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides (organophosphate and/or carbamate pesticides) should have their blood checked for cholinesterase activity.
 This is required by law by many states.
 This includes workers who service equipment.
 Federal regulations also require applicators to be tested when using pesticides in the �highly toxic� or �moderately toxic� category (EPA lists categories for pesticides).
 A baseline sample should be taken before employment (or taken during a time when the worker has not been exposed to organophosphate or carbamate pesticides for 30 days).
 At least two baseline samples should be taken.
 If later tests show a 20% decrease in cholinesterase level, he/she should be retested.
 If tests show a 30% or greater decrease, the worker must be removed from all exposure to organophosphate and carbamate pesticides.
 Humans have three types of cholinesterase:
 (1) red blood cell cholinesterase, (2) plasma cholinesterase, and (3) brain cholinesterase.
 When a blood sample is withdrawn, the patient�s red blood cell cholinesterase and plasma cholinesterase can be measured.
 Brain cholinesterase cannot be directly measured in a practical situation, but the same red blood cell cholinesterase enzyme is also in the nervous system Plasma cholinesterase, which is manufactured in the liver, is different from red blood cell cholinesterase.
 Plasma cholinesterase and red blood cell cholinesterase numbers have different meanings.
 Plasma cholinesterase numbers give an acute or early warning number while red blood cell cholinesterase numbers are useful in evaluating chronic, long-term exposure.
 Toxicity of Nerve Agents Agents
 Nerve agents can be absorbed into the body by inhalation, through the skin(including the eyes), or by ingestion.
 In a terrorist attack, the routes of entry will probably be through the skin or by inhalation.
 We will look at the toxicity of four nerve agents:
 (1) Sarin, also called GB; (2) Soman, also called GD; (3) Tabun, also called GA; and (4) O-ethyl-S-(2-diisopropylaminoethyl) methylphosphonothiolate , better known as VX.
 All are organophosphate compounds.
 These are not the only nerve agents in existence but the ones that are the most widely known.
 There are also chemical warfare agents that are not cholinesterase inhibitors; these include blister agents (e.g.
 mustard gas, lewisite, phosgene oxime, etc.), pulmonary agents (e.g.
 phosgene, chlorine), or otherwise very toxic chemicals (e.g.
 hydrogen cyanide, cyanogen chloride).
 The nerve agents and some of the blistering agents are banned by international treaty, but other toxic chemicals have legitimate uses in industry.
 Information on toxicity is obtained from running tests using animals, usually on rats or mice.
 The lethal dose required to kill 50% of the test animal (LD50 ) is expressed in units of milligrams per kilogram of body weight.
 The liquid nerve agent is placed under a patch on the animal�s skin.
 The assumption is made that the test results can be extrapolated to a 70 kg man.
 For the inhalation tests, the animals are placed in an enclosure with a certain concentration (milligrams per cubic meter) of the agent and allowed to breathe the agent for specified time (usually 1 or 4 hours, or other time).
 The lethal concentration required to kill 50% of the test animal (LC50 ).
 The dose (LCt50) has units of mg-min/m3 .
 [mg = milligrams; m3= cubic meter].
 When adjusting the data to humans, the assumption is made that the human is at rest and breathing at the rate of 20 liters/minute If a person is breathing heavily, he/she could receive a higher dose.
 Table 1 lists LD50 and LCt50 values extrapolated to a 70 kg man obtained from animal studies, as cited in Lane�s Chem-Bio Handbook:
 The inhalation dose of tabun, sarin, or soman required to produce miosis (small eye pupils) is about 2 or 3 mg-min/m3.
 The U.S.
 Department of Energy has published Temporary Emergency Exposure Limits for inhalation of Sarin or VX (table 2):
 TEEL is an acronym for Temporary Emergency Exposure Limit.
 TEEL numbers are developed by the Subcommittee on Consequence Assessment and Protective Actions (SCAPA), under the U.S.
 Department of Energy (DOE).
 They are considered temporary values to be used until peer-review numbers are established as Emergency Response Planning Guidelines (ERPG), which is another list published by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.
 Their definitions are as follows:
 TEEL-1:
 The maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed without experiencing other than mild transient adverse health effects or perceiving a clearly defined, objectionable odor.
 TEEL-2:
 The maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual�s ability to take protective action.
 TEEL-3:
 The maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed without experiencing or developing life-threatening health effects.
 The exposure time is not stated in the DOE definition but one hour is implied.
 Toxicity of Pesticides Pesticides
 We will limit the discussion to pesticides that inhibit cholinesterase.
 The two major classifications are (1) organophosphate pesticides and (2) carbamate pesticides.
 Pralidoxime chloride (2-PAMCl) may be administered along with atropine in the case of organophosphate pesticide poisoning, but pralidoxime chloride (2-PAMCl) should not be administered in the case of carbamate pesticide poisoning (it may be ineffective and possibly do more harm than good).
 Table 3 and 4 present toxicity data based on rat studies, by ingestion, skin absorption, and inhalation.
 The source of the information contained in tables 3 and 4 is the EXTOXNET website at http://ace.ace.orst.edu/info/extoxnet/pips/ghindex.html .
 The information from which tables 3 and 4 were constructed came from many researchers.
 The researchers came up with different results.
 Sometimes different animals were used instead of rats.
 Some researchers used a 4-hour inhalation test, some used one hour.
 Some used all male rats, some used female rats (female rats usually more susceptible to the chemical).
 A range of LD50 or LC50 values are presented for the different results.
 Tables 3 and 4 obviously have different units than table 1.
 The assumption is made that the rat (or other test animal) translates to a 70 kg man, and that the oral LD50 and dermal LD50 animal values in units of mg of chemical per kg of body weight can be multiplied by 70 to estimate the dose for a 70 kg man.
 For the inhalation LC50 comparison, the calculations get somewhat murky.
 The accumulated dose up to l hour in time is assumed to be linear, e.g.
 Dose = (concentration)x(time), x denotes multiplication.
 After one hour, the accumulative dose drops off and tends to be proportional to the square root of the exposure time.
 This means that to convert the 4-hour test to a 1-hour equivalent test, the 4-hour concentrations (mg/m3 ) should be multiplied by 2.
 To get units of mg-min/m3 , the 1-hour test equivalent should be multiplied by 60.
 For example, phorate is one of the most toxic organophosphate pesticides listed with a 4-hour LC50 for rats of 60 mg/m3.
 The 1-hour equivalent LC50 calculates out to be 120 mg/m3.
 This number is multiplied by 60 to get 72,000 mg-min/m3 (or 72 grams-min/m3).
 The major conclusion is that the lethal dose required to kill is several orders of magnitude higher for pesticides than for any of the nerve agents.
 The more toxic of the pesticides are classified as �Restricted Use Pesticides� in the United States, meaning, that they can only be purchased and used by certified applicators and applied according to directions.
 Other criteria such as possible contamination of groundwater and toxicity to wildlife are considered.
 In this list, Restricted Use Pesticides are (1) azinphos-methyl, (2) dichlorvos, (3) diazinon, (4) disulfoton, (5) fenamiphos, (6) fonofos, (7) isofenphos, (8) most formulations of methidathion, (9) methyl parathion, (10) mevinphos, (11) parathion, (12) phorate, (13) some formulations of propetamphos, (14) terbefos, (15) some formulations of bendiocarb, (16) carbofuran, (17) methomyl, (18) oxamyl, and (19) some formulations of propoxur.
 The very toxic aldicarb is no longer used.
 The less toxic pesticides are classified as �General Use Pesticides�, meaning, that formulations containing these pesticides can be purchased and used by the general public.
 The TEEL concentrations for pesticides are almost always several orders of magnitude greater than for nerve agents.
 However the TEEL-3 values for a few of the most toxic pesticides do indeed approach the TEEL-3 value for Sarin.
 Do People Exposed to These Chemicals Fully Recover?
 Deaths have occurred due to nerve agents and pesticide poisoning.
 There can be complications administrating the antidote atropine to patients with heart disease or are hypoxic.
 Patients exposed to these chemicals also recover and their cholinesterase levels return to normal.
 Additional details on pesticide exposure can be found at the EXTOXNET website at http://ace.ace.orst.edu/info/extoxnet/pips/ghindex.html .
 Even though cholinesterase levels recover after exposure, some patients experience neurological problems after chronic exposure to some pesticides for very long time and may never fully recover.
 The subject is a controversial one.
 Animal tests in most cases show that the organophosphate or carbamate chemical is metabolized or excreted directly and does not accumulate within the body.
 Long term animal feeding studies sometimes show liver and kidney and blood changes.
 Available information seems to indicate that most of the chemicals are not carcinogenic.
 For some of the chemicals the animal test cancer data are inconclusive or can result in cancer at relatively high doses.
 Can a Terrorist Disperse Pesticides To Get the Same Effects as Nerve Agents?
 Fortunately, the available pesticides which inhibit cholinesterase have very low vapor pressures and are much less toxic than the nerve agents.
 Also the formulations that are commercially available are not easily dispersed in large quantities into the air.
 Other toxic chemicals (e.g.
 ammonia, chlorine, etc.) may be more attractive to a terrorist.
 This is not to say that pesticides would not be used as a terrorist weapon.
 Delivery Delivery
 The four nerve agents (Tabun, Sarin, Soman, and VX) are liquids.
 Sarin is somewhat volatile and can disperse in a gaseous (vapor) form.
 VX is an oily liquid which does not readily volitilize as a vapor.
 But VX droplets stick to surfaces, and a person can be poisoned if his/her clothing or skin contacts these surfaces.
 The pesticides listed in tables 3 and 4 are mostly crystalline solids.
 Some are liquids.
 Most have a very low vapor pressure, some have higher vapor pressures.
 The product formulations for any of these pesticides may be a liquid, granules, emulsions, flowable powder, or even (for some) dispersed as an aerosol using a gas to propel the chemical into the air.
 These product formulations have been developed to maximize the effect against the target insects (or other pests) while minimizing exposure to the applicant.
 May of the solid pesticides are soluble in water, alcohol, or other solvent.
 Oily or otherwise hard-to-handle chemicals can be emulsified into some other liquid using surfactants, or clays or other materials mixed allowing dispersal as a fine powder.
 The same technologies used in the pesticide industry in developing product formulations to ease dispersal can potentially be used by a terrorist to disperse a toxic chemical into crowd.
 The terrorist wants to disperse a highly toxic material as a gas, a vapor, or as very fine aerosol or powder into the air, or by contact.
 Introduction Introduction
 Sometimes even after obtaining a federal registration, a pesticide registrant may need to meet other federal, state, or local requirements.
 The following listing is only intended to provide general information on some of these requirements and/or to provide a point of contact.
 It should be noted that the listing is not all inclusive.
 It remains the applicant�s and the registrant�s responsibility to comply with all federal, state, or local regulations.

 State Regulation of Federally Registered Pesticides Pesticides
 FIFRA section 24(a) provides that �A state may regulate the sale or use of any federally registered pesticide or device in the state, but only if and to the extent that the regulation does not permit any sale or use prohibited by this Act.� Act.�
 Even though a federal registration may have been obtained for a given pesticide product allowing the distribution and sale of the product within the United States, a state may have additional requirements that must be met before the pesticide product can be distributed or sold within that state.
 The requirements vary from state to state, and may include:
 additional data requirements, requirements,
 additional restrictions on pesticide use within its jurisdiction, and and
 licensing requirements.
 The applicant should contact each state in which the product is to be marketed to determine what additional requirements may affect the sale, distribution, or use of that product.
 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (TSCA)
 The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) New Chemicals Program, located in the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, was established to help manage the potential risk from chemicals new to the marketplace.
 It is mandated by section 5 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).
 TSCA, enacted by Congress in 1976, gives EPA broad authority to identify and control substances that may pose a threat to human health or the environment.
 Premanufacturing Notices for New Chemicals Chemicals
 The New Chemicals Program functions as a "gatekeeper" that can identify conditions up to and including a ban on production to be placed on the use of a new chemical before it is entered into commerce.
 Anyone who plans to manufacture or import a new chemical substance for a non-exempt commercial purpose is required by section 5 of TSCA to provide EPA with notice before initiating the activity.
 This premanufacturing notice, or PMN, must be submitted at least 90 days before the manufacture or import of the chemical.
 Inert Ingredients Must Be on TSCA Inventory Inventory
 All applicants for new inert ingredients need to confirm that their chemical is on the TSCA inventory (either �grandfathered in� or reviewed in the PMN program).
 If it is not, they need to go through the PMN process to get the inert on the inventory as an initial step toward its approval as an inert ingredient.
 Refer to the TSCA New Chemicals Program for further information.
 Nonindigenous and Genetically Engineered Microbial Products Including Killed Microbials Microbials
 Products of recombinant DNA technology are also regulated by EPA under TSCA by the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) during stages of production before the products become pesticides (such as during fermentation).
 A Premanufacturing Notice (PMN) may be required for these products.
 PMNs are not required while the product is under research and development (such as under an EUP), and are also not required for nonindigenous or trans conjugant organisms.

 Uses of Pesticides Regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (FDA)
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and EPA have several areas of mutual regulatory responsibility, which may require review by one or both agencies.
 The following is a brief summary of these areas and the Antimicrobial Web pages should be consulted periodically for any recent agreements between FDA and EPA on emerging technologies and issues.
 Antimicrobial Pesticides Regulated by FDA and EPA EPA
 Antimicrobial agents are subject to regulation by FDA and EPA, either singly or jointly, depending upon the use.
 The most complex area involves the use of antimicrobials in or on food.
 The descriptions provided below address both food and nonfood uses regulated by FDA; antimicrobial food uses subject to dual jurisdiction, regulated by both FDA and EPA; and antimicrobial food uses regulated by EPA.
 Antimicrobial Uses Regulated Solely by the FDA FDA
 The following are uses of antimicrobials that are regulated exclusively by FDA.
 No section 3 registration under FIFRA is required.
 Use of an antimicrobial in/on processed food.
 Application of an antimicrobial to process water in a food processing facility where the water is only a vehicle for transporting the antimicrobial chemical to the processed food.
 Use of an antimicrobial in/on living man or animal.
 Use of an antimicrobial in/on cosmetics.
 Use of an antimicrobial in/on beverages.
 Use of an antimicrobial in/on drugs.
 Use of an antimicrobial in/on animal feed.
 Antimicrobial Uses Subject to Dual Jurisdiction Jurisdiction
 The following are antimicrobial food uses that are subject to dual jurisdiction.
 FDA regulates residues that may occur on processed food through the indirect food additives process, which is described in 21 CFR Parts 175 - 178.
 These uses are also considered pesticide uses subject to registration under FIFRA.
 However, a food additive clearance must be obtained from FDA before EPA will approve the application.
 Inquiries to FDA should be directed to the address listed at the end of this section.
 Treatment of raw agricultural commodities in a food processing facility.
 Application of an antimicrobial to process water in a food processing facility to control a pest in the water (e.g., pulp and paperboard use, use in cane-sugar and beet-sugar mills).
 Production of food packaging.
 Production of food contact articles other than food packaging; no intended effect on the surface of the article.
 Antimicrobial Food Uses Regulated Solely by EPA EPA
 The following are antimicrobial food uses regulated exclusively by EPA:
 Use of an antimicrobial for pre- and/or post-harvest field use on crops.
 Use of antimicrobials by consumers on raw agricultural commodities (e.g., home gardens, home produce washes).
 Application of an antimicrobial to process water for post-harvest use (field washing) of raw agricultural commodities.
 Application of an antimicrobial to animal drinking water.
 Treatment of permanent or semi-permanent food contact surfaces (sanitizers).
 Use of an antimicrobial in the production of food contact articles, other than food packaging, where the antimicrobial is intended to have an ongoing effect on the article�s food contact surface or in food that may contact the article.

 Antimicrobial Pesticides Used on Medical Devices Devices
 An antimicrobial agent used on medical devices is considered by FDA to be an accessory to a medical device.
 Accordingly, FDA requires pre-market notification under section 510(k) of the FFDCA for marketing of such agents.
 FDA reviews the safety and efficacy of these antimicrobial products.
 Approval by both FDA and EPA must be obtained before these products may be sold or distributed.

 Human Drugs Drugs
 FDA and EPA have areas of mutual responsibility with respect to applications for drugs under FFDCA and for registration of pesticides under FIFRA.
 In 1971, FDA and EPA issued a �Memorandum of Agreement� stating which agency has primary or secondary responsibility on specific matters (Federal Register Notice, 36 FR 24234).
 This agreement was updated in 1973 (38 FR 24233), in 1979 (44 FR 63749), in 1993 referring to pediculicides (58 FR 65452), and in 1994 (PR Notice 94-6).
 Briefly, EPA has primary jurisdiction for disinfectants and sanitizers.
 FDA has primary jurisdiction for new human drugs, and products that are intended to:
 control parasites on humans, humans,
 relieve the effect of insect bites, bites,
 prevent diaper rash through treatment of diapers, diapers,
 treat athletes foot, and and
 treat drinking water to control animal parasites or diseases.
 Questions on these areas of jurisdiction may be referred to EPA's Antimicrobials Division for disinfectant and sanitizer treatments, and Registration Division, Insecticide Branch, for human or animal drug/pesticide treatments.
 Please refer to Chapter 21 of this manual.
 Animal Drugs Drugs
 The EPA and FDA are currently in discussion to determine what categories of products are regulated as pesticides and what categories of products are regulated as animal drugs.
 Applicants should contact either FDA or EPA for additional information.

 Use of Pesticides Regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT) (DOT)
 Shipping (Transportation) of Pesticides Pesticides
 The U.S.
 Department of Transportation (DOT) and EPA have several areas of mutual regulatory responsibility, which may require review by one or both agencies.
 The Hazardous Material Transportation Uniform Safety Act, as amended in 1990, requires that pesticides being shipped are properly packaged, marked, and labeled.
 If the pesticide to be shipped is considered a hazardous material, it will need to bear the proper DOT Hazard Warning Labels prominently on the product labeling.
 Also, depending upon the size of the shipment, trucks may need to be placarded.
 If you wish to transport pesticides that may present physical or chemical hazards, you must obtain shipping papers from DOT before such shipment.

 National Organics Program Program
 The National Organic Program (NOP) develops, implements, and administers national production, handling, and labeling standards for organic agricultural products.
 The NOP also accredits the certifying agents (foreign and domestic) who inspect organic production and handling operations to certify that they meet USDA standards.
 Pesticide Registration Notice 2003-1 describes how registrants can obtain EPA approval of label language indicating that all ingredients (active and inert) in a pesticide product and all uses of that pesticide meet the criteria defined in the USDA NOP Rule.
 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Requirements Requirements
 As employers, pesticide manufacturers and registrants may be subject to requirements designed to promote worker safety and health under the laws administered by OSHA.
 OSHA under 29 CFR 1910 has established health standards (such as permissible exposure limits for certain hazardous chemicals) and safety standards (such as providing personal protective equipment).
 These standards may be applicable to workplaces where pesticides are manufactured, handled or stored, if these hazards are present.
 In addition, generally the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) (29 CFR 1910.1200) requires labeling, material safety data sheets, and training for workers who may be exposed to hazardous chemicals.
 One exception is that pesticides bearing an EPA-approved FIFRA label are not subject to the OSHA label requirements, though the HCS data sheet and training requirements may still apply.
 The term 'pesticide' covers insecticides, herbicides (weed killers--eg Agent Orange), and fungicides.
 Insecticides and fungicides are needed as the plants are so weakened through constant hybridisation (GM foods is the next level), along with the use of chemical fertilisers (that also upset the soil ecology) that nature (insects and fungi) comes along to put them out of their misery asap.
 This article gives a small idea about that effect, and Bovine TB and badgers shows what happens to cows who get the same treatment.
 With Organic farming there would be little or no need for pesticides.
 The massive overuse of DDT led to outbreaks of Polio which they covered up by using the viral scam (see Virus hunters), which is till running, now they use OPV (Oral polio vaccine) to attack third world children (see) along with their Pesticide attacks if they can get away with it.
 They also covered up Phosmet poisoning with 'BSE' exposed by Mark Purdey whose veterinarian and lawyer were killed in car crashes, while he died of cancer before his time, and time will tell how much Alzheimer's is connected to pesticides, we do know one scientist, Tsunao Saitoh, looking into that was assassinated.
 Using Agent Orange with Dioxin levels1,000 times it's needed level for a herbicide was a pretty big flag as to the real nature of Monsanto and co.
 The purpose of this document is to enable health care workers and public health officials to recognize an unknown or suspected exposure to a nerve agent or an organophosphate (OP) pesticide.
 Nerve agents are chemical warfare agents that have the same mechanism of action as OP organophosphate pesticides insecticides.
 They are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase .
 Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase leads , thereby leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine in the central and peripheral nervous system.
 Excess acetylcholine produces a predictable cholinergic syndrome consisting of copious respiratory and oral secretions, diarrhea and vomiting, sweating, altered mental status, autonomic instability, and generalized weakness that can progress to paralysis and respiratory arrest.
 The amount and route of exposure to the nerve agent or OP pesticide, the type of nerve agent or pesticide, and the premorbid condition of the person exposed person will contribute to the time of onset and the severity of illness.
 For example, inhalation of a nerve agent or an OP pesticide leads to a quicker onset of poisoning with more severe symptoms when compared to with dermal exposure s, given the same amount of agent.
 Signs and symptoms symptoms
 The following is a more comprehensive list of signs and symptoms that may be encountered in a person exposed to a nerve agent or OP pesticide.
 Signs and symptoms are not listed in order of presentation or specificity.
 Also, partial presentations (an absence of some of the following signs/symptoms) do not necessarily imply less severe disease.

 �Cholinesterase activity correlates poorly with severity of local effects after vapor exposures.
 �Plasma or RBC cholinesterase may be disproportionately inhibited depending on the particular nerve agent, amount of exposure and time interval since exposure.
 Interpreting cholinesterase activity activity
 �Plasma cholinesterase cholinesterase
 ?usually declines faster than RBC cholinesterase ; ;
 ?is easier to assay than RBC cholinesterase ; ;
 ?regenerates faster than RBC cholinesterase ; ;
 ?may have a day-to-day variation in enzyme activity may be as high as 20% ; ;

 ?can show false depression from liver disease, malnutrition, pregnancy, genetic deficiency, or drugs ( e.g., codeine, morphine, cocaine, succinylcholine) .
 �Red blood cell cholinesterase cholinesterase
 ?is a better reflection of CNS cholinesterase activity ; ;
 ?is more specific test than plasma cholinesterase ; ;
 ?may have a day-to-day variation in enzyme activity may be as high as 10% ; and and
 ?can show false depression from antimalarial therapy , or pernicious anemia anemia

 Note:
 The actual clinical manifestations of an exposure to a nerve agent or an organophosphate pesticide may be more variable than the syndrome described in this document.
 This toxic syndrome description is based on CDC�s best current information.
 It may be updated as new information becomes available.
 Federal Regulatory Support:
 U.S.
 Registration Agent Agent
 For foreign companies importing into the United States, a U.S.
 registration agent is required.
 A registered agent acts as a registered address of the corporation in the U.S.
 and provides this registered address for the receipt of service of government filings � and sometimes legal documents - and acts as a liaison for government agencies.
 EPA EPA
 The EPA states, �All applicants for chemical and pesticide registrations must provide a U.S.
 address for correspondence.
 All correspondence concerning the pesticide product or any subsequent registration actions will be mailed to the address of record in the U.S.
 for foreign registrants.
 Generally a registrant not located in the United States will designate an authorized agent who resides in the United States.
 When a U.S.
 agent is designated, the agent�s U.S.
 address is considered to be the U.S.
 address of record for the foreign registrant." registrant."
 FDA FDA
 The FDA states, �Any foreign establishment engaged in the manufacture,preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing of a device imported into the United States must identify a United States agent (U.S.
 agent) for that establishment.� establishment.�
 TSG assists foreign companies by acting as a U.S.
 agent to ensure that the company is compliant with all regulations outlined by the EPA and FDA.
 Some of TSG�s U.S.
 Agent services include:
 ?Assisting a foreign company in communications with the EPA /FDA /FDA
 ?Responding to questions asked by EPA/FDA regarding a company�product company�product

 Agent Orange has been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer in Vietnam veterans.
 In a study of more than 13,000 male veterans, those who were exposed to Agent Orange were twice as likely to have prostate cancer as those who were not exposed.
 Agent Orange has been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer in Vietnam veterans.
 In a study of more than 13,000 male veterans, those who were exposed to Agent Orange were twice as likely to have prostate cancer as those who were not exposed.
 The Agent Orange-exposed veterans also fared worse in other respects:
 They were diagnosed with prostate cancer at a younger age, were twice as likely to develop an aggressive form of the cancer, and were three times more likely to have cancer that had already spread (metastasized) by the time they saw the doctor.
 Researchers considered individual factors that might affect prostate cancer risk including the known risks of African-American heritage or family history of this cancer.
 They concluded that Agent Orange exposure stood out as an independent risk factor and called for the medical community to increase screening for these men.
 This study was notable as being the largest study of Agent Orange and prostate cancer.
 The veterans, entering their 60s, were reaching the age when prostate cancer typically develops.
 The availability of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) screening greatly enhanced diagnosis and tracking of this cancer.
 The researchers examined medical records of men enrolled in the VA Northern California Health Care System who were followed between 1998 and 2006.
 Agent Orange was the most widely used herbicide in the Vietnam war, with more than 19 million pounds applied over forests and fields of Vietnam between 1962 and 1971.
 Exposure to Agent Orange has been linked to several kinds of cancer � Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, soft tissue sarcomas, and now prostate cancer.
 Agent Orange � a 50:50 mixture of the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T � was contaminated with the toxic chemical TCDD.
 Popularly known as "dioxin," TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) is now classified as a chemical that is known to cause cancer in humans.
 Who is Monsanto?
 The world's largest supplier of herbicides, bioengineered seeds, and hormones to increase milk production.
 Its primary product is Roundup and its goal is global dominance of the food supply.
 Roundup and its cousins are marketed under about 90 different names.
 In 1997, Monsanto lost a lawsuit and agreed to stop using the terms "bio-degradable" and "environmentally friendly" in its advertising.
 Why?
 Because these products would appear to be direct descendents of Agent Orange, the company's most infamous product.
 The company has stated that Roundup is safer than table salt but independent analyses show that the product contains 41% glyphosate and the rest is water and any of 2300 other chemicals that are "trade secrets." secrets."
 The primary byproduct of herbicide manufacture is dioxin, a chemical described by some as the most toxic on the Planet.
 It has been implicated in any number of issues from Agent Orange to the Love Canal.
 A study at Lund University in Sweden suggests that herbicides seriously lower immunity in such a way as to allow viruses such as Epstein-Barr to proliferate.
 They are also implicated in the epidemic increase of non-Hodgkins lymphomas.
 Why boycott Roundup and other herbicides?
 About half of Monsanto's income is derived from herbicide sales.
 Boycotting this product would vastly inhibit the company's ability to poison the Earth.
 Roundup Resistant Seeds are genetically modified seeds that are specially designed to be tolerant to Roundup.
 Many of them are based on "terminator seed" technology that causes seeds to be sterile, thereby obliging farmers to purchase seeds each year from Monsanto subsidiary Delta and Pine Land Co.
 These terminator seeds encroach on surrounding crops, spreading at the rate of about seven miles per year.
 Native species of corn that have been pollinated by genetically modified crops have been found in remote areas of Mexico.
 The main crops grown with these seeds are canola, soybeans, corn, sugar beets, and cotton.
 The company's goal is to have 620 million acres planted with its seeds! seeds!
 Bovine Growth Hormone is a genetically modified substance that is injected into cows to cause them to produce more milk.
 Beef derived from cows treated with this hormone has been banned in the European Union and Canada.
 The hormone has been linked to increased incidence of breast and prostate cancer.
 It is sold under the name Posilac.
 According to Dr.
 Samuel Epstein, rBGH causes cows to become sick.
 Among the 20 or more different illnesses caused by this genetically engineered hormone is mastitis.
 Milk from rGBH-treated cows is often contaminated by both the pus from the mastitis and antibiotics used to treat the mastitis.
 Higher levels of growth hormone in the milk create a nutritional hazard.
 Moreover, the milk itself tends to go bad faster because of its impurities.
 Horizon and many other dairies assure consumers that their products do not use milk from cows injected with rBGH.
 My awareness of some of the exploits of Monsanto goes back to the mid-60s when I worked on Wall Street.
 My boss was the chemical analyst and a great enthusiast for Monsanto but when I had to cover for him, I spent long hours in the company library reading files on law suits against pharmaceutical and drug companies.
 I developed a healthy distrust for their ad campaigns and later for their influence on Government.
 Monsanto has a simply enormous influence on Government, and where the new technologies are concerned, it is a case of putting the fox in charge of the chickens because others do not have the means to substantiate the claims made by companies dealing with cutting edge technologies.
 No matter how you slice it, Monsanto is probably the biggest cause of deterioration of both health and the environment.
 Moreover, because of its collusion with Government, its products, such as Aspartame, have curious ways of reappearing after being banned (for causing seizures and brain tumors.) This company produces more PCBs, defoliants, herbicides, and dangerous chemicals and drugs than anyone else on the Planet.
 It's time to speak by boycotting their products.
 Since 2002, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) and the Virginia Pesticide Control Board have recognized Virginia Cooperative Extension agents and specialists for their outstanding participation in the pesticide container recycling program, the pesticide disposal program and pesticide safety education courses.
 In 2010, the following agents were recognized for their outstanding performance:
 �Pesticide Container Recycling Program � The Plastic Pesticide Container Recycling award was given to Kelvin Wells, Extension Agent in Sussex County, for contributing approximately 7,360 pounds of the statewide total of nearly 47,000 pounds of properly rinsed plastic pesticide containers and for possessing the many attributes that ensure a successful program.
 These attributes include flexibility, maintaining open communication with the project partners, ability to formulate and complete a thorough administrative plan and exhibiting a high degree of professionalism throughout the process.
 �Pesticide Disposal Program � For their combined efforts, the award for the Pesticide Disposal Program went to Extension Agents Watson Lawrence, Chesapeake; Cyndi Wyskiewicz, Portsmouth; and Cal Schieman, Virginia Beach.
 This year�s winning trio excelled at both cooperation and collaboration, including local coordination and site selection; notifying agricultural producers and homeowners of the availability of the pesticide disposal program, including location and the date of collection; and educating agricultural producers and homeowners on proper storage and disposal of unwanted pesticides.
 This trio ensured representation during the event and exemplified the type of cooperation needed for program success.
 These three Tidewater agents collected 18,430 pounds out of a total statewide effort of 95,506 pounds of unwanted or unused pesticides collected.
 �Pesticide Safety Education Education
 First Place Place
 Procrastinator�s Commercial Pesticide Applicators Recertification Training and Last Call Commercial Pesticide Applicators Recertification Training:
 Debbie Dillion, Loudoun; Paige Thacker, Prince William; Adria Bordas, Fairfax; Tim Ohlwiler, Fauquier; Kirsten Buhls, Arlington; Adam Downing, Madison; Sue Naille and Leslie Blischak, Loudoun; Extension Specialist Lloyd Hipkins, Virginia Tech; and Frank Filipy and Tom Burke, VDACS.
 The first place award recognizes a team of agents who provided two critical recertification opportunities to green industry applicators when opportunities were scarce and demand was high as the commercial certification year was closing.
 The agents found a free location with space enough to seat more than 100 participants as well as room to incorporate a round robin series of active, hands-on stations to cover Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), pesticide storage, spill clean-up and laundering pesticide contaminated clothing.
 New topics covered included �When Green Ain�t Good � Common Invasive Plants� and the new and exotic insect pests appearing in Virginia.
 A total of 153 commercial applicators participated in these classes.
 As a result of the programs, 98 percent of the participants wrote that they now knew how to comply with state and federal laws and regulations, read labels and used the required PPE.
 Second Place Place
 Registered Technician Pesticide Certification and Registered Technician and Commercial Applicator Pesticide Recertification, June 16-18, 2009 and March 19, 2010; Taylor Clarke, Mecklenburg; Cynthia Gregg, Brunswick; Bruce Jones, Appomattox; Bob Jones, Charlotte; David Smith, Cumberland; Grace Hite, Halifax; Eric Bowen, Goochland/Powhatan; Mike Parrish, Dinwiddie; former agents Katie Baker, Lunenburg and Brent Clayton, Prince Edward; Dr.
 Charles Johnson and Dr.
 Paul Semtner, Southern Piedmont Agriculture and Research Educational Center (AREC), and Vickie Rengers and Mike Elliott, VDACS.
 The second place award in the Pesticide Safety Education category goes to a group of agents who recognized the need for a formal training program for prospective Registered Technicians in their area, as well as ongoing recertification support for these applicators once they had passed their exams.
 The instructors used a variety of teaching methods for the Registered Technician certification training, including PowerPoint presentations, hands-on instruction and demonstrations.
 Since the three days of training was hosted at their area AREC, students were given the opportunity to work hands-on with equipment and calibrate sprayers, assemble and use a spill kit and work with Personal Protective Equipment.
 A testing session was scheduled three weeks after the training.
 Pre- and post-training evaluations showed a significant increase in pesticide safety knowledge, and 83 percent of those taking the Registered Technician exam passed.
 The recertification class, offered nine months after the initial training and testing, offered attendees the opportunity to recertify in Ag Pest Plant, Turf, and Right of Way categories and reinforced the lessons taught previously on pesticide safety.
 The two courses had a total of 27 participants, including employees of municipalities, schools and agribusinesses.
 The pesticide storage information provided in the training was credited with improving the pesticide storage unit being planned for a new county maintenance building.
 Participants all rated the recertification class as very good to excellent and affirmed that they understood how to comply with pesticide laws and regulations, read pesticide labels and wear the appropriate PPE.
 Third Place Place
 Development and Adoption of IPM Elements for Christmas Tree Growers Growers
 For their work in the development and adoption of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Elements for Christmas Tree Growers, Wythe Morris, Carroll County; Kevin Spurlin, Grayson County and Bryan Davis, North Carolina Extension received the third place award for Pesticide Safety Education.
 This group�s work began in response to a controversy involving pesticide use on Christmas trees in Grayson County.
 Growers asked for a tool to improve public relations.
 Virginia Tech Pesticide Programs, through the support of the Southern IPM Center, developed a set of IPM Elements for Christmas tree growers.
 These agents incorporated the elements into their pesticide and pest management training over the past several years.
 They met with Mount Rogers area growers on a continuous basis through one-on-one farm visits, association meetings and pesticide applicator recertification workshops.
 In each, the elements were used as the keystone of their training.
 The impact of this effort has been the adoption of this tool by the industry as standard operating practices in integrated pest management.
 This program serves as a model for others to adopt the IPM Elements tool into other crops across Virginia.
 Growers who have adopted the elements are reducing pesticide use and establishing a branded crop in the area based on sound and environmentally-friendly IPM practices.
 The elements are being adopted to operate a new state-run Frasier fir seedling nursery being located in the area.

 Agent Orange is the code name for one of the herbicides and defoliants used by the U.S.
 military as part of its herbicidal warfare program, Operation Ranch Hand, during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1971.
 Vietnam estimates 400,000 people were killed or maimed, and 500,000 children born with birth defects. defects.
 A 50:50 mixture of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D, it was manufactured for the U.S.
 Department of Defense primarily by Monsanto Corporation and Dow Chemical.
 The 2,4,5-T used to produce Agent Orange was later discovered to be contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, an extremely toxic dioxin compound.
 It was given its name from the color of the orange-striped 55 US gallon (208 L) barrels in which it was shipped, and was by far the most widely used of the so-called "Rainbow Herbicides".[2] Herbicides".[2]
 During the Vietnam War, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed nearly 20,000,000 US gallons (75,700,000 L) of chemical herbicides and defoliants in Vietnam, eastern Laos and parts of Cambodia, as part of Operation Ranch Hand.[3][4] The program's goal was to defoliate forested and rural land, depriving guerrillas of cover; another goal was to induce forced draft urbanization, destroying the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside, and forcing them to flee to the U.S.
 dominated cities, thus depriving the guerrillas of their rural support base and food supply.[4][5] supply.[4][5]
 The US began to target food crops in October 1962, primarily using Agent Blue.
 In 1965, 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops.[5] Rural-to-urban migration rates dramatically increased in South Vietnam, as peasants escaped the destruction and famine in the countryside by fleeing to the U.S.-dominated cities.
 The urban population in South Vietnam nearly tripled:
 from 2.8 million people in 1958, to 8 million by 1971.
 The rapid flow of people led to a fast-paced and uncontrolled urbanization; an estimated 1.5 million people were living in Saigon slums, while many South Vietnamese elites and U.S.
 personnel lived in luxury.[6] luxury.[6]
 United States Air Force records show that at least 6,542 spraying missions took place over the course of Operation Ranch Hand.[7] By 1971, 12 percent of the total area of South Vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals, at an average concentration of 13 times the recommended USDA application rate for domestic use.[8] In South Vietnam alone, an estimated 10 million hectares of agricultural land were ultimately destroyed.[9] In some areas TCDD concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered "safe" by the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency.[10][11] Overall, more than 20% of South Vietnam's forests were sprayed at least once over a nine year period.[5] period.[5]

 Iso-octyl 2,4-D and iso-octyl 2,4,5-T 2,4,5-T
 2,4-D 2,4-D
 2,4,5-TChemically, Agent Orange is an approximately 1:1 mixture of two phenoxyl herbicides � 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) � in iso-octyl ester form.[12] form.[12]
 Numerous studies have examined health effects linked to Agent Orange, its component compounds, and its manufacturing byproducts.[13] byproducts.[13]
 Prior to the controversy surrounding Agent Orange, there was already a large body of scientific evidence linking 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D to serious negative health effects and ecological damage.[14] But in 1969, it was revealed to the public that the 2,4,5-T was contaminated with a dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), and that the TCDD was causing many of the previously unexplained adverse health effects which were correlated with Agent Orange exposure.[15] TCDD has been described as "perhaps the most toxic molecule ever synthesized by man".[16] Internal memoranda revealed Monsanto Corporation (a manufacturer of 2,4,5-T) had informed the U.S.
 government as early as 1952 that 2,4,5-T was contaminated with a toxic contaminant.[17] In the manufacture of 2,4,5-T, accidental overheating of the reaction mixture easily causes the product to condense into the toxic self-condensation product TCDD.
 At the time, precautions were not taken against this unintended side reaction, which caused also the Seveso disaster in Italy in 1976.
 In addition to this, 2,4,5-T is hazardous in its own right.
 In 1979, the Yale biologist Arthur Galston, who specialized in herbicide research, published a review of what was known at the time about the toxicity of TCDD.
 Even "vanishingly small" quantities of dioxin in the diet caused adverse health effects when tested on animals.[16] Since then, TCDD has been comprehensively studied.
 It has been associated with increased neoplasms in every animal bioassay reported in the scientific literature.[18] The National Toxicology Program has classified TCDD as "known to be a human carcinogen", frequently associated with soft-tissue sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).[19][20] (CLL).[19][20]
 While the two herbicides that make up Agent Orange, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, remain toxic over a short period�a scale of days or weeks�they quickly degrade.
 A 1969 report authored by K.
 Diane Courtney and others found 2,4,5-T could cause birth defects and stillbirths in mice.[21] Several studies have shown an increased rate of cancer mortality for workers exposed to 2,4,5-T.
 In one such study, from Hamburg, Germany, the risk of cancer mortality increased by 170% after working for 10 years at the 2,4,5-T-producing section of a Hamburg manufacturing plant.[18] Three studies have suggested prior exposure to Agent Orange poses an increased risk of acute myelogenous leukemia in the children of Vietnam veterans.[13] veterans.[13]
 Starting in 1991, the US Congress asked the Institute of Medicine to review the scientific literature on Agent Orange and the other herbicides used in Vietnam, including their active ingredients and the dioxin contaminant.
 The IOM found an association between dioxin exposure and diabetes.[22][23] diabetes.[22][23]
  Early developmentIn 1943 plant biologist Arthur Galston began studying the compound triiodobenzoic acid as a plant growth hormone, in an attempt to adapt soybeans to a short growing season.
 Galston found that excessive usage of the compound caused catastrophic defoliation � a finding later used by his colleague Ian Sussex to develop the family of herbicides used in Operation Ranch Hand.[24] Galston was especially concerned about the compound's side effects to humans and the environment.[25] environment.[25]
 In 1943, the U.S.
 Department of the Army contracted the University of Chicago to study the effects of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops.
 From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply.
 In early 1945, the U.S.
 army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the Bushnell Army Airfield in Florida, which is now listed as a Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS).[26][27] (FUDS).[26][27]
  Use in the Vietnam War War
 Map showing locations of U.S.
 army aerial herbicide spray missions in South Vietnam taking place from 1965 to 1971During the Vietnam War, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed nearly 20,000,000 US gallons (75,700,000 L) of chemical herbicides and defoliants in Vietnam, eastern Laos and parts of Cambodia, as part of the aerial defoliation program known as Operation Ranch Hand.[3][4] The goal was to defoliate rural/forested land, depriving guerrillas of food and cover and clearing in sensitive areas such as around base perimeters.[28] The program was also a part of a general policy of forced draft urbanization, which aimed to destroy the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside, forcing them to flee to the U.S.
 dominated cities, depriving the guerrillas of their rural support base.[4][5] base.[4][5]
 Military film footage of U.S.
 troops spraying Agent Orange from a riverboat in VietnamSpraying was usually done either from helicopters or from low-flying C-123 Provider aircraft, fitted with sprayers and "MC-1 Hourglass" pump systems and 1,000 US gal (3,800 L) chemical tanks.
 Spray runs were also conducted from trucks, boats, and backpack sprayers.[29][30][31] sprayers.[29][30][31]
 The first batch of herbicides was unloaded at Tan Son Nhut Air base in South Vietnam, on January 9, 1962.[2] Air Force records show at least 6,542 spraying missions took place over the course of Operation Ranch Hand.[7] By 1971, 12 percent of the total area of South Vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals, at an average concentration of 13 times the recommended USDA application rate for domestic use.[8] In South Vietnam alone, an estimated 10 million hectares of agricultural land were ultimately destroyed.[9] In some areas, TCDD concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency.[10][11] Agency.[10][11]
 The campaign destroyed 5 million acres (20,000 km2) of upland and mangrove forests and millions of acres of crops.
 Overall, more than 20% of South Vietnam's forests were sprayed at least once over a nine year period.[5][32] period.[5][32]
 In 1965, members of the U.S.
 Congress were told "crop destruction is understood to be the more important purpose ...
 but the emphasis is usually given to the jungle defoliation in public mention of the program."[32] Soldiers were told they were destroying crops because they were going to be used to feed guerrillas.
 They later discovered nearly all of the food they had been destroying was not being produced for guerrillas; it was, in reality, only being grown to support the local civilian population.
 For example, in Quang Ngai province, 85% of the crop lands were scheduled to be destroyed in 1970 alone.
 Widespread famine occurred as a result, leaving hundreds of thousands of people malnourished or starving.[33] starving.[33]
 The U.S.
 military began targeting food crops in October 1962, primarily using Agent Blue; the American public was not made aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 (and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring).
 In 1965, 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops.
 The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the State Department in March 1966.[5][27] 1966.[5][27]
 Many experts at the time, including Arthur Galston, the biologist who developed and intensively studied TCDD, opposed herbicidal warfare, due to concerns about the side effects to humans and the environment by indiscriminately spraying the chemical over a wide area.
 As early as 1966, resolutions were introduced to the United Nations charging that the U.S.
 was violating the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which regulated the use of chemical and biological weapons.[25][34] weapons.[25][34]

 Major T?
 �?c Phang was exposed to dioxin-contaminated Agent OrangeThe Vietnam Red Cross reported as many as 3 million Vietnamese people have been affected by Agent Orange, including at least 150,000 children born with birth defects.[35] According to Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 4.8 million Vietnamese people were exposed to Agent Orange, resulting in 400,000 people being killed or maimed, and 500,000 children born with birth defects. defects.
 Children in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and extra fingers and toes.[36] In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found in the breast milk of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S.
 soldiers who had served in Vietnam.[37] The most affected zones are the mountainous area along Truong Son (Long Mountains) and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia.
 The affected residents are living in substandard conditions with many genetic diseases.[38] diseases.[38]
 Vietnamese babies, deformed and stillborn after prenatal dioxin exposure from Agent OrangeAbout 28 of the former US military bases in Vietnam where the herbicides were stored and loaded onto airplanes may still have high level of dioxins in the soil, posing a health threat to the surrounding communities.
 Extensive testing for dioxin contamination has been conducted at the former US airbases in Da Nang, Phu Cat and Bien Hoa.
 Some of the soil and sediment on the bases have extremely high levels of dioxin requiring remediation.
 The Da Nang Airbase has dioxin contamination up to 350 times higher than international recommendations for action.[39][40] The contaminated soil and sediment continue to affect the citizens of Vietnam, poisoning their food chain and causing illnesses, serious skin diseases and a variety of cancers in the lungs, larynx, and prostate.[36] prostate.[36]
  Ecological effectsAbout 17.8% (3,100,000 ha) of the total forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which dramatically disrupted ecological equilibrium.
 Furthermore, the persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of protective tree cover, and loss of seeding forest stock, meant reforestation was difficult or impossible in many areas.[41] Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species, such as bamboo and cogon grass, which make it unlikely the forests will be able to regenerate.
 Animal species diversity was also significantly impacted:
 in one study, a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and 5 species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.[42] mammals.[42]
 Dioxins from Agent Orange have persisted in the Vietnamese environment since the war, settling in the soil and sediment and entering into food chain through the animals and fish that feed in the contaminated areas.
 Movement of dioxins through the food web has resulted in bioconcentration and biomagnification.[43] The areas most heavily contaminated with dioxins are the sites of former U.S.
 air bases.[44] bases.[44]
  Sociopolitical effectsThe RAND Corporation's Memorandum 5446-ISA/ARPA states:
 "the fact that the VC obtain most of their food from the neutral rural population dictates the destruction of civilian crops ...
 if they (the VC) are to be hampered by the crop destruction program, it will be necessary to destroy large portions of the rural economy � probably 50% or more".[45] more".[45]
 Rural-to-urban migration rates dramatically increased in South Vietnam, as peasants escaped the destruction in the countryside by fleeing to the U.S.-dominated cities.
 The urban population in South Vietnam more than tripled:
 from 2.8 million people in 1958, to 8 million by 1971.
 The rapid flow of people led to a fast-paced and uncontrolled urbanization; an estimated 1.5 million people were living in Saigon slums, while many South Vietnamese elites and U.S.
 personnel lived in luxury.[6] luxury.[6]
  Effects on U.S.
 veteransStudies showed that veterans who served in the South during the war have increased rates of cancer, and nerve, digestive, skin and respiratory disorders.
 Veterans from the south had higher rates of throat cancer, acute/chronic leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, soft tissue sarcoma and liver cancer.
 Other than liver cancer, these are the same conditions the US Veteran's Administration has found to be associated with exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, and are on the list of conditions eligible for compensation and treatment.[35] treatment.[35]
 Military personnel who loaded airplanes and helicopters used in Ranch Hand probably sustained some of the heaviest exposures.
 Members of the Army Chemical Corps, who stored and mixed herbicides and defoliated the perimeters of military bases, are also thought to have had some of the heaviest exposures.
 Others with potentially heavy exposures included members of U.S.
 Army Special Forces units who defoliated remote campsites, and members of U.S.
 Navy river units who cleared base perimeters.[46] Military members who served on Okinawa also claim to have been exposed to the chemical.[47] chemical.[47]
 While in Vietnam, the veterans were told not to worry, and were persuaded the chemical was harmless.[48] After returning home, Vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects might be related to Agent Orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they were exposed in Vietnam.
 Veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange, or more specifically, dioxin, but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their discharge.
 By April 1993, the Department of Veterans Affairs had only compensated 486 victims, although it had received disability claims from 39,419 soldiers who had been exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam.[49] Vietnam.[49]
  Legal and diplomatic proceedings US veterans class action lawsuit against manufacturersSince at least 1978, several lawsuits have been filed against the companies which produced Agent Orange, among them Dow Chemical, Monsanto, and Diamond Shamrock.
 Hy Mayerson of the law firm The Mayerson Law Offices, P.C.
 was an early pioneer in Agent Orange litigation, working with renowned environmental attorney Victor Yannacone in 1980 on the first class-action suits against wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange.
 In meeting Dr.
 Ronald A.
 Codario, one of the first civilian doctors to see afflicted patients, Mayerson, so impressed by the fact an M.D.
 would show so much interest in a Vietnam veteran, forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on Agent Orange and the effects of dioxin on animals and humans to Codario's office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor.[50] The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the U.S.
 government.[51] government.[51]
 The Mayerson Law Offices, P.C., with Sgt.
 Charles E.
 Hartz as their principal client, filed the first Agent Orange class action lawsuit, in Pennsylvania in 1980, for the injuries soldiers in Vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the Agent Orange defoliant.[52] Attorney Hy Mayerson co-wrote the brief that certified the Agent Orange Product Liability action as a class action, the largest ever filed as of its filing.[53] Hartz's deposition was one of the first ever taken in America, and the first for an Agent Orange trial, for the purpose of preserving testimony at trial, as it was understood that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of the brain tumor that began to develop while he was a member of Tiger Force, Special Forces, and LRRPs in Vietnam.[54][55] The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans� lead expert, Dr.
 Ronald A.
 Codario, M.D., including about 100 hundred articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans, and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.[50] reaction.[50]
 In 1984, the class-action suit was settled out of court for $180 million; slightly over 45% of this was ordered to be paid by Monsanto alone.[56][57] Many veterans who were victims of Agent Orange exposure were outraged the case had been settled instead of going to court, and felt they had been betrayed by the lawyers.
 "Fairness Hearings" were held in five major American cities, where veterans and their families discussed their reactions to the settlement, and condemned the actions of the lawyers and courts, demanding the case be heard before a jury of their peers.
 Federal Judge Julius Weinstein refused the appeals, claiming the settlement was "fair and just".
 By 1989, the veterans' fears were confirmed when it was decided how the money from the settlement would be paid out.
 A totally disabled Vietnam veteran would receive a maximum of $12,000 spread out over the course of 10 years.
 Furthermore, by accepting the settlement payments, disabled veterans would become ineligible for many state benefits that provided far more monetary support than the settlement, such as food stamps, public assistance, and government pensions.
 A widow of a Vietnam veteran who died of Agent Orange exposure would only receive $3700.[58] $3700.[58]
 In 2004, Jill Montgomery, a spokesperson for Monsanto, said Monsanto should not be liable at all for injuries or deaths caused by Agent Orange, saying:
 "We are sympathetic with people who believe they have been injured and understand their concern to find the cause, but reliable scientific evidence indicates that Agent Orange is not the cause of serious long-term health effects."[59] effects."[59]
  New Jersey Agent Orange CommissionIn 1980, New Jersey created the New Jersey Agent Orange Commission, the first state commission created to study its effects.
 The commission's research project in association with Rutgers University was called "The Pointman Project".
 It was disbanded by Governor Christine Todd Whitman in 1996.[60] 1996.[60]
 During Pointman I, commission researchers devised ways to determine small dioxin levels in blood.
 Prior to this, such levels could only be found in the adipose (fat) tissue.
 The project compared dioxin levels in a small group of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange with a group of matched veterans who had not served in Vietnam.
 The results of this project were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1988.[61] 1988.[61]
 The second phase of the project continued to examine and compare dioxin levels in various groups of Vietnam veterans, including Army, Marines and brown water riverboat Navy personnel.
  US CongressIn 1991, the US Congress enacted the Agent Orange Act, giving the Department of Veterans Affairs the authority to declare certain conditions 'presumptive' to exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, making these veterans who served in Vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditions.[62] The same law required the National Academy of Sciences to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in Vietnam to inform the Secretary of Veterans Affairs about the strength of the scientific evidence showing association between exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin and certain conditions.[63] conditions.[63]
 Through this process, the list of 'presumptive' conditions has grown since 1991, and currently the U.S.
 Department of Veterans Affairs has listed prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, type II diabetes, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, peripheral neuropathy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide.
 This list now includes B cell leukemias, such as hairy cell leukemia, Parkinson's disease and ischemic heart disease, these last three having been added on August 31, 2010.
 Several highly placed individuals in government are voicing concerns about whether some of the diseases on the list should, in fact, actually have been included.[64] included.[64]
  U.S./Vietnamese government negotiationsIn 2002, Vietnam and the US held a joint conference on Human Health and Environmental Impacts of Agent Orange.
 Following the conference, the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) began scientific exchanges between the US and Vietnam, and began discussions for a joint research project on the human health impacts of Agent Orange.[65] Orange.[65]
 These negotiations broke down in 2005, when neither side could agree on the research protocol and the research project was cancelled.
 More progress has been made on the environmental front.
 In 2005, the first US-Vietnam workshop on remediation of dioxin was held.[65] held.[65]
 Starting in 2005, the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency?
 (EPA) began to work with the Vietnamese government to measure the level of dioxin at the Da Nang Airbase.
 Also in 2005, the Joint Advisory Committee on Agent Orange, made up of representatives of Vietnamese and US government agencies, was established.
 The committee has been meeting yearly to explore areas of scientific cooperation, technical assistance and environmental remediation of dioxin.[66] dioxin.[66]
 A breakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on this issue occurred as a result of United States President George W.
 Bush's state visit to Vietnam in November 2006.
 In the joint statement, President Bush and President Triet agreed "further joint efforts to address the environmental contamination near former dioxin storage sites would make a valuable contribution to the continued development of their bilateral relationship."[67][unreliable source?] source?]
 In late May 2007, President Bush signed into law a supplemental spending bill for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan that included an earmark of $3 million specifically for funding for programs for the remediation of dioxin 'hotspots' on former US military bases, and for public health programs for the surrounding communities;[68] some authors consider this to be completely inadequate, pointing out that the U.S.
 airbase in Da Nang, alone, will cost $14 million to clean up, and that three others are estimated to require $60 million for cleanup.[11] The appropriation was renewed in the fiscal year 2009 and again in FY 2010.
 An additional $12 million was appropriated in the fiscal year 2010 in the Supplemental Appropriations Act and a total of $18.5 million appropriated for fiscal year 2011.[69] 2011.[69]
 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated during a visit to Hanoi in October 2010 that the US government would begin work on the clean-up of dioxin contamination at the Da Nang airbase.[70] airbase.[70]
 In June 2011 a ceremony was held at Da Nang airport to mark the start of US-funded decontamination of dioxin hotspots in Vietnam.
 $32m has so far been allocated by the US congress to fund the program.[71] program.[71]
  Vietnamese victims class action lawsuit in U.S.
 courtsOn January 31, 2004, a victim's rights group, the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/dioxin (VAVA), filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, against several U.S.
 companies for liability in causing personal injury, by developing and producing the chemical.
 Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the U.S.
 military, and were named in the suit, along with the dozens of other companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.).
 On March 10, 2005, Judge Jack B.
 Weinstein of the Eastern District � who had presided over the 1984 US veterans class action lawsuit � dismissed the lawsuit, ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs' claims.
 He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under international law at the time of its use by the U.S.; the U.S.
 was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government.
 The U.S.
 government was not a party in the lawsuit, due to sovereign immunity, and the court ruled the chemical companies, as contractors of the US government, shared the same immunity.
 The case was appealed and heard by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on June 18, 2007.
 The Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal of the case, stating the herbicides used during the war were not intended to be used to poison humans and therefore did not violate international law.[72] The US Supreme Court declined to consider the case.
 Three judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan heard the appeal on June 18, 2007.
 They upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case.
 They ruled that, though the herbicides contained a dioxin (a known poison), they were not intended to be used as a poison on humans.
 Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law.
 A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision.
 The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the US Supreme Court to hear the case.
 On March 2, 2009, the Supreme Court denied certiorari and refused to reconsider the ruling of the Court of Appeals.[73] Appeals.[73]
 In a November 2004 Zogby International poll of 987 people, 79% of respondents thought the US chemical companies which produced Agent Orange defoliant should compensate US soldiers who were affected by the toxic chemical used during the war in Vietnam.
 51% said they supported compensation for Vietnamese Agent Orange victims.[74] victims.[74]
  Help for those affected in VietnamTo assist those who have been affected by Agent Orange/dioxin, the Vietnamese have established "peace villages", which each host between 50 and 100 victims, giving them medical and psychological help.
 As of 2006, there were 11 such villages, thus granting some social protection to fewer than a thousand victims.
 U.S.
 veterans of the war in Vietnam and individuals who are aware and sympathetic to the impacts of Agent Orange have supported these programs in Vietnam.
 An international group of veterans from the U.S.
 and its allies during the Vietnam War working with their former enemy � veterans from the Vietnam Veterans Association � established the Vietnam Friendship Village[75] outside of Hanoi.
 The center provides medical care, rehabilitation and vocational training for children and veterans from Vietnam who have been affected by Agent Orange.
 In 1998, The Vietnam Red Cross established the Vietnam Agent Orange Victims Fund to provide direct assistance to families throughout Vietnam that have been affected.
 In 2003, the Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange (VAVA) was formed.
 In addition to filing the lawsuit against the chemical companies, VAVA provides medical care, rehabilitation services and financial assistance to those injured by Agent Orange.[76] Orange.[76]
 The Vietnamese government provides small monthly stipends to more than 200,000 Vietnamese believed affected by the herbicides; this totaled $40.8 million in 2008 alone.
 The Vietnam Red Cross has raised more than $22 million to assist the ill or disabled, and several U.S.

 On June 16, 2010, members of the U.S.-Vietnam Dialogue Group on Agent Orange/Dioxin unveiled a comprehensive 10-year Declaration and Plan of Action to address the toxic legacy of Agent Orange and other herbicides in Vietnam.
 The Plan of Action was released as an Aspen Institute publication and calls upon the U.S.
 and Vietnamese governments to join with other governments, foundations, businesses, and nonprofits in a partnership to clean up dioxin "hot spots" in Vietnam and to expand humanitarian services for people with disabilities there.[79][80][81] On September 16, 2010, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) acknowledged the work of the Dialogue Group by releasing a statement on the floor of the United States Senate.
 The statement urges the U.S.
 government to take the Plan of Action's recommendations into account in developing a multi-year plan of activities to address the Agent Orange/dioxin legacy.[82] legacy.[82]
  Use outside VietnamWhile 'Agent Orange' was only used between 1965 and 1970, 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T and other herbicides were used by the US military from the late 1940s through the 1970s.[83][84] 1970s.[83][84]
  United StatesIn 1978, the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency suspended spraying of Agent Orange in National Forests, due to a threefold increase in miscarriages in women living near forests that had been sprayed.[85][86] sprayed.[85][86]
 A December 2006 Department of Defense report listed Agent Orange testing, storage, and disposal sites at 32 locations throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, Thailand, Puerto Rico, Korea, and in the Pacific Ocean.[87] The Veteran Administration has also acknowledged that Agent Orange was used domestically by U.S.
 forces in test sites throughout the US.
 Eglin Air Force Base in Florida was one of the primary testing sites throughout the 1960s.[88] 1960s.[88]
  KoreaAgent Orange was used in Korea in the late 1960s.[89] Republic of Korea troops were the only personnel involved in the spraying, which occurred along the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).
 "Citing declassified U.S.
 Department of Defense documents, Korean officials fear thousands of its soldiers may have come into contact with the deadly defoliant in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
 According to one top government official, as many as '30,000 Korean veterans are suffering from illness related to their exposure'.
 The exact number of GIs who may have been exposed is unknown.
 But C.
 David Benbow, a North Carolina attorney who served as a sergeant with Co.
 C, 3rd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, along the DMZ in 1968�69, estimates as many as '4,000 soldiers at any given time' could have been affected.".[90][unreliable source?] source?]
 In 1999, about 20,000 South Koreans filed two separated lawsuits against U.S.
 companies, seeking more than $5 billion in damages.
 After losing a decision in 2002, they filed an appeal. needed]
 In January 2006, the South Korean Appeals Court ordered Dow Chemical and Monsanto to pay $62 million in compensation to about 6,800 people.
 The ruling acknowledged that "the defendants failed to ensure safety as the defoliants manufactured by the defendants had higher levels of dioxins than standard", and, quoting the U.S.
 National Academy of Science report, declared that there was a "causal relationship" between Agent Orange and 11 diseases, including cancers of the lung, larynx and prostate.
 The judges failed to acknowledge "the relationship between the chemical and peripheral neuropathy, the disease most widespread among Agent Orange victims" according to the Mercury News. needed]
 The United States local press KPHO-TV in Phoenix, Arizona alleged that the United States Army has buried Agent Orange in Camp Carroll, the U.S.
 Army base located in Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea.[91] It is based on the claim of three U.S.
 Army veterans.
 They claimed approximately 250 55 gallon drums of Agent Orange were buried at Camp Carroll in 1978, which was indicated as 'Chemicals type Agent Orange' or 'Province of Vietnam, Compound Orange' with stripe around the barrel dated 1967 for the Republic of Vietnam.
 The South Korean Ministry of Environment announced that they will request cooperative investigation at Camp Carroll officially.[92] The USFK issued a statement that confirmed that barrels were buried there, but all (plus an additional 60 tons of soil) were removed in 1996.[93] 1996.[93]
 Currently, Veterans who spent even a single day, or even a few hours, in Vietnam, [as must be established by their military records], and can medically establish that anytime after this 'presumptive exposure' they developed nerve damage, diabetes, or a long list of other medical conditions will receive an 'automatic' VA settlement with a substantial amount of money each month.
 However, the V.A.
 fights every similar claim by a Korean Vet. They require added tests:
 first, that they not only establish they were assigned to S.Korea, [usually this can fairly easily be done, but, not always], for 'some significant time' in the period of clandestine use, 1968-69-70; second, that they were regularly stationed on, or near, the DMZ [This can be almost impossible to prove, as many of the official records only reflect a 'unit' assignment.
 These orders were often vague, or incomplete, and reflected only a unit assignment of a military organization that might be spread out all over the Korean peninsula.
 Many have been lost, misplaced, destroyed, or accidentally destroyed in a warehouse fire that destroyed a many old Army records.
 Most the units where either disbanded, moved, or renamed after the Vietnam Era ended, thus adding to the confusion.]; and lastly, a written opinion by doctor of diagnosis [all that is required of Vietnam Vets], but stating further that disease, or condition, arrises from Agent Orange, and not the other toxic herbasides/chemicals that all Vets are rutinely exposed to. needed]
  Canadian Forces Base Gagetown (New Brunswick, Canada)The U.S.
 military, with the permission of the Canadian government,[94] tested herbicides, including Agent Orange, in the forests near the Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in New Brunswick in 1966 and 1967.
 On September 12, 2007, Greg Thompson, Minister of Veterans Affairs, announced that the government of Canada was offering a one-time ex gratia payment of $20,000 as the compensation package for Agent Orange exposure at CFB Gagetown.[95] Gagetown.[95]
 On July 12, 2005, Merchant Law Group LLP on behalf of over 1,100 Canadian veterans and civilians who were living in and around the CFB Gagetown filed a lawsuit to pursue class action litigation concerning Agent Orange and Agent Purple with the Federal Court of Canada.[96] Canada.[96]
 On August 4, 2009, the case was rejected by the court due to lack of evidence.
 The ruling was appealed.[97][98] appealed.[97][98]
  Queensland, AustraliaIn 2008 Australian researcher Jean Williams claimed that cancer rates in the town of Innisfail, Queensland were 10 times higher than the state average due to secret testing of Agent Orange by the Australian military scientists during the Vietnam War.
 Williams, who had won the Order of Australia medal for her research on the effects of chemicals on U.S.
 war veterans, based her allegations on Australian government reports found in the Australian War Memorial museum archives.
 A former soldier, Ted Bosworth, backed up the claims, saying that he had been involved in the secret testing.
 The Queensland health department claimed that cancer rates in Innisfail were not higher than those in other parts of the state.[99] state.[99]
  New ZealandThe use of Agent Orange has been controversial in New Zealand, because of exposure of New Zealand troops to it and because of the production of Agent Orange for Vietnam and other users at a Ivon Watkins-Dow chemical plant in Paritutu, New Plymouth.
 There have been continuing claims that the suburb of Paritutu has also been polluted; see New Zealand in the Vietnam War.[100] There are many cases of New Zealand soldiers developing cancers such as bone cancer from exposure to Agent Orange.
  BrazilThe Brazilian government used Agent Orange to defoliate a large section of the Amazon rainforest so that Alcoa could build the Tucuru� dam to power mining operations.
 Large areas of rainforest were destroyed, along with the homes and livelihoods of thousands of rural peasants and indigenous tribes.[101] tribes.[101]
  Malayan EmergencySmall scale defoliation experiments using 2-4-D and 2-4-5-T were conducted by the British during the Malayan Emergency in 1951.
 Areas of jungle close to roadways were cleared using chemical defoliation to help prevent ambushes by Communist Terrorists.[102] Terrorists.[102]
  Ontario, CanadaOn February 17, 2011, the Toronto Star revealed that the same toxins used to strip the jungles of Vietnam were also employed to clear extensive plots of Crown land in Northern Ontario.[103] The same day, in response to the Toronto Star article, the Ontario provincial government launched a probe into the use of Agent Orange.[104] Orange.[104]
 On February 18, 2011, Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources widened the probe of Agent Orange spraying to include all areas of the province where government managed forests on Crown land.[105] land.[105]
 The Toronto Star reported that, "records from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s show forestry workers, often students and junior rangers, spent weeks at a time as human markers holding red, helium-filled balloons on fishing lines while low-flying planes sprayed toxic herbicides including an infamous chemical mixture known as Agent Orange on the brush and the boys below." below."
 Organophosphorus Pesticides and Nerve Agents - Tabun (GA), Sarin (GB), Soman (GD), and VX VX
 Nerve agents are highly poisonous chemicals that work by preventing the nervous system from working properly.
 Nerve agents and other organophosphate pesticides cause acetylcholinesterase inhibition, resulting in signs and symptoms such as pinpoint pupils, eye pain, sweating, drooling, tearing, vomiting, and seizure, also known as Pesticide Syndrome.
 Hours after their arrival downtown, the hundreds of bees resting in a tree adjacent to Gerard�s Deli were dead, sprayed by a pest company.
 According to witnesses, a man in a Patriot Pest Management truck arrived at the tree on Central Avenue at about 2:30 p.m.
 and sprayed the bees using a hose attached to his truck.
 �He put on a jacket, gloves and a beekeeper�s mask and sprayed them,� said Evan Marques, an employee at Big O Tires, who was working across the street.
 �I thought they were going to daze them and remove them.
 I saw this big pile.
 I was surprised they didn�t clean them up.� up.�
 The bees fell to the ground in masses, some dead and others dying.
 An employee of Gerard�s Deli expressed her sadness and anger over the demise of the downtown visitors, which had arrived around 11 a.m.
 �It makes me sick,� Gigi Correll said.
 �That was unnecessary.
 You hear about the shortage of bees.
 They weren�t doing anyone any harm.
 I think it�s just wrong.
 Why?
 Why did they kill them?� them?�
 Tracy police spokesman Sgt.
 Tony Sheneman said no one at the police department called a pesticide company about spraying the bees.
 A pool of dying and dead bees, still soaked in the liquid sprayed on them, lay on the ground under the tree base and in the adjacent parking space an hour later.
 Many of the bees were still twitching.
 Fallen bees could be found yards away from the tree, scattered on the ground.
 Onlookers were stunned at the sight of the dead bees.
 �I was shocked,� said Dave Helm, of Helm�s Ale House at the corner of Tenth Street and Central Avenue.
 �I was amazed they were out there with pest control.� control.�
 He said he was surprised by the quantity of chemicals used by the Patriot agent.
 Question arose this afternoon regarding the protection of the honey bees and whether the spraying was legal.
 Gerard�s owner Lynn Gonsalves said there were two pest control workers eating in her restaurant at lunchtime, and when she asked if they were there for the swarm, they told her honey bees were protected by California law.
 �They said, �We can�t touch them, they�re protected,�� she said.
 The owner of Patriot Pest Management, Don Facciolla, said he was contacted by someone from the city in the early afternoon, asking him to get rid of the bees.
 He said he sprayed the bees with an orange peel extract, because city officials were worried about someone getting stung and they wanted to go on the side of safety.
 According to a California State Beekeepers Association representative, Carlen Jupe, the killing of the bees likely wasn�t illegal.
 �The bees are not a protected animal, as far as I know,� he said.
 �There has been reaction, at least in localities, to the colony collapse disorder (fewer honey bee populations) � people are saying we ought not to be killing them.
 This has to be balanced with some common sense.
 Can�t always collect the bees.
 �There was probably no need to kill those bees.� bees.�
 Jupe said spring is prime bee swarming time, and it�s not uncommon for his Salida-based group to get a few to 10 calls a week for bee swarms that have formed into a cluster.
 He said the Tracy bees could have been moving from an old hive and looking for a new home.

 Anthrax spore decontamination using hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid Resources Resources
 Questions On Pesticides?
 National Pesticide Information Center (NPIC) 1-800-858-7378 1-800-858-7378
 Current as of July 2007 2007
 Bleach, chlorine dioxide, ethylene oxide, hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid, methyl bromide, paraformaldehyde and vaporized hydrogen peroxide were pesticides used in federal decontamination responses to the bioterrorism attacks of October 2001.
 These attacks involved the intentional placement of Bacillus anthracis spores (the causative agent of the disease anthrax) into letters addressed to various locations on the East Coast of the United States.
 More information about biological threats.
 This page describes the Agency�s actions with regard to the chemicals used in the anthrax spore decontamination activities.
 EPA temporarily approved these pesticides for sale, distribution, and use based on the remediation action plans submitted for each specific site and only in accordance with the requirements of each crisis exemption under Section 18 of FIFRA.
 These chemicals were not intended for use by the general public.
 What is hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid?
 Hydrogen Peroxide is an oxidizing agent that is widely used as a disinfectant because of its reactive properties.
 In the home, hydrogen peroxide can be found in diluted form (3 percent); this formulation may be used to treat human cuts and scrapes.
 Hydrogen peroxide for industrial uses has a concentration of 30 percent or greater.
 Peroxyacetic Acid is also an oxidizing agent.
 Often mixed with hydrogen peroxide, peroxyacetic acid is used as a disinfectant and sanitizer, and is usually applied as a spray, or as a mop-on solution.
 Registration of pesticides containing hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid acid
 EPA first registered hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid as antimicrobial pesticides in 1977 and 1985, respectively.
 Both chemicals are approved only for indoor use on hard, non-porous surfaces.
 Use sites include:
 agricultural premises; premises;
 food establishments; establishments;
 medical facilities; facilities;
 home bathrooms; bathrooms;
 dairy/cheese processing plants; plants;
 on food processing equipment; and and
 pasteurizers in breweries, wineries, and beverage plants.
 Responding to emergencies under FIFRA FIFRA
 Under Section 18 of FIFRA, the EPA "may exempt any Federal or State agency from any provision of this Act if the Administrator determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption." To respond as rapidly as possible to the bioterrorism attacks, the Agency decided in 2001 to develop and issue the crisis exemptions itself.
 To obtain a crisis exemption from EPA for the unregistered use of a pesticide against anthrax, anyone who needed to use an antimicrobial product to inactivate Bacillus anthracis spores at contaminated sites had to submit:
 1.a written request to the Agency listing the antimicrobial product(s) to be used and describing how, when and where they would be used; used;
 2.data demonstrating efficacy of the product against bacillus spores; and and
 3.remediation, sampling, and monitoring plans specific to the location of use.
 Before issuing the exemption, EPA would review the request and the supporting information and then determine whether the product could be used safely and effectively (i.e., cause "no unreasonable adverse effects").
 If during this review any data were found to be deficient or missing, or any adverse human health or environmental concerns were identified, EPA could deny the exemption request.
 If a crisis exemption was issued and EPA determined that use of the product would be needed beyond the 15 day use period, EPA would complete an application for a public health exemption, allowing the crisis exemption to continue in effect until the application was either withdrawn or EPA issued a public health exemption.
 Crisis exemptions for hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid acid
 EPA reviewed data related to the safety and effectiveness of using hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid for inactivation of Bacillus anthracis spores.
 Published scientific data demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid would reduce bacterial spore populations under specific conditions including concentration, pH, and contact time.
 EPA determined that the product could be used safely and effectively, and that no unreasonable adverse effects would occur from the requested uses.
 Based on this review, EPA issued crisis exemptions for the limited sale, distribution, and use of four registered products containing both hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid acid
 1."Oxonia Active" (EPA Registration Number 1677-129) 1677-129)
 2."KX-6049" (EPA Registration Number 1677-158) 1677-158)
 3.Actril Cold Sterilant (EPA Registration Number 52252-7) 52252-7)
 4.Spor-Klenz Ready to Use (EPA Registration Number 52252-7-1043 52252-7-1043
 EPA also issued a crisis exemption for the unregistered product Virex STF, which contains only hydrogen peroxide.
 Under these crisis exemptions, the listed products could only be sold or distributed to employees of federal, state, or local government agencies, and the U.S.
 Postal Service for use in anthrax decontamination.
 Use of hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid for decontamination decontamination
 Applications of the five pesticide products mentioned above were limited to buildings or treatment sites identified by EPA or other federal, state, or local governmental authorities, or the United States Postal Service.
 Applications were conducted according to use instructions from federal, state, or local emergency response personnel following a plan that included the following steps:
 Pre-sampling to determine the extent of spore contamination at specific locations; locations;
 Spot remediation of highly contaminated surfaces through HEPA filter vacuuming; vacuuming;
 Gross surface decontamination with liquid chlorine dioxide; dioxide;
 Post-treatment sampling to determine that the anthrax decontamination has been effective; and and
 Re-treatment with liquid chlorine dioxide if viable spores are detected.
 These steps applied to facilities where the treated surfaces would be reused or the facility would be re-occupied.
 These steps did not necessarily apply to wastes or debris intended for disposal.
 Because the products differed in formulation, the directions for use also differed.
 The specific conditions of use for these products follow:
 Oxonia Active and KX-6049:
 Only hard surfaces may be treated; treated;
 A rate of 5,000 parts per million (ppm) peroxyacetic acid will be applied; this rate is achieved by adding 10 ounces Oxonia Active to 1 gallon of water, or 13 ounces.
 KX-6049 to 1 gallon of water; water;
 Applications will be made at room temperature (68� Fahrenheit, 20� Celsius); and and
 Treatments will have a contact time of at least 20 minutes.
 Actril Cold Sterilant and Spor-Klenz ready to use:
 Only hard surfaces may be treated; treated;
 Undiluted product will be applied; applied;
 Applications will be made at room temperature (68� Fahrenheit, 20� Celsius); and and
 Treatments will have a contact time of at least 10 minutes.
 Virex STF:
 Only hard surfaces may be treated; treated;
 Undiluted product will be applied; applied;
 Applications will be made at room temperature (68� Fahrenheit, 20� Celsius); and and
 Treatments will have a contact time of at least 15 minutes.
 Abstract:
 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):
 RMD Inc.
 proposes to develop direct reading, highly sensitive, reusable point sensors for detecting organophosphate and carbomate pesticide and nerve agent contamination in liquid and air.
 The sensors can be made for visual detection and handheld instrument readout using absorbance and fluorescence transduction modes, and will be suitable for unattended continuous monitoring.
 These sensors will be made using an ultra thin sensor coating fabrication technique which allows for fast response, high selectivity, and reusability.
 This technique is easy to carry out, is inexpensive, and does not require expensive chemical conjugation steps.
 The proposed sensor fabrication method also takes into account the challenges imposed by different liquid sample matrices.
 In the Phase I program, we will concentrate on developing sensor badges and optical probes for detection of pesticides in both air and aqueous samples.
 We will also study our evanescent wave probes for prototype fabrication in potential Phase II.
 In the Phase II program, we will complete the development of these sensors, fully characterize both sensor badges & fiber probes and develop instrument prototypes.
 Development of these new sensors will make it possible to conduct field monitoring of pesticide contamination of air, food and water sources both conveniently and cheaply.
 The sensors will also be useful in security applications in situation where organophosphates chemical agents are suspected.

 Good pesticide application recordkeeping recordkeeping
 by Rick Miller, County Extension Agent/Agriculture and Community Development Development
 Return to Crops and Livestock Agent Articles Articles
 Preparing for the application of pesticides this spring -- herbicides, fungicides, or insecticides � is a good time to review USDA requirements for pesticide recordkeeping.
 Although the recordkeeping requirements apply only to restricted use pesticides, it is a good idea to keep quality records for all pesticide applications.
 Record of restricted use pesticides required by the Feds Feds
 The Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade (FACT) Act of 1990, commonly called the 1990 Farm Bill, states that private applicators must record the use of any restricted use pesticides (RUP) they apply.
 Under the act, RUP application records must be maintained for two years from the date of application.
 The certified pesticide applicator should retain these RUP records, and must be able to make them accessible for copying by authorized regulatory and medical representatives.
 What's required in your recording keeping keeping
 There is no set method for recording the use of RUPs.
 Applicators can develop their own method.
 But there are requirements as to what must be recorded.
 For each field application the records must include:
 �Brand/product name name
 �EPA registration number (EPA Reg.
 No.) No.)
 �Total amount applied applied
 �Crop/commodity/site/stored product product
 �Field location location
 �Area treated treated
 �Application date date
 �Name of certified applicator and certification number (Cert.
 No.) No.)
 �Greenhouse and nursery applicators also must keep all the data elements shown above.
 When applying spot treatments with total area of less than one tenth of an acre, the private applicator must record the following information:
 Brand/product name; EPA registration number; Total amount applied; Location must be designated �spot treatment;� and Application date.
 �The following is a more detailed look at what is required for each of the record terms.
 �Record No.:
 Each application must be recorded individually, e.g., Record 1 - a preplant herbicide; Record 2 - an at-planting corn rootworm insecticide; Record 3 - a foliar fungicide, etc.
 �Application date:
 Must include month, day, and year.
 �Brand/Product:
 Is found on the front panel of the label, e.g., Ambush Insecticide, Atrazine 4L.
 �Amount:
 This is the �total amount,� or quantity of the formulated product used.
 It does not include the water or other carrying agent.
 For example, 3 qts; 2.5 gal.; 150 lb.
 (for a G or WP formulation product).
 �EPA Reg.
 No.:
 This is usually located in the lower part of the front label panel.
 It is a hyphenated set of numbers, e.g., 1234 56.
 Occasionally, there is a second hyphen.
 �NOTE:
 Do not record the EPA Est.
 No.
 �Location:
 This is the location of the application.
 It can be recorded as:
 1) county, range, township, and section; 2) a system using maps and/or written descriptions; 3) the field numbers designation used by USDA agencies; or 4) the legal property description.
 �Area Treated:
 This is the total area treated and should be in terms of the label directions, e.g., acres, linear feet, square feet, etc.
 For livestock and poultry, enter the number of animals treated.
 �Crop/commodity/site/stored product:
 Use general terms, e.g., wheat, corn, alfalfa, (do not use scientific or variety names).
 Commodity includes stored products such as grain or apples.
 Site is entered as livestock, fence rows, poultry, etc.
 �Applicator�s name:
 This is the name of the certified private applicator who made or supervised the application.
 It would be good to note the name of the applicator if it was not the certified applicator.
 �Cert.
 No.:
 This is the private applicator�s certification number (issued by the Kansas Department of Agriculture, or by a reciprocal state).
 Other valuable, but not required, information could include:
 �What the target pest(s) were � greenbugs, pigweeds, corn borer, etc.
 �Size/density of target pest � e.g., 100 (greenbugs or weeds) per row or square foot, foot,
 �larvae/adults (insects), seedling (weeds), etc.
 �Adjuvants, drift agents, and other additives used to enhance the application effectiveness.
 �Environmental conditions � Record as actual data or estimates.
 Wind speed should be recorded in miles per hour, not generalities such as calm, light etc.
 �Method of application �Examples are air, ground, chemigation, incorporation, etc.
 �Equipment used � This can be general, such as boom, band, aircraft; or specific equipment can be listed.
 �Reentry time/date (t/d)�For worker protection standards information.
 �Comments�This can relate to any aspect that may be helpful in the future.
 For example:
 3 days of cool temps (or other factors) occurred after application, which may reduce the pesticide�s level of control.
 Biopesticides are pesticides with living organism which intervene in life cycle of the insect pest and will kill it by causing diseases.
 Biopesticides are important in ecofriendly pest management.
 Many synthetic insecticides used during the last 40 years in Agriculture, forestry & household do not fulfill the requirement for IPM.
 Application of synthetic pesticides in crop protection has not only contributed effective management of insect pests but also lead to development of resistance against that insecticides & contamination of ground water and food stuffs.
 Neem, the versatile tree having many good and useful qualities is indigenous to India from where it has spread too many Asian & African countries.
 Neem and its allelo chemicals have variety of effect on pests.140 active components have been identified to date that occur in different parts of tree.
 The most important component identified has been the tetratripernoids the azadiractin It has low risk of pest resistance due to different mode of action, specific effect on pests.
 It specifically acts on Lepidopterons.
 Advantages Advantages
 � Insect die due to starvation starvation
 � Deterrence of growth growth
 � Egg sterility sterility
 �Interference in the process of Oviposition Oviposition
 Uses Uses
 � Ideal for IPM IPM
 � Neem oil can be used for seed treatment treatment

 An organophosphate (sometimes abbreviated OP) is the general name for esters of phosphoric acid.
 Phosphates are probably the most pervasive organophosphorus compounds.
 Many of the most important biochemicals are organophosphates, including DNA and RNA as well as many cofactors that are essential for life.
 Organophosphates are the basis of many insecticides, herbicides, and nerve gases.
 The EPA lists organophosphates as very highly acutely toxic to bees, wildlife, and humans. Recent studies suggest a possible link to adverse effects in the neurobehavioral development of fetuses and children, even at very low levels of exposure.
 Organophosphates are widely used as solvents, plasticizers, and EP additives.
 Organophosphates are widely employed both in natural and synthetic applications because of the ease with which organic groups can be linked together.
 Being a triprotic acid, phosphoric acid can form triesters whereas carboxylic acids only form monoesters.
 Esterification entails the attachment of organic groups to phosphorus through oxygen linkers.
 The precursors to such esters are alcohols.
 Encompassing many thousands of natural and synthetic compounds, alcohols are diverse and widespread.
 OP(OH)3 + ROH ?
 OP(OH)2(OR) + H2O H2O
 OP(OH)2(OR) + R'OH ?
 OP(OH)(OR)(OR') + H2O H2O
 OP(OH)(OR)(OR') + R"OH ?
 OP(OR)(OR')(OR") + H2O H2O
 The phosphate esters bearing OH groups are acidic and partially deprotonated in aqueous solution.
 For example, DNA and RNA are polymers of the type [PO2(OR)(OR')-]n.
 Polyphosphates also form esters; an important example of an ester of a polyphosphate is ATP, which is the monoester of triphosphoric acid (H5P3O10).
 Alcohols can be detached from phosphate esters by hydrolysis, which is the reverse of the above reactions.
 For this reason, phosphate esters are common carriers of organic groups in biosynthesis.

  Organophosphate pesticidesIn health, agriculture, and government, the word "organophosphates" refers to a group of insecticides or nerve agents acting on the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (the pesticide group carbamates also act on this enzyme, but through a different mechanism).
 The term is used often to describe virtually any organic phosphorus(V)-containing compound, especially when dealing with neurotoxic compounds.
 Many of the so-called organophosphates contain C-P bonds.
 For instance, sarin is O-isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate, which is formally derived from phosphorous acid (HP(O)(OH)2), not phosphoric acid (P(O)(OH)3).
 Also, many compounds which are derivatives of phosphinic acid are used as neurotoxic organophosphates.
 Organophosphate pesticides (as well as sarin and VX nerve agent) irreversibly inactivate acetylcholinesterase, which is essential to nerve function in insects, humans, and many other animals.
 Organophosphate pesticides affect this enzyme in varied ways, and thus in their potential for poisoning.
 For instance, parathion, one of the first OPs commercialized, is many times more potent than malathion, an insecticide used in combatting the Mediterranean fruit fly (Med-fly) and West Nile Virus-transmitting mosquitoes.
 Organophosphate pesticides degrade rapidly by hydrolysis on exposure to sunlight, air, and soil, although small amounts can be detected in food and drinking water.
 Their ability to degrade made them an attractive alternative to the persistent organochloride pesticides, such as DDT, aldrin and dieldrin.
 Although organophosphates degrade faster than the organochlorides, they have greater acute toxicity, posing risks to people who may be exposed to large amounts (see the Toxicity section below).
 Commonly used organophosphates have included parathion, malathion, methyl parathion, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dichlorvos, phosmet, fenitrothion[2] tetrachlorvinphos, and azinphos methyl.
 Malathion is widely used in agriculture, residential landscaping, public recreation areas, and in public health pest control programs such as mosquito eradication.[3] In the US, it is the most commonly used organophosphate insecticide.[4] Forty organophosphate pesticides are registered in the U.S., with at least 73 million pounds used in agricultural and residential settings.[5] settings.[5]
 They are of concern to both scientists and regulators because they work by irreversibly blocking an enzyme that�s critical to nerve function in both bugs and people.
 Even at relatively low levels, organophosphates may be most hazardous to the brain development of fetuses and young children.
 The EPA banned most residential uses of organophosphates in 2001, but they are still sprayed agriculturally on fruits and vegetables.
 They�re also used to control pests like mosquitos in public spaces such as parks.
 They can be absorbed through the lungs or skin or by eating them on food.[6] food.[6]
  Organophosphates as nerve agents History of nerve agentsEarly pioneers in the field include Jean Louis Lassaigne (early 19th century) and Philippe de Clermont (1854).
 In 1932, German chemist Willy Lange and his graduate student, Gerde von Krueger, first described the cholinergic nervous system effects of organophosphates, noting a choking sensation and a dimming of vision after exposure.
 This discovery later inspired German chemist Gerhard Schrader at company IG Farben in the 1930s to experiment with these compounds as insecticides.
 Their potential use as chemical warfare agents soon became apparent, and the Nazi government put Schrader in charge of developing organophosphate (in the broader sense of the word) nerve gases.
 Schrader's laboratory discovered the G series of weapons, which included Sarin, Tabun, and Soman.
 The Nazis produced large quantities of these compounds, though did not use them during World War II.
 British scientists experimented with a cholinergic organophosphate of their own, called diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), during the war.
 The British later produced VX nerve agent, which was many times more potent than the G series, in the early 1950s, almost 20 years after the Germans had discovered the G series.
 After World War II, American companies gained access to some information from Schrader's laboratory, and began synthesizing organophosphate pesticides in large quantities.
 Parathion was among the first marketed, followed by malathion and azinphosmethyl.
 The popularity of these insecticides increased after many of the organochlorine insecticides like DDT, dieldrin, and heptachlor were banned in the 1970s.
  Structural features of organophosphatesEffective organophosphates have the following structural features:
 A terminal oxygen connected to phosphorus by a double bond, i.e.
 a phosphoryl group group
 Two lipophilic groups bonded to the phosphorus phosphorus
 A leaving group bonded to the phosphorus, often a halide halide
  Terminal oxygen vs.
 terminal sulfurThiophosphoryl compounds, those bearing the P=S functionality, are much less toxic than related phosphoryl derivatives, which include sarin, VX and tetraethyl pyrophosphate.
 Thiophosphoryl compounds are not active inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase in either mammals or insects; in mammals, metabolism tends to remove lipophilic side groups from the phosphorus atom while in insects it tends to oxidize the compound, thus removing the terminal sulfur and replacing it with a terminal oxygen, which allows the compound to more efficiently act as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.
  Fine tuningWithin these requirements, a large number of different lipophilic and leaving groups have been used.
 The variation of these groups is one means of fine tuning the toxicity of the compound.
 A good example of this chemistry are the P-thiocyanate compounds which use an aryl (or alkyl) group and an alkylamino group as the lipophilic groups.
 The thiocyanate is the leaving group.
 One of the products of the reaction of Fc2P2S4 with dimethyl cyanamideIt was claimed in a German patent that the reaction of 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides with dialkyl cyanamides formed plant protection agents which contained six membered (P-N=C-N=C-S-) rings.
 It has been proven in recent times by the reaction of diferrocenyl 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide (and Lawesson's reagent) with dimethyl cyanamide that, in fact, a mixture of several different phosphorus-containing compounds is formed.
 Depending on the concentration of the dimethyl cyanamide in the reaction mixture, either a different six membered ring compound (P-N=C-S-C=N-) or a nonheterocylic compound (FcP(S)(NR2)(NCS)) is formed as the major product; the other compound is formed as a minor product.
 In addition, small traces of other compounds are also formed in the reaction.
 It is unlikely that the ring compound (P-N=C-S-C=N-) {or its isomer} would act as a plant protection agent, but (FcP(S)(NR2)(NCS)) compounds can act as nerve poisons in insects.
  Organophosphate poisoningMain article:
 Organophosphate poisoning poisoning
 Many organophosphates are potent nerve agents, functioning by inhibiting the action of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in nerve cells.
 They are one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, and are frequently intentionally used in suicides in agricultural areas.
 Organophosphorus pesticides can be absorbed by all routes, including inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption.
 Their toxicity is not limited to the acute phase, however, and chronic effects have long been noted.
 Neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (which is affected by organophosphate pesticides) are profoundly important in the brain's development, and many OPs have neurotoxic effects on developing organisms, even from low levels of exposure.
 Other organophosphates are not toxic, yet their main metabolites, such as their oxons are.
  Health effects Chronic ToxicityRepeated or prolonged exposure to organophosphates may result in the same effects as acute exposure including the delayed symptoms.
 Other effects reported in workers repeatedly exposed include impaired memory and concentration, disorientation, severe depressions, irritability, confusion, headache, speech difficulties, delayed reaction times, nightmares, sleepwalking and drowsiness or insomnia.
 An influenza-like condition with headache, nausea, weakness, loss of appetite, and malaise has also been reported.[7] reported.[7]
  Low level exposureEven at relatively low levels organophosphates may be hazardous to human health.
 The pesticides act on a set of brain chemicals closely related to those involved in ADHD, thus fetuses and young children, where brain development depends on a strict sequence of biological events, may be most at risk.[8] They can be absorbed through the lungs or skin or by eating them on food.
 According to a 2008 report from the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture, in a representative sample of produce tested by the agency, 28 percent of frozen blueberries, 20 percent of celery, 27 percent of green beans, 17 percent of peaches, 8 percent of broccoli and 25 percent of strawberries contained traces of organophosphate.[9] organophosphate.[9]
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency lists the organophosphate parathion as a possible human carcinogen.[10] carcinogen.[10]
 Chronic fatigue is common amongst those who consider their health is affected by pesticides and research from 2003 suggested there was an association between exposure to organophosphates and chronic fatigue symptoms.[11] symptoms.[11]
 A 2007 study linked the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos, which is used on some fruits and vegetables, with delays in learning rates, reduced physical coordination, and behavioral problems in children, especially ADHD.[12] ADHD.[12]
 A 2010 study has found that organophosphate exposure is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.[13] disease.[13]
 A 2010 study found that each 10-fold increase in urinary concentration of organophosphate metabolites was associated with a 55% to 72% increase in the odds of ADHD in children.[14][15][16] The study found that organophosphate exposure is associated with an increased risk of ADHD in children.
 Researchers analyzed the levels of organophosphate residues in the urine of more than 1,100 children aged 8 to 15 years old, and found that those with the highest levels of dialkyl phosphates, which are the breakdown products of organophosphate pesticides, also had the highest incidence of ADHD.
 Overall, they found a 35% increase in the odds of developing ADHD with every 10-fold increase in urinary concentration of the pesticide residues.
 The effect was seen even at the low end of exposure:
 children who had any detectable, above-average level of pesticide metabolite in their urine were twice as likely as those with undetectable levels to record symptoms of ADHD.
 Another 2010 study found that children who were exposed to organophosphate pesticides while still in their mother's womb were more likely to develop attention disorders years later.
 The researchers evaluated the children at age 3.5 and 5 years for symptoms of attention disorders and ADHD using maternal reports of child behavior, performance on standardized computer tests, and behavior ratings from examiners.
 Each tenfold increase in prenatal pesticide metabolites was linked to having five times the odds of scoring high on the computerized tests at age 5, suggesting a greater likelihood of a child having ADHD.
 The effect appeared to be stronger for boys than for girls.[17] girls.[17]
 In 2011 the results of three government-funded studies that charted "everyday" environmental exposures in hundreds of women and their children through pregnancy and into their grade school years was released.
 Though each study used a somewhat different way to track the pesticide exposures, they all reached strikingly similar conclusions�that many children exposed to higher levels of organophosphates during pregnancy than their peers are more likely to have lower IQs and may have more difficulty focusing on tasks or solving problems.
 In one study children who were exposed to the highest levels of organophosphates during pregnancy had IQ scores that were an average of 7 points lower than the IQ scores of those with the lowest pesticide exposures.
 It was found that genetics appear to play a strong role in whether exposure to organophosphates will cause damage.
 Two studies found that children exposed to higher levels of organophosphate pesticides than their peers were more likely to be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.[6][18] disorder.[6][18]
  Proposals to ban and restrictions of useAccording to the non-governmental organisation Pesticide Action Network, the organophosphate parathion is one of the most dangerous pesticides.[19] In the US alone more than 650 agricultural workers have been poisoned since 1966, of which 100 died.
 In underdeveloped countries many more people have suffered fatal and nonfatal intoxications.
 The World Health Organization, PAN and numerous environmental organisations propose a general and global ban.
 Its use is banned or restricted in 23 countries and its import is illegal in a total of 50 countries.[20] Its use was banned in the U.S.
 in 2000 and it has not been used since 2003.[20] 2003.[20]
 Other than for agricultural use, the organophosphate diazinon has been banned in the U.S.
 Agriculturally, more than one million pounds of diazinon were used in California to control agricultural pests in 2000.
 The areas and crops on which diazinon are most heavily applied are structural pest control, almonds, head lettuce, leaf lettuce and prunes.[21] prunes.[21]
 In May 2006 the Environmental Protection Agency reviewed the use of the organophosphate dichlorvos and proposed its continued sale, despite concerns over its safety and considerable evidence suggesting it is carcinogenic and harmful to the brain and nervous system, especially in children.
 Environmentalists charge that the latest decision was the product of backroom deals with industry and political interference.[22] interference.[22]
 In 2001 the EPA placed new restrictions on the use of the organophosphates phosmet and azinphos-methyl to increase protection of agricultural workers.
 The crop uses reported at that time as being phased out in four years included those for almonds, tart cherries, cotton, cranberries, peaches, pistachios, and walnuts.
 The crops with time-limited registration included apples/crab apples, blueberries, sweet cherries, pears, pine seed orchards, brussels sprouts, cane berries, and the use of azinphos-methyl by nurseries for quarantine requirements.[23] The labeled uses of phosmet include alfalfa, orchard crops (e.g.
 almonds, walnuts, apples, cherries), blueberries, citrus, grapes, ornamental trees (not for use in residential, park, or recreational areas) and non-bearing fruit trees, Christmas trees and conifers (tree farms), potatoes and peas.[24] Azinphos-methyl has been banned in Europe since 2006.[ 2006.[
 The formulation describes the physical state of a pesticide and determines how it will be applied.
 Pesticides are rarely applied full strength.
 The chemical in the pesticide formulation that actually kills the pest(s) is termed the active ingredient.
 The added chemical(s), those which make the product easy and safe to formulate or apply, are termed the inert ingredients.
 Common pesticide formulations follow.
 Emulsifiable concentrates (EC or E) E)
 The active ingredient is mixed with an oil base (often listed as petroleum derivatives) forming an emulsion which is diluted with water for application.
 ECs are common in the home garden trade, being easy to mix and use.
 They can cause a minor surface bronzing of light-colored fruit.
 They should be protected from freezing temperatures which can break down the emulsifier.
 Solutions (S) (S)
 These formulations are premixed, ready to use.
 They are often used in household pest products.
 Flowables (F or L) L)
 A flowable, or liquid, can be mixed with water to form a suspension in a spray tank.
 Aerosols (A) (A)
 These are very low-concentrate solutions, usually applied as a fine spray or mist.
 They are generally sold in aerosol cans and are a very expensive source of pesticide.
 Dusts (D) (D)
 Made by adding the active ingredients to a fine, inert powder or talc; generally used dry.
 Granules (G) (G)
 Granular formulations are made by adding the active ingredient to coarse particles (granules) of inert material like fired clay particles.
 Wettable powders (WP or W) W)
 Wettable powder formulations are made by combining the active ingredient with a fine powder.
 They look like dusts, but they are made to mix with water.
 These formulations need continuous agitation to maintain a suspension and are thus difficult for home gardeners to use.
 When mixing a WP, first mix the measured quantity with a small amount of water, forming a slurry, (a paper cup with a popsicle stick makes a good disposable mixing container) then add it and the additional water to the spray tank.
 The spray tank must be frequently shaken to maintain the suspension.
 Soluble powders (SP) (SP)
 Made of an active ingredient in powder form; dissolves in water.
 Baits (B) (B)
 A bait formulation is made by adding the active ingredient to an edible or attractive substance.
 Baits are often used to control slugs, snails, ground-dwelling insects, and rodents.
 Gardeners often attempt to compare a spray with a dust.
 It should be noted that dusts are a type of formulation, but sprays are not a formulation; they are one means of applying several different formulations such as wettable powders or emulsifiable concentrates that are mixed with water.
 SURFACTANTS, ADDITIVES, OR ADJUVANTS ADJUVANTS
 When added to a pesticide, a surfactant reduces the surface tension between two unlike materials, such as a spray film and a solid surface.
 For example, by adding a surfactant to a sprayer, oil and water will mix and can be sprayed on plant surfaces.
 With increasing emphasis on safe application of pesticides, such factors as droplet size, spray pattern, and pesticide drift have focused more attention on surfactants to give ideal coverage for pesticides.
 Surfactants include:
 activators; compatibility agents; deflocculators; detergents; dispersants; emulsifiers; foam and drift suppressants; and spreading, sticking, and wetting agents.
 These materials are added to a spray mix to help keep the pesticide in suspension; improve cohesiveness and dispersion of the spray; and increase the wetting (or coverage) of the leaves, fruits, and stems.
 This section focuses on surfactants that act as spreading, sticking, and wetting agents.
 They are most useful when spraying the hard-to-wet foliage of such plants as azalea, boxwood, camellia, carnation, conifer, euonymus, gardenia, gladiolus, holly, iris, narcissus, peony, rose, and yew.
 Whether a spray rolls off or sticks to a plant surface depends on the physical and chemical properties of the spray mixture and the physical properties of the surface itself.
 If the surface tension of the mixture is high, or if the plant surface is waxy, the spray droplets will roll off.
 A spreader or film extender (spreader-activator) is a substance that, when added to a pesticide mix, increases the area that a given volume of spray will cover and improves the contact between the pesticide and the plant surface.
 A spreading agent builds spray deposits and improves weatherability.
 Most wettable powder insecticides benefit from the addition of a spreader.
 A sticker or adhesive is a material that, when added to a spray mix or dust, improves the adherence (tenacity) to a plant surface rather than increasing the initial deposit.
 Commercial sticking agents are oily in consistency and increase the amount of suspended solids retained on plant surfaces by coating the particles with a resin or varnish-like film.
 Most fungicides, especially wettable powders, benefit greatly from the use of stickers.
 Stickers may be judged in terms of resistance to wind and water, length of adherence, and mechanical or chemical action.
 A wetting agent is a material that, when added to a pesticide, lowers the interfacial tension between a liquid and a solid; in this case, a plant surface.
 Effectiveness is measured by the increase in spread of a liquid over a solid surface and the ability of the spray film to make complete contact with it.
 When a wetting agent reduces surface tension, spreading naturally occurs.
 The pesticide label should state whether a surfactant is needed or should be added to a spray mix for certain applications and should indicate restrictions in the selection of compatible surfactants.
 In many cases, surfactants have been designed specifically for use with fungicides, insecticides, or herbicides.
 All commercial spreading, sticking, and wetting agents should be mixed strictly according to label directions.
 Adding more surfactant than recommended may cause excessive runoff, resulting in a poor spray deposit and reduced pest control.
 In general, if the spray mix contains one or more pesticides produced or formulated by the same company, use a surfactant sold or recommended by that company.
 Surfactants are sold separately from pesticides and are not subject to EPA registration.
 Although choosing an effective surfactant to accompany a specific pesticide is no simple task, the label will state whether a surfactant is needed and the brand that should be used.
 Commercial inorganic pesticides pose a genuine threat to the health of the environment, human health and the health of the soil and the plants that grow in it.
 Organic pesticides, while still designed to poison and kill certain life forms, use natural agents that work within existing biological systems.
 And while too much of any pesticide can have harmful effects, organic-based agents provide certain benefits and protections that inorganic pesticides don't.
 Chemical Exposures Exposures
 The widespread use of inorganic pesticides on crops and gardens can produce a range of human health effects, such as headaches, fatigue and neurological disorders, that result from the chemical toxins used in pesticide agents.
 Pesticide residues leach into groundwater supplies, appear on vegetable and fruit skins, and enter the atmosphere on a regular basis.
 According to the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency, the average American is exposed to pesticide residues as often as 70 times a day.
 And while organic chemical pesticides exist, these agents differ in terms of how they eliminate predatory insects, bacteria and fungi.
 Organic approaches target the processes that encourage harmful insects and bacteria to invade a particular plant or crop.
 Some organic pesticides act as preventative agents designed to repel certain insects while others may attack the larvae or eggs of a potential predator.
 Environmental Advantages Advantages
 The effects of inorganic pesticide chemicals absorbed into groundwater supplies impacts fish and wildlife populations while the target populations develop stronger resistances to pesticide agents.
 According to the U.S.
 Fish and Wildlife Service, bird mortality rates increase when birds consume insects and worms exposed to certain inorganic pesticide agents.
 And while chemical applications prove effective in eliminating certain pests, insects and bacteria often develop resistances to a particular agent.
 When this happens, stronger pesticides are developed and used.
 Ingredients used to make organic pesticides typically come from plant extracts or oils.
 Unlike inorganic applications that have widespread effects on nearby life forms, organic compounds target specific processes within soil and plant ecosystems.
 In effect, organic pesticides attempt to create unsuitable environments for certain populations of insects, bacteria and fungi.
 Plant & Soil Health Health
 The effects of inorganic pesticides on plant and soil health appear as chemical residues found inside plant tissue and on vegetable and fruit skin surfaces.
 Residues also appear inside soil environments, which can greatly alter a soil's natural ecosystem balance.
 Research compiled in 2000 by the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development reports on how apple orchards receive as many as 16 pesticide treatments a year.
 These findings were the basis for consumer warnings that cited the importance of thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables before eating.
 The research then goes on to encourage the use of organic farming methods as an alternative to using inorganic pesticides.
 As organic pesticides attempt to work within soil ecosystem processes, their usage helps to maintain soil nutrient levels and supports plant immune system defenses.

  HistoryPest control is at least as old as agriculture, as there has always been a need to keep crops free from pests.
 In order to maximize food production, it is advantageous to protect crops from competing species of plants, as well as from herbivores competing with humans.
 The conventional approach was probably the first to be employed, since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or plowing them under, and to kill larger competing herbivores, such as crows and other birds eating seeds.
 Techniques such as crop rotation, companion planting (also known as intercropping or mixed cropping), and the selective breeding of pest-resistant cultivars have a long history.
 In the UK, following concern about animal welfare, humane pest control and deterrence is gaining ground through the use of animal psychology rather than destruction.
 For instance, with the urban Red Fox which territorial behaviour is used against the animal, usually in conjunction with non-injurious chemical repellents.
 In rural areas of Britain, the use of firearms for pest control is quite common.
 Airguns are particularly popular for control of small pests such as rats, rabbits and grey squirrels, because of their lower power they can be used in more restrictive spaces such as gardens, where using a firearm would be unsafe.
 Chemical pesticides date back 4,500 years, when the Sumerians used sulfur compounds as insecticides.
 The Rig Veda, which is about 4,000 years old, also mentions the use of poisonous plants for pest control.
 It was only with the industrialization and mechanization of agriculture in the 18th and 19th century, and the introduction of the insecticides pyrethrum and derris that chemical pest control became widespread.
 In the 20th century, the discovery of several synthetic insecticides, such as DDT, and herbicides boosted this development.
 Chemical pest control is still the predominant type of pest control today, although its long-term effects led to a renewed interest in traditional and biological pest control towards the end of the 20th century.
  Causes Causes
 Sign in Ilfracombe, England designed to help control seagull presenceMany pests have only become a problem because of the direct actions of humans.
 Modifying these actions can often substantially reduce the pest problem.
 In the United States, raccoons caused a nuisance by tearing open refuse sacks.
 Many householders introduced bins with locking lids, which deterred the raccoons from visiting.
 House flies tend to accumulate wherever there is human activity and is virtually a global phenomenon, especially where food or food waste is exposed.
 Similarly, seagulls have become pests at many seaside resorts.
 Tourists would often feed the birds with scraps of fish and chips, and before long, the birds would become dependent on this food source and act aggressively towards humans.
 Living organisms evolve and increase their resistance to biological, chemical, physical or any other form of control.
 Unless the target population is completely exterminated or is rendered incapable of reproduction, the surviving population will inevitably acquire a tolerance of whatever pressures are brought to bear - this results in an evolutionary arms race.
  Types of pest control Biological pest controlMain article:
 Biological pest control control
 Biological pest control is the control of one through the control and management of natural predators and parasites.
 For example:
 mosquitoes are often controlled by putting Bt Bacillus thuringiensis ssp.
 israelensis, a bacterium that infects and kills mosquito larvae, in local water sources.
 The treatment has no known negative consequences on the remaining ecology and is safe for humans to drink.
 The point of biological pest control, or any natural pest control, is to eliminate a pest with minimal harm to the ecological balance of the environment in its present form. form.
  Elimination of breeding groundsProper waste management and drainage of still water, eliminates the breeding ground of many pests.
 Garbage provides food and shelter for many unwanted organisms, as well as an area where still water might collect and be used as a breeding ground by mosquitoes.
 Communities that have proper garbage collection and disposal, have far less of a problem with rats, cockroaches, mosquitoes, flies and other pests than those that don't.
 Open air sewers are ample breeding ground for various pests as well.
 By building and maintaining a proper sewer system, this problem is eliminated.
  Poisoned baitPoisoned bait is a common method for controlling rat populations, however is not as effective when there are other food sources around, such as garbage.
 Poisoned meats have been used for centuries for killing off wolves, birds that were seen to threaten crops, and against other creatures.
 this tool is also used to manage several caterpillars eg.Spodoptera litura,fruit flies,snails and slugs,crabs etc..
  Field burningTraditionally, after a sugar cane harvest, the fields are all burned, to kill off any insects or eggs that might be in the fields.
  HuntingHistorically, in some European countries, when stray dogs and cats became too numerous, local populations gathered together to round up all animals that did not appear to have an owner and kill them.
 In some nations, teams of rat catchers work at chasing rats from the field, and killing them with dogs and simple hand tools.
 Some communities have in the past employed a bounty system, where a town clerk will pay a set fee for every rat head brought in as proof of a rat killing.
  TrapsTraps have been used for killing off mice found in houses, for killing wolves, and for capturing raccoons and stray cats and dogs for disposal by town officials.
  Poison spraySpraying poisons by planes, hand held units, or trucks that carry the spraying equipment, is a common method of pest control.
 Throughout the United States of America, towns often drive a town owned truck around once or twice a week to each street, spraying for mosquitoes.
 Crop dusters commonly fly over farmland and spray poison to kill off pest that would threaten the crops.
 Many find spraying poison around their yard, homes, or businesses, far more desirable than allowing insects to thrive there.
  Space fumigationA project that involves a structure be covered or sealed airtight followed by the introduction of a penetrating, deadly gas at a killing concentration a long period of time (24-72hrs.).
 Although expensive, space fumigation targets all life stages of pests.[2] pests.[2]
  Space treatment treatment
 Residential & commercial building pest control service vehicle, Ypsilanti Township, MichiganA long term project involving fogging or misting type applicators.
 Liquid insecticide is dispersed in the atmosphere within a structure.
 Treatments do not require the evacuation or airtight sealing of a building, allowing most work within the building to continue but at the cost of the penetrating effects.
 Contact insecticides are generally used, minimizing the long lasting residual effects.
 On August 10, 1973, the Federal Register printed the definition of Space treatment as defined by the U.S.

 Another effective method of soil sterilization is soil steaming.
 Pest is killed through hot steam which is induced into the soil.
  Destruction of infected plantsForest services sometimes destroy all the trees in an area where some are infected with insects, if seen as necessary to prevent the insect species from spreading.
 Farms infested with certain insects, have been burned entirely, to prevent the pest from spreading elsewhere.

 The Pesticide Control Service (PCS) of the Department of Agriculture and Food is responsible for implementing the regulatory system for plant protection products and biocidal products (these latter include disinfectants, preservatives, pest control products, antifoulants etc.).
 PCS is also responsible for the national Regulations controlling pesticide residues in food.
 It is a legal requirement for horticultural producers to comply with Pesticide Regulations and their application/usage must be recorded.
 DAFF has a Pesticide Application Log to facilitate record keeping for Pesticides used.
 It is provided here in both a word and pdf document for immediate download.
 Pests are unwanted plants, animals, insects, germs or other organisms that interfere with human activity.
 They may bite, destroy food crops, damage property, or otherwise make our lives more difficult.
 Effective pest control requires some knowledge about the pest and its habits.
 The first step is to identify the pest correctly; the second step is to learn about its lifestyle.
 After that, you can evaluate strategies to control your pest.
 From the apple in your lunch box and the repellents that keep mosquitoes away, to the products that control mice in your attic, keep your pool clean and treat weed infestations on your lawn, pesticides touch many aspects of your daily life.
 Scientific evaluations are conducted on all pesticides in Canada before becoming available on the market.
 We determine if they meet our strict health and safety standards and dictate the use instructions and safety precautions on every product label.
 When using pesticides, you are responsible for reading and following these directions.
 The Pesticide Control Program (PCP) is primarily responsible for ensuring compliance with federal and state laws and regulations regarding the use, sale, transport, disposal, manufacture, and storage of pesticides in the state of New Jersey.
 It also promotes pollution prevention and pesticide use reduction through training and outreach activities involving Integrated Pest Management (IPM).
 The Program consists of the Bureau of Pesticide Operations, and the Bureau of Pesticide Compliance.

 Pesticides Control Board Headquarters Inauguration Inauguration
 31 March 2011 2011
 The Pesticides Control Board (PCB) is pleased to inform the general public of the completion of its Headquarters expansion and renovation project.
 The building was inaugurated on 31 March 2011 by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Cooperatives, Hon.
 Rene Montero.
 The PCB commenced its operations in May of 1988 with a staff of three under the leadership of its first Board Secretary, Dr.
 Robert Black who was also the Head of the Plant Protection Department of the Ministry of Agriculture.
 Board staff has grown to nine employees; a Registrar of Pesticides, six Technical Assistants, an Accountant/Secretary and a Janitor.
 The recently renovated and expanded PCB Headquarters building now houses a training/conference room which will be the venue for training workshops, as one of the PCB's primary activities is the training of farmers and other pesticide users in the rational management of pesticides.
 The new facilities now provide an improved work environment for Pesticides Control Board employees, collaborators and clients.

 Why control pesticides?
 Pesticides are used for the control of pests that affect agricultural production, buildings and health.
 The nature of these chemicals present certain risks to the applicators, the consumers and the environment.
 The control of pesticides is necessary to ensure that pesticide use does not result in unreasonable risk to health and the environment.
 Insect pests are an intimate part of every home.
 In the air, carpet, counter or cupboard, every home shares it's resources with these tiny, often unseen invaders.
 Pesticides are available for most common household insect pests, but these potent chemical compounds may be more harmful to you and the environment than the pests.
 Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household insect pests.
 Ants Ants
 The first line of defense is to remove the attractants:
 keep counters free of crumbs and sticky spots.
 Cover the sugar and put the honey jar in a plastic baggie.
 Cut off water sources such as drips or dishes left soaking overnight.
 If the ant invaders persist, try these simple measures:
 Keep a small spray bottle handy, and spray the ants with a bit of soapy water.
 Set out cucumber peels or slices in the kitchen or at the ants' point of entry.
 Many ants have a natural aversion to cucumber.
 Bitter cucumbers work best.
 Leave a few tea bags of mint tea near areas where the ants seem most active.
 Dry, crushed mint leaves or cloves also work as ant deterrents.
 Trace the ant column back to their point of entry.
 Set any of the following items at the entry area in a small line, which ants will not cross:
 cayenne pepper, citrus oil (can be soaked into a piece of string), lemon juice, cinnamon or coffee grounds.
 Mix one liter of water, one teaspoon of Borax and a cup of sugar.
 Soak cotton balls in the solution and place them in a small yogurt container with holes punched in the lids to allow ants access.
 Place container in a location where ants are present.
 Ants will carry the bait back to their colonies where it will eventually kill the colony.
 Important:
 use indoors only; must be kept away from pets and children.
 Leave a small, low wattage night light on for a few nights in the area of most ant activity.
 The change in light can disrupt and discourage their foraging patterns.
 Ants on the deck?
 Slip a few cut up cloves of garlic between the cracks.
 For long-term nontoxic control of ants, sprinkle diatomaceous earth where ants congregate.
 Clove oil-based commercial ant killers are available in two forms:
 AntEater organic ant killer, and BugShooter insect control spray.
 Dust Mites Mites
 Microscopic dust mites are everywhere in the home - in our beds, clothing, furniture, book shelves and stuffed animals.
 For people with allergies or asthma, dust mites are a problem.
 Here's how to reduce the dust mite population in your home:
 Vacuum mattresses and pillows.
 For people with sensitivities to dust mite allergens, dust mite bedding is available with zippered, allergen-impermeable encasings designed to block dust mites.
 Wash bedding at 55 degrees Celsius (130F) or higher.
 Detergents and commercial laundry products have no effect on mites unless the water temperature is high.
 Keep books, stuffed animals, throw rugs and laundry hampers out of the bedroom of allergy sufferers.
 Wash stuffed animals occasionally in hot water.
 Tannic acid neutralizes the allergens in dust mite and animal dander.
 Dust problem areas with tannic acid powder, available at health food stores and pet centers.
 Cover mattress and pillows with laminated covers which prevent penetration by dust mites.
 Avoid fabric-covered headboards.
 Cover heating ducts with a filter which can trap tiny dust particles smaller than 10 microns.
 Avoid using humidifiers.
 Dust mites thrive on warmth and humidity.
 Cockroaches Cockroaches
 The best defense against cockroaches is a clean kitchen and bathroom.
 If roaches are a problem in your home or apartment, vacuum well and wash the area with a strong soap.
 Dispose of the vacuum cleaner bag in a sealed container.
 Also try:
 Diatomaceous earth is a safe alternative which can be sprinkled in areas where roaches congregate, especially hidden areas such a cabinet tops and behind appliances.
 Harmless to people, the tiny particles cut the waxy exoskeleton and kills the insect within 48 hours.
 For a week or so after the treatment, the dehydrating insects will search more actively for water.
 Therefore, do not be surprised if you see roaches more often after the treatment.
 Most roaches should be killed within two weeks of application.

 Catnip is a natural repellent to cockroaches.
 The active ingredient is nepetalactone, which is non-toxic to humans and pets.
 Small sachets of catnip can be left in areas of cockroach activity.
 Catnip can also be simmered in a small amount of water to make a "catnip tea" which can be used as a spray to apply around baseboards and behind counters.
 This natural repellent should only be used in homes without cats! cats!
 Keep a spray bottle of soapy water on hand.
 Spraying roaches directly with soapy water will kill them.
 In an empty one pound coffee can, place 1 or 2 pieces of bread which have been soaked thoroughly with beer.
 Place in areas known to have roach infestations.
 It is a little known fact that roaches like high places.
 If you put boric acid on TOP of your kitchen cabinets (not inside), if space allows between ceiling and cabinets, the roaches will take the boric acid to their nests, killing all of them.
 Boric acid is toxic by mouth - keep away from children and pets.
 Leave bay leaves, cucumber slices or garlic in the affected area as deterrents.
 Non-toxic roach traps are commercially available.

 Fleas Fleas
 Fleas usually gain entry to your home through your pet or visitors' pets.
 For every flea on your pet, there may be as many as 30 more in the pet's environment.
 Before reaching for pesticides, try these safer choices:
 Bathe and comb your pet regularly.
 Use mild soap, not insecticides.
 If fleas are found on the comb, dip the comb in a glass of soapy water.
 Citrus is a natural flea deterrent.
 Pour a cup of boiling water over a sliced lemon.
 Include the lemon skin, scored to release more citrus oil.
 Let this mixture soak overnight, and sponge on your dog to kill fleas instantly.
 Do not use citrus oil on cats.
 Add brewer's yeast and garlic, or apple cider vinegar, to your pets' food.
 However, it is not advisable to use raw garlic as a food supplement for cats.
 Cedar shampoo, cedar oil and cedar-filled sleeping mats are commercially available.
 Cedar repels many insects including fleas.
 Fleas in the carpet?
 The carpet should be thoroughly vacuumed especially in low traffic areas, under furniture, etc.
 Put flea powder in the vacuum cleaner bag to kill any fleas that you vacuum up, and put the bag in an outdoor garbage bin.
 Trap fleas in your home using a wide, shallow pan half-filled with soapy water.
 Place it on the floor and shine a lamp over the water.
 Fleas will jump to the heat of the lamp and land in the water.
 The detergent breaks the surface tension, preventing the flea from bouncing out.
 In the yard or garden, plant fleabane (Fleabane Daisy Erigeron speciosus) to repel fleas.
 This is an annual growing 16-24" tall with violet, daisy like flowers.
 Nontoxic flea traps are available commercially.
 These traps are inexpensive and very effective.
 For long-term nontoxic control of fleas, sprinkle diatomaceous earth where fleas may occur.
 You can also rub diatomaceous earth into the fur of your cat or dog.

 Natural Flea Control Control
 The first line of defense against mosquitos is to seal their point of entry.
 Mosquitos are most active in the early morning and early evening.
 They seek areas of still air because they are hampered by breezes.
 Close windows and doors on the side of your house which are opposite the breeze.
 Then try:
 The most important measure you can take is to remove standing water sources.
 Change birdbaths, wading pools and pet's water bowl twice a week.
 Keep your eaves-troughs clean and well-draining.
 Remove yard items that collect water.
 Campers often report that the very best mosquito repellent is Herbal Armor, a nontoxic DEET-free repellent which is also recommended by National Geographic.
 If you're using the barbeque, throw a bit of sage or rosemary on the coals to repel mosquitos.
 An effective natural bug repellent, mix one part garlic juice with 5 parts water in a small spray bottle.
 Shake well before using.
 Spray lightly on exposed body parts for an effective repellent lasting up to 5 - 6 hours.
 Strips of cotton cloth can also be dipped in this mixture and hung in areas, such as patios, as a localized deterrent.
 Commercially available garlic based, all natural mosquito repellent and larvae killer will repel mosquitoes up to 4 weeks weeks
 Neem oil is a natural vegetable oil extracted from the Neem tree in India.
 The leaves, seeds and seed oil of the Neem tree contain sallanin, a compound which has effective mosquito repelling properties.
 Neem oil is a natural product and is safe to use.
 Planting marigolds around your yard works as a natural bug repellent because the flowers give off a fragrance bugs and flying insects do not like.
 Safe, nontoxic pheromone-based mosquito traps are now commercially available.
 For outdoor mosquito control, bat houses are effective.
 Some bat species can eat 500 - 1000 mosquitoes each per might.
 For broad application outdoor mosquito control, electric mosquito traps are commercially available.
 These traps do not use chemicals or propane gas.
 If you're stung, Ditch the Itch is a nontoxic cream which takes the itch out of bites.
 Is DEET safe?
 The active ingredient in most chemical-based mosquito repellents is DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide), developed by the US military in the 1940s.
 This powerful chemical is absorbed readily into the skin, and should be used with caution.
 Common side-effects to DEET-based products include rash, swelling, itching and eye-irritation.
 often due to over-application.
 For safer use, consider the following:
 ~ The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that repellents used on children contain no more than 10% DEET.
 Parents should assist children in applying DEET-based products.
 ~ Lotions can be applied more effectively than sprays.
 Only a thin layer should be used.
 ~ Be careful to avoid areas near the eyes or mouth.
 ~ Wash skin exposed to DEET after coming in from mosquito areas.
 ~ Minimize exposed skin areas by wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, if possible.
 Recent research suggests that DEET products, used sparingly for brief periods, are relatively safe.
 Other research points to toxic encephalopathy associated with use of DEET insect repellents.
 Experts warn that DEET shouldn�t be used in combination with sun-screen because DEET shouldn�t be reapplied often.
 Thai lemon grass grass
 (Cymbopogon citratus) is a natural and effective mosquito repellent.
 It contains the natural oil, citronella, which is safe and effective; in fact, lemon grass citronella is considered more effective than true citronella as an insect repellent.
 You can buy Thai lemon grass at garden centers and supermarkets, and it grows readily into a clump about 15" across and about 2ft tall.
 To use as a mosquito repellent, break a stalk off from the clump, peel off the outer leaves, until you find the scallion-like stem at the base.
 Bend the stem between your fingers, loosening it, then rub it vigorously between your palms - it will soon become a pulpy, juicy mass.
 Rub this over all exposed skin, covering thoroughly at least once.
 You can also make a tincture using alcohol, for spray applications.
 Plantings around the patio will also help repel mosquitoes.
 Herbal Armor� Armor�

 Flies Flies
 Use mint as a fly repellent.
 Small sachets of crushed mint can be placed around the home to discourage flies.
 Bay leaves, cloves and eucalyptus wrapped in small cheesecloth squares can be be
 hung by open windows or doors.
 Place a small, open container of sweet basil and clover near pet food or any open food in the house.
 A few drops of eucalyptus oil on a scrap of absorbant cloth will deter flies.
 Leave in areas where flies are a problem.
 You can make your own flypaper with this simple recipe:
 Mix 1/4 cup syrup, 1 tbsp.
 granulated sugar and 1 tbsp.
 brown sugar in a small bowl.
 Cut strips of brown kraft paper and soak in this mixture.
 Let dry overnight.
 To hang, poke a small hole at the top of each strip and hang with string or thread.
 A site visitor suggests a light spray of Pine Sol on affected areas will deter flies.
 Safe, nontoxic, pheromone-based outdoor and indoor fly traps are available.
 For outdoor fly infestations, the best trap you can use is the Flies Be Gone trap, now available in our online store.
 Bed Bugs Bugs
 The best defense against bed bugs is prevention, and this is easily achieved in rooms which have not yet been infected.
 If there is presence of bed bugs in a room, then a thorough cleaning and vacuuming is required, followed by preventive measures.
 Frequent travellers should be especially alert to early signs of bed bugs in the hoime.
 The first step in controlling bed bugs is to determine if there are bed bugs present in your home or hotel room.
 Non-toxic bed bug traps use heat, CO2, and a pheromone lure to attract bed bugs to a sticky glue surface.
 These traps are safe for air travel and can go in your luggage or carry-on bags.
 The best preventive measure against bed bugs is to apply non-toxic diatomaceous earth in the vicinity of bed bug activity.
 Be sure to use food-grade diatomaceous earth.
 Do not use pool-grade diatomaceous earth.
 Wash all bedding in hot water (120 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter).
 This will kill any bedbugs in the bedding.
 If you are sleeping in rooms where you suspect bed bug activity, non-toxic bed bug spray can be applied which kills bed bugs and their eggs on contact.
 It also acts to prevent bed bug activity for up to two weeks.
 This spray can be applied to mattresses, furniture, luggage and clothing.
 If there is a bed bug infestation, a thorough cleaning and vacuuming of the room is necessary.
 The most likely hiding places for bed bugs will be small cracks and crevices closest to where you sleep.
 The mattress and box spring should be lifted from the frame, and after vacuuming, sprinkle diatomaceous earth along the edges of the frame which holds the box spring.
 Personal items such as stuffed animals, blankets, etc.
 should be vacuumed and placed in plastic bags for several weeks.
 Other Home Insect Pests Pests
 Wasps Wasps
 Eartheasy has a separate page about natural wasp control.
 See Natural Wasp Control Control
 Moths Moths
 Cedar chips in a cheesecloth square, or cedar oil in an absorbant cloth will repel moths.
 The cedar should be 'aromatic cedar', also referred to as juniper in some areas.
 Homemade moth-repelling sachets can also be made using any of the following:
 bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, cloves, eucalyptus leaves, lavender, pepper corns or wormwood.
 Dried lemon peels are also a natural moth deterrent - simply toss into clothes chest, or tie in cheesecloth and hang in the closet.
 Natural attractant pheromones have been developed for controlling moths, and are now available as clothes moth traps and pantry moth traps.
 Earwigs Earwigs
 Diatomaceous earth is a safe and effective way to control earwigs in the home.
 One application in key spots (bathroom, baseboards, window frames) can be a long-term repellent.
 To trap earwigs, spray a newspaper lightly with water, roll it up loosely and secure with a string or rubber band.
 Place on the ground near earwig activity.
 The next morning pick up and discard the paper in a sealed container.
 Another method to trap earwigs is to take a shallow, straight-sided container and fill it half full with vegetable oil.
 Clean the trap daily; the oil can be re-used.
 Silverfish Silverfish
 Silverfish prefer damp, warm conditions such as those found around kitchen and bathroom plumbing.
 Start by vacuuming the area to remove food particles and insect eggs.
 Silverfish can be easily trapped in small glass containers.
 Wrap the outside with tape so they can climb up and fall in.
 They will be trapped inside because they cannot climb smooth surfaces.
 Drown them in soapy water.
 The best preventive control is to remedy the damp conditions.
 Nontoxic silverfish traps are also commercially available.
 Stink Bugs Bugs
 Stink bugs found indoors can usually be controlled with a vacuum cleaner.
 Attics can harbor stink bugs which migrate in living areas of the home.
 Diatomaceous earth can be applied in attic areas.
 especially near openings to the living areas.
 Nontoxic stink bug traps are also commercially available.

 Keeping pests in their place.
 The Bureau of Entomology and Pest Control has the primary responsibility of protecting Florida citizens and visitors from pestiferous and disease carrying insects, unsafe pest control practices and unscrupulous pest control operators.
 Pest Control Section Section
 The Pest Control Section regulates and licenses the pest control industry which consists of about 3,800 companies, 6,600 certified operators and 225 special identification cardholders.
 The major components of the Pest Control Section are document issuance, enforcement, training and certification.
 The field inspectors conduct inspections of licensed pest control business locations and investigate consumer complaints filed against pest control companies.
 Qualified businesses desiring to engage in pest control activities must be licensed.
 A license is required for each business location.
 Proof of insurance coverage for bodily injury and property damage is required.
 Pest control supervisory level employees and pest control operators must be certified before engaging in pest control activities.
 Pest Control employees, other than pest control operators, are required to have identification cards.
 Special identification cards are required for specific pest control treatments, such as fumigation.
 1.When is a pest control business license required?
 Chapter 482, F.S., defines pest control activity as:
   The law provides for some exemptions.
 The chapter does not apply to "pest control, except for fumigation, performed by a person upon his own individual residential property".
 Furthermore, pest control performed in greenhouses, plant nurseries, on agricultural crops, trees, groves, orchards and other agricultural areas is exempt from regulation under Chapter 482, F.S.
 Other agricultural areas identified herein include golf courses, parks, cemeteries, or areas where farming of any type is performed or livestock is raised.
 These operations are covered under Chapter 487, F.S., and are enforced by the Bureau of Pesticides in Tallahassee.
 2.Can one make pesticide applications to their private property?
 Yes, you can make pesticide applications to your residential property.
 If you own property, other than your own residential property, you are required to obtain "Limited Certification" from this Bureau for each applicator if using or mixing pesticide concentrates or restricted use materials.
 Limited Certification is not required for the application of disinfectants, sanitizers, or ready-to-use pesticides sold over the counter at retail (although we still recommend that you obtain certification for your applicators for safety and technical reasons).
 3.How does one report a problem or file a complaint?
 We ask that you first try to resolve your problem directly with the pest control company involved.
 Ask to speak to the certified pest control operator or branch manager directly.
 In larger companies there are regional or divisional managers and/or corporate officers that you can discuss your situation with.
 Departmental procedures require a written consumer complaint be filed to initiate an investigation.
 Please complete a complaint form and submit it, with supporting documents, to your local field office by fax or mail.
 You may contact your local inspector directly.
 Please remember the inspectors spend most of their time in the field investigating complaints.
 Please use their recorders to leave messages.
 You may also contact Bureau Headquarters at 1203 Governors Square Boulevard, Suite 300, Tallahassee, FL, 32301, in writing or by phone (850) 617-7997 anytime, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m.
 to 5 p.m., (except for holidays).
 Please be advised that the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has no authority under the Structural Pest Control Act, Chapter 482, F.S., to arbitrate any claims for personal or property damage or adjudicate settlement.
 If you wish to pursue these matters you may want to consult an attorney for legal options.
 Anonymous written complaints will be investigated on a lower priority based on the merit and context of the information provided.
 4.Is there an established procedure to investigate a company's complaint history?
 Yes, a company's complaint history is public information.
 When requested, we will review the company's file and report any written consumer complaint in the file for the last three years.
 We will disclose the type of complaint and its resolution.
 Please remember that the number of complaints is not necessarily as important as the complaint disposition.
 Many companies resolve their complaints when the matter is brought to their attention.
 Also, it would be reasonable to expect that a larger company with more customers may have more complaints than a smaller company.
 If shopping for pest control services, please request ONLY the final two or three companies you are thinking of using.
 We physically must go and review the files and it is easier for us to pull all of the company files that you have an interest in at one time.
 Copies of our records, for up to three years, are available.
 We request that you provide a written request for duplication of the files to receive copies of the actual complaint(s) of record.
 The present fee schedule for duplication of record(s) is fifteen (15) cents for single sided pages and twenty (20) cents for two sided copies.
 Additional fees apply when extensive clerical or supervisory time is needed to fulfill your request.
 We can calculate the cost of duplication in advance.
 Please contact us at the Bureau of Entomology and Pest Control, 1203 Governors Square Boulevard, Suite 300, Tallahassee, Florida 32301, telephone (850) 617-7997.
 5.What is a Certified Pest Control Operator?
 certified operator is an individual that has passed an examination administered by the Department in any of four (4) certification categories.
 The categories that a person can be certified in are:
 General Household and Rodent Control; Lawn and Ornamental Pest Control; Termite and Other Wood-Destroying Organisms Control; and Fumigation.
 A person can be certified in just one or all four categories.
 A company's pest control operations are the responsibility of the certified operator in charge and the business operations are limited to the category (or categories) possessed by the certified operator (or operators) in charge at the business location.
 6.How does one become a certified pest control operator?
 A person must first meet the qualification requirements to take any of the certification exams.
 Section 482.132, F.S., Qualification for examination and certification - states the minimum qualification requirements.
 Examinations are offered quarterly.
 If qualified, you make application directly to this office.
 You can request and print an Application for Examination.
 The application must be completely filled out and requires a photograph to be attached.
 Your application must be postmarked by midnight of the application deadline date established for each exam.
 7.How does one find the local State Inspector?
 We have set up another area in our site that has a map of the State of Florida by counties.
 Just click on your county and your local inspector will be displayed at the top of the page.
 (You can check the list of counties beside his/her region to make sure your county is listed).
 8.How many inspectors are there?
 The Bureau of Entomology and Pest Control presently has 19 field inspector positions located in different areas of the State.
 There are presently two (2) field supervisors.
 9.How does one know if a company is licensed?
 It is not wise to use an unlicensed pest control operator.
 Most do not have insurance and cleaning up a contaminated house resulting from misuse of pesticides can be very expensive and not worth the couple of dollars you saved.
 An unlicensed pest control operator might use an agricultural pesticide indoors or use the incorrect pesticide entirely.
 Some consumers have paid in advance for a year of service and then complained to us when the person disappears with their money.
 Our regulations require that all sales and service vehicles used for pest control be marked on both sides of the vehicle with the licensee's business name as registered with our Department.
 Check to see if the vehicle is marked.
 Be suspicious if any person asks you to make your check out to cash or to them personally.
 Don't participate in "Under the table payments" to avoid "taxes" or any other reason, it is illegal.
 Occasionally, an employee will begin stealing from a pest control company and not turn in moneys collected on their route.
 Check your statements closely, and it wouldn't hurt to contact the office every now and then to check on your balance.
 Moonlighting by pest control identification cardholders (employees) is prohibited by law.
 We will not hold a company responsible for stolen contracts although most companies will attempt to resolve the issues with you and pursue criminal action against the thief.
 The State issues a numbered pest control business license to all active pest control companies annually.
 You could request the company to supply you with a copy of this document.
 Business license numbers will begin with a pre-fix of "JB".
 You are always welcome to contact our office and verify that the company/person is licensed.
 We can be reached at (850) 617-7997, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m.
 to 5:00 p.m.
 (except for holidays).
 10.How does one obtain a business license?
 A business license must be issued to you BEFORE you begin any pest control services.
 You will not be able to get a local 'business tax' license (formerly known as occupational license) until you have been issued a business license by our agency.
 The pest control activities for your company must be under the direction of a certified operator possessing the category or categories that you would like to operate within.
 The certified operator is required to endorse or sign your business license application.
 Presently, the licensing fee is THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($300) and TEN DOLLARS U.S.
 ($10) per employee for the identification card.
 The law requires a pest control business to maintain a minimum amount of insurance coverage.
 Presently those limits are set at $250,000 each person and $500,000 each occurrence for bodily injury and $250,000 each occurrence and $500,000 in the aggregate for property damage or a combined single limit coverage of $500,000 in the aggregate aggregate
 11.What is Limited Certification?
 Chapter 482.155, F.S., requires that individuals applying both general use and restricted use pesticides as a governmental employee or as a private property owner or employee thereof must qualify to do such pesticide application by taking and passing a limited certification exam or be trained and supervised by a Chapter 482, F.S., certified pest control operator.
 Examples of pesticide applicators that come under this measure would include individuals who apply pesticides to buildings or lawn and ornamentals associated with these buildings such as:
 government buildings (schools, agency offices, etc.) and commercial buildings (banks, groceries, apartments, condominium common areas, hotels, restaurants, etc.).
 Individuals performing pest control (other than fumigation) upon their own individual residential property are exempted from these requirements.
 An examination fee of $150 and a renewal fee of $25 every four years thereafter shall be required in each category.
 Presently there are two categories available:
 Structural Pest Control, and Lawn and Ornamental Pest Control.
 Application is made directly to this Bureau and, upon approval, an admission slip is issued to you.
 The admission slip is taken to your local County Extension office where the examination is administered.
 The examination is then returned to the Bureau for grading and issuance of credentials for passing exam grades.
 CERTIFICATION OBTAINED UNDER THIS SECTION DOES NOT AUTHORIZE A PERSON TO OPERATE A PEST CONTROL BUSINESS.
 12.Can lawn maintenance companies make pesticide applications on an individual's property?
 No, lawn maintenance companies cannot make pesticide applications to turf areas of your property.
 Presently, lawn maintenance companies are restricted to making only fertilizer applications within turf areas.
 They cannot make "weed-n-feed" applications or use granular fertilizers with pesticides incorporated within them.
 Lawn maintenance companies can cut, mow, edge, use blowers and physically pull weeds anywhere within your turf or plant bed areas.
 Section 482.156, F.S., allows certification of commercial landscape personnel and authorizes certified applicators to apply herbicides, fungicides and insecticides with the signal word of "caution" to plant beds and the ornamental plants.
 These applicators are limited to portable, handheld three gallon compressed air sprayers or backpack sprayers having no more than a five gallon capacity, and they may not use any power equipment.
 Individuals certified under section 482.156, F.S., are issued a numbered identification card that is carried on the person.
 Their number will begin with a "LC".
 You should ask to see this credential.
 This program certifies the individual applicator and not the company.
 In order for us to verify that your lawn maintenance company is certified to make limited applications to plant bed areas and to ornamental plants you will need to know the applicator's name.
 We can be reached Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m.
 to 5:00 p.m., at (850) 617-7997.
 CERTIFICATION UNDER THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT AUTHORIZE:
 ?Application of pesticides to turf.
 ?Operation of a pest control business, or or
 ?The application of pesticides by unlicensed or uncertified personnel under the supervision of the certified person.
 13.Can someone operate a pest control business from their house?
 Chapter 482, F.S., does not prohibit or restrict the location of the pest control business.
 Many small companies work directly from their house.
 The location from which someone can operate a business is usually regulated by a county or municipal zoning regulation.
 14.How does one find out more information about a particular pesticide?
 To discuss pesticides, you will need to know the trade name or common chemical name of the product that was used (or is planned to be used).
 Pest control companies are required to provide a customer, upon request, the following:
 (1) their business name or name of the limited certificate holder; (2) the applicator's ID card number or limited certificate number; (3) the common or brand name of the pesticide used and the common name of the active ingredient in that pesticide; (4) the appropriate safety information pertaining to the pesticide product to be used, as provided on the label for the product.
 For further information about pesticides, we recommend that you contact the National Pesticide Telecommunication Network (NPTN) at 1-800-858-7378.
 This organization is funded by the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and operates from 6:30 a.m.
 to 4:30 p.m.
 pacific time (9:30 a.m.
 to 7:30 p.m.
 eastern).
 It is staffed with toxicologists who will always err to the side of safety and worse case scenarios for most discussions.
 15.Can a condominium or homeowner's association make pesticide applications to private property?
 Hotel and motel maintenance staff (or other employee(s) of the hotel and motel) can make pesticide applications to all areas of the company's property (including inside individual units) since there is no ownership associated with the renting of the units.
 An applicator should have the appropriate category of Limited Certification.
 Condominiums may allow maintenance staff (or other employee(s) of the association) to make pesticide applications to the common areas of the property such as a building's hallway, lobby, elevator, utility room, laundry room, (etc.) and the exterior grounds.
 Condominium employees may not make applications within an individual unit.
 An applicator should have the appropriate category of Limited Certification.
 Homeowner Associations may allow maintenance staff (or other employee(s) of the association) to make pesticide applications to the common areas owned by the associations such as entrance berms and right-of-way areas.
 Homeowner association employees may not make applications to each individual property owner's lawn or structure.
 An applicator should have the appropriate category of Limited Certification.
 In all of the above cases, the individual property or unit owner could make pesticide applications to their own individual residential property.
 Also, any of the groups above could contract with a licensed pest control company to provide the pest control services on behalf of the entire community.
 Property management firms, and/or janitorial or housekeeping firms and their employee(s) are not allowed to make any pesticide applications to any property (or properties) they manage or service unless they are licensed with this agency as a pest control business.
 16.Is a list of all pest control companies, certified operators and applicators, etc.
 available through the Department?
 We're sorry, but at the present, we do not have the resources to provide any type of listing for any of the different groups that we license or certify.
 The information is public record and you are welcome to visit our headquarters office in Tallahassee, Florida and compile the information you need directly from our licensing or certification documents.
 Here are some important reminders on how to use the Nuvan pest strips.
 We, at Pest Mall, are presenting these guidelines because recently we have received complains on the failure of these Nuvan pest strips to do their magic.
 The first thing to remember is to make sure you have an insect infestation and also if the target insect is on the product label.
 After you have concluded that you do have an infestation and you are getting ready to use Nuvan, continue to read the label carefully.
 The label for Nuvan Prostrips is pretty specific on the places where they should and should not be used.
 They are to be used only within closets, wardrobes and cupboards.
 Some other places that they can be used on are attics, garages and enclosed spaces.
 Crawl spaces and pantries can also be considered.
 They can also be placed in airtight sealed bags.
 The Nuvan Prostrips, clearly, are to be not used in places that are occupied by children, pets, and adults.
 The Nuvan pest strips should also stay in the area for a minimum of 7 days, even up to 2 weeks.
 So unless the residents in the home are not occupying the area for at least a week, the use of Nuvan is off-label and prohibited.
 The Nuvan Prostrips are also recommended to be used for electronic equipments and other non � washable items.
 These equipments should be put in a sealed plastic and the Vapona strips should be inside.
 This method is a great way to save the appliances and electronic gadgets which might be home for bed bugs and some other pests, from being disposed.
 If you follow the label, there should not be a problem with the effectiveness of Nuvan and its means of controlling a variety of insects in and around your home.
 However, it is direly important that you do follow the product label for Nuvan, let alone other pesticides, before you apply.
 Read up on the product before purchase and thoroughly review the product label and MSDS label.
 If you have any questions on the product and how you apply the product or any other products for that matter, feel free to give us a call at 1-800-788-4142.[+] Read More(Click Here)America's Favorite Commercial Center for Pest Control Products Products

 What are pesticide control orders?
 Pesticide control orders are orders that are issued under section 38 of the Pesticides Act 1999.
 They are made for any purpose relating to the protection of public health, property, the environment or trade or to implement a decision or policy of the Australian Pesticides & Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) in relation to use of a pesticide or a class of pesticide.
 How do these orders operate?
 A pesticide control order may:
 prohibit or control the use of a pesticide or a class of pesticide, or or
 authorise the use or possession of a restricted pesticide.
 What is a restricted pesticide?
 A restricted pesticide is a pesticide that may:
 have a harmful effect to humans, humans,
 have an unintended effect that is harmful to any animal, plant or to the environment, environment,
 require special knowledge, skill or qualifications in their preparation or handling, handling,
 require special equipment to use the product safely.
 The APVMA determines which pesticides meet any of the above criteria and in turn determine what special controls should be placed on the supply and use of such pesticides.
 Restricted pesticides upon their declaration, are listed in Schedule 4 of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Regulations 1995.
 Why does the DECC issue pesticide control orders?
 The Pesticides Act 1999 requires a person who uses a restricted pesticide to be authorised to do so by way of either a pesticide control order or a certificate of competency.
 DECCW generally issues pesticide control orders to allow the possession and use of restricted pesticides in NSW.
 Pesticide control orders are primarily issued to implement an APVMA policy, that is, to implement outcomes of a pesticide review.
 These orders also need to specify authorised users and the manner in which a pesticide can be used in NSW.
 Each pesticide control order is published in the NSW Government Gazette and commences on the date specified in the order.
 An advertisement is also placed in certain newspapers so that a wide array of persons are made aware that DECCW has made these orders.
 Details of availability of the pesticide control order are provided in the advertisement.
 The majority of pesticide control orders in force in NSW relate to use of restricted pesticides.
 One order (Air-1) sets rules for aerially applying pesticides within 150 metres of a dwelling, school, factory or public place.
 Another order (bromadiolone) relates to control of mouse plagues by perimeter baiting of crops.
 Each order is a PDF file for which you will require Acrobat Reader.

 New 1080 pesticide control order order
 On 6 August 2010 a new pesticide control order - Pesticide Control (1080 Liquid Concentrate and Bait Products) Order 2010 commenced.
 Download 2010PCO1080.pdf (258kb).
 1080 is a restricted pesticide.
 1080 can only be used by those people who are authorised to use it.
 This new pesticide control order sets out who can use 1080 baits to control specific pest animals.
 If you plan to use 1080 you must read this pesticide control order and the relevant schedule for the pest animal you need to control.
 Some new conditions have been introduced to achieve better environmental outcomes.
 The changes follow a DECC review of 1080 bait use in NSW and take into account the findings of the APVMA's review of 1080 products.
 A new 1080 and pindone training course has been developed for those persons that need to use these pesticides.
 Contact your local Livestock Health and Pest Authority office for further details.
 Note:
 The 1080 and pindone course only allows persons to use 1080 and pindone.
 Persons who use other pesticides are still required to meet the general training requirements under the Pesticides Regulation 2009.
 Where can I find out more?
 For more information about the new 1080 pesticide control order see:
 1080 Fact sheet sheet
 More information about pesticide control orders can be obtained by calling DECCW's Environment Line on 131 555 (cost of a local call).
 What happens if I do not comply with a pesticide control order?
 DECCW regulates the use of pesticides in NSW.
 Strict penalties may apply if you do not comply with a pesticide control order.
 Under the Pesticides Act 1999, the maximum penalty that a court can impose for failing to comply with a pesticide control order is $60,000 for an individual and $120,000 for a corporation.

 Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an ecosystem approach to crop production and protection that combines different management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and minimize the use of pesticides.
 FAO promotes IPM as the preferred approach to crop protection and regards it as a pillar of both sustainable intensification of crop production and pesticide risk reduction.
 As such, IPM is being mainstreamed in FAO activities involving crop production and protection.
 The FAO IPM programme currently comprises three regional programmes (Asia, Near East and West Africa) and several stand-alone national projects.
 Under these programmes and projects, FAO provides assistance in capacity building and policy reform, and facilitates collaboration among ongoing National IPM Programmes.
 Asia:

 The West African Regional Integrated Production and Pest Management (IPPM) Programme, a case study, 2011 (1.68 MB) MB)
 FAO definition:
 Integrated Pest Management (IPM) means the careful consideration of all available pest control techniques and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of pest populations and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that are economically justified and reduce or minimize risks to human health and the environment.
 IPM emphasizes the growth of a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms.

 Pesticides are substances or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling or mitigating any pest. A pesticide may be a chemical, biological agent (such as a virus or bacterium), antimicrobial, disinfectant or device used against any pest.
 Pests include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, molluscs, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, spread disease or are vectors for disease or cause nuisance.
 Although there are benefits to the use of pesticides, some also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other animals.
 According to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, 9 of the 12 most dangerous and persistent organic chemicals are pesticides.
 Pesticides are categorized into four main substituent chemicals:
 herbicides; fungicides; insecticides and bactericides.[2][3] bactericides.[2][3]

  DefinitionFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has defined the term of pesticide as:
 any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying or controlling any pest, including vectors of human or animal disease, unwanted species of plants or animals causing harm during or otherwise interfering with the production, processing, storage, transport or marketing of food, agricultural commodities, wood and wood products or animal feedstuffs, or substances which may be administered to animals for the control of insects, arachnids or other pests in or on their bodies.
 The term includes substances intended for use as a plant growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant or agent for thinning fruit or preventing the premature fall of fruit.
 Also used as substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.[4] transport.[4]

 Subclasses of pesticides include:
 herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, pediculicides, and biocides.[3][5] biocides.[3][5]
 Pesticides can be classified by target organism, chemical structure, and physical state.
[6] Pesticides can also be classed as inorganic, synthetic, or biologicals (biopesticides),[6] although the distinction can sometimes blur.
 Biopesticides include microbial pesticides and biochemical pesticides.
[7] Plant-derived pesticides, or "botanicals", have been developing quickly.
 These include the pyrethroids, rotenoids, nicotinoids, and a fourth group that includes strychnine and scilliroside.
[8]:15 scilliroside.[8]:15
 Many pesticides can be grouped into chemical families.
 Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates.
 Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g.
 DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, and other related compounds.
 They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously.
 Their toxicities vary greatly, but they have been phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate.[8]:239-240 Organophosphate and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines.
 Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis.
 Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates, and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates.[8]:136-137 Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates.
 Prominent families of herbicides include pheoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g.
 2,4-D), triazines (e.g.
 atrazine), ureas (e.g.
 diuron), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g.
 alachlor).
 Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broadleaved weeds rather than grasses.
 The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plants nutrient transport system.
[8]:300 Triazines interfere with photsynthesis.[8]:335 Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.
 Pesticides can be classified based upon their biological mechanism function or application method.
 Most pesticides work by poisoning pests.[9] A systemic pesticide moves inside a plant following absorption by the plant.
 With insecticides and most fungicides, this movement is usually upward (through the xylem) and outward.
 Increased efficiency may be a result.
 Systemic insecticides, which poison pollen and nectar in the flowers, may kill bees and other needed pollinators.
 In 2009, the development of a new class of fungicides called paldoxins was announced.
 These work by taking advantage of natural defense chemicals released by plants called phytoalexins, which fungi then detoxify using enzymes.
 The paldoxins inhibit the fungi's detoxification enzymes.
 They are believed to be safer and greener.[10] greener.[10]
  UsesPesticides are used to control organisms that are considered to be harmful.[11] For example, they are used to kill mosquitoes that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like west nile virus, yellow fever, and malaria.
 They can also kill bees, wasps or ants that can cause allergic reactions.
 Insecticides can protect animals from illnesses that can be caused by parasites such as fleas.[11] Pesticides can prevent sickness in humans that could be caused by moldy food or diseased produce.
 Herbicides can be used to clear roadside weeds, trees and brush.
 They can also kill invasive weeds that may cause environmental damage.
 Herbicides are commonly applied in ponds and lakes to control algae and plants such as water grasses that can interfere with activities like swimming and fishing and cause the water to look or smell unpleasant.
[12] Uncontrolled pests such as termites and mould can damage structures such as houses.[11] Pesticides are used in grocery stores and food storage facilities to manage rodents and insects that infest food such as grain.
 Each use of a pesticide carries some associated risk.
 Proper pesticide use decreases these associated risks to a level deemed acceptable by pesticide regulatory agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Canada.
 Pesticides can save farmers' money by preventing crop losses to insects and other pests; in the U.S., farmers get an estimated fourfold return on money they spend on pesticides.[13] One study found that not using pesticides reduced crop yields by about 10%.
[14] Another study, conducted in 1999, found that a ban on pesticides in the United States may result in a rise of food prices, loss of jobs, and an increase in world hunger.[15] hunger.[15]
 DDT, sprayed on the walls of houses, is an organochloride that has been used to fight malaria since the 1950s.
 Recent policy statements by the World Health Organization have given stronger support to this approach.[16] Dr.
 Arata Kochi, WHO's malaria chief, said, "One of the best tools we have against malaria is indoor residual house spraying.
 Of the dozen insecticides WHO has approved as safe for house spraying, the most effective is DDT."[16] However, since then, an October 2007 study has linked breast cancer from exposure to DDT prior to puberty.
[17] Poisoning may also occur due to use of DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons by entering the human food chain when animal tissues are affected.
 Symptoms include nervous excitement, tremors, convulsions or death.
  [18] However, DDT use is not always effective, as resistance to DDT was identified in Africa as early as 1955, and by 1972 nineteen species of mosquito worldwide were resistant to DDT.
 [19] A study for the World Health Organization in 2000 from Vietnam established that non-DDT malaria controls were significantly more effective than DDT use.
 [20] The ecological effect of DDT on organisms is an example of bioaccumulation.
  AmountsIn 2006 and 2008,the world used approximately 5.2 billion pounds of pesticides with herbicides constituting the majority of the world pesticide use at 40% followed by insecticides and fungicides with totals of 17% and 10% respectively.[21] The U.S.
 in 2006 and 2007, used approximately 1.1 billion pounds of pesticides accounting for 22% of the world total.[21] For conventional pesticides which are used in the agricultural sector as well in industry, commercial, governmental and the home & garden sectors, the U.S.
 used at total of 857 million pounds, with the agricultural sector accounting for 80% of the conventional pesticide use total.
 [21] Pesticides are also found in majority of U.S.
 households with 78 million out of the 105.5 million households indicating that they use some form of pesticide.
[21] Currently,there are more than 1,055 active ingredients registered as pesticides,[22] which are put together to produce over 16,000 pesticide products that are being marketed in the United States [23] [23]
  CostsOn the cost side of pesticide use there can be a cost to the environment and human health, as well as the cost of the development and research of new pesticides.
  Health effects effects
 A sign warning about potential pesticide exposure.Main articles:
 Health effects of pesticides and Pesticide poisoning poisoning
 Pesticides may cause acute and delayed health effects in those who are exposed.
[24] Pesticide exposure can cause a variety of adverse health effects.
 These effects can range from simple irritation of the skin and eyes to more severe effects such as affecting the nervous system, mimicking hormones causing reproductive problems, and also causing cancer.
[25] A 2007 systematic review found that "most studies on non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia showed positive associations with pesticide exposure" and thus concluded that cosmetic use of pesticides should be decreased.
[26] Strong evidence also exists for other negative outcomes from pesticide exposure including neurological, birth defects, fetal death,[27] and neurodevelopmental disorder.[28] disorder.[28]
 The American Medical Association recommends limiting exposure to pesticides and using safer alternatives:[6] 
"Particular uncertainty exists regarding the long-term effects of low-dose pesticide exposures.
 Current surveillance systems are inadequate to characterize potential exposure problems related either to pesticide usage or pesticide-related illnesses�Considering these data gaps, it is prudent�to limit pesticide exposures�and to use the least toxic chemical pesticide or non-chemical alternative." alternative."
 The World Health Organization and the UN Environment Programme estimate that each year, 3 million workers in agriculture in the developing world experience severe poisoning from pesticides, about 18,000 of whom die.
[18] According to one study, as many as 25 million workers in developing countries may suffer mild pesticide poisoning yearly.
[29] yearly.[29]
 One study found pesticide self-poisoning the method of choice in one third of suicides worldwide, and recommended, among other things, more restrictions on the types of pesticides that are most harmful to humans.[30] humans.[30]
  Environmental effectMain article:
 Environmental effects of pesticides pesticides
 Pesticide use raises a number of environmental concerns.
 Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including non-target species, air, water and soil.[18] Pesticide drift occurs when pesticides suspended in the air as particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them.
 Pesticides are one of the causes of water pollution, and some pesticides are persistent organic pollutants and contribute to soil contamination.
 In addition, pesticide use reduces biodiversity, reduces nitrogen fixation,[31] contributes to pollinator decline,[32][33][34][35] destroys habitat (especially for birds),[36] and threatens endangered species.[18] species.[18]
 Pests can develop a resistance to the pesticide (pesticide resistance), necessitating a new pesticide.
 Alternatively a greater dose of the pesticide can be used to counteract the resistance, although this will cause a worsening of the ambient pollution problem.
  EconomicsHarm Annual US Cost Cost
 Public Health $1.1 billion billion
 Pesticide Resistance in Pest $1.5 billion billion
 Crop Losses Caused by Pesticides $1.4 billion billion
 Bird Losses due to Pesticides $2.2 billion billion

 Human health and environmental cost from pesticides in the United States is a total of $9.6 billion:[37] billion:[37]
 Additional cost includes the registration process and the cost of purchase pesticides.
 The registration process can take several years to complete the 70 different types of field test and can cost between $50�70 million for a single pesticide.[37] Annually the United States spends $10 billion on pesticides.[37] pesticides.[37]
  BenefitsThere are two levels of benefits for pesticide use, primary and secondary.

  MonetaryFor every dollar ($1) that is spent on pesticides for crops yields four dollars ($4) in crops saved.
[39] This means based on the amount of money spent per year on pesticides, $10 billion, that there is an additional $40 billion savings in crop that would be lost due to damage by insects and weeds.
 Generally speaking, farmers benefit from having an increase crop yield and from being able to grow a variety of crops throughout the year.
 Consumers of agricultural products also benefit from being able to afford the vast quantities of produce available year round.
[38] The general public also benefits from the use of pesticides for the control of insect-borne diseases and illnesses, such as malaria.
[38] The use of pesticides creates a large job market, which provides jobs for all of the people who work within the industry.
  AlternativesAlternatives to pesticides are available and include methods of cultivation, use of biological pest controls (such as pheromones and microbial pesticides), genetic engineering, and methods of interfering with insect breeding.
[18] Application of composted yard waste has also been used as a way of controlling pests.[40] These methods are becoming increasingly popular and often are safer than traditional chemical pesticides.
 In addition, EPA is registering reduced-risk conventional pesticides in increasing numbers.
 Cultivation practices include polyculture (growing multiple types of plants), crop rotation, planting crops in areas where the pests that damage them do not live, timing planting according to when pests will be least problematic, and use of trap crops that attract pests away from the real crop.
[18] In the U.S., farmers have had success controlling insects by spraying with hot water at a cost that is about the same as pesticide spraying.[18] spraying.[18]
 Release of other organisms that fight the pest is another example of an alternative to pesticide use.
 These organisms can include natural predators or parasites of the pests.[18] Biological pesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses cause disease in the pest species can also be used.[18] used.[18]
 Interfering with insects' reproduction can be accomplished by sterilizing males of the target species and releasing them, so that they mate with females but do not produce offspring.[18] This technique was first used on the screwworm fly in 1958 and has since been used with the medfly, the tsetse fly,[41] and the gypsy moth.[42] However, this can be a costly, time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.
 Another alternative to pesticides is the thermal treatment of soil through steam.
 Soil steaming kills pest and increases soil health. needed]
 In India, traditional pest control methods include using Panchakavya, the "mixture of five products." The method has recently experienced a resurgence in popularity due in part to use by the organic farming community. needed]
  Push pull strategyThe term "push-pull" was established in 1987 as an approach for integrated pest management (IPM).
 This strategy uses a mixture of behavior-modifying stimuli to manipulate the distribution and abundance of insects.
 "Push" means the insects are repelled or deterred away from whatever resource that is being protected.
 "Pull" means that certain stimuli (semiochemical stimuli, pheromones, food additives, visual stimuli, genetically altered plants, etc.) are used to attract pests to trap crops where they will be killed [43] There are numerous different components involved in order to implement a Push-Pull Strategy in IPM.
 Many case studies testing the effectiveness of the push-pull approach have been done across the world.
 The most successful push-pull strategy was developed in Africa for subsistence farming.
 Another successful case study was performed on the control of Helicoverpa in cotton crops in Australia.
 In Europe, the Middle East, and the United States, push-pull strategies were successfully used in the controlling of Sitona lineatus in bean fields.[43] Plus many more cases where this strategy was more beneficial than simply using pesticides on their crops.
 Some advantages of using the push-pull method are less use of chemical or biological materials and better protection against insect habituation to this control method.
 Some disadvantages of the push-pull strategy is that if there is a lack of appropriate knowledge of behavioral and chemical ecology of the host-pest interactions then this method becomes unreliable.
 Furthermore, because the push-pull method is not a very popular method of IPM operational and registration costs are higher.[44] higher.[44]
 (See:
 Push�pull technology.) technology.)
  EffectivenessSome evidence shows that alternatives to pesticides can be equally effective as the use of chemicals.
 For example, Sweden has halved its use of pesticides with hardly any reduction in crops.
[18] In Indonesia, farmers have reduced pesticide use on rice fields by 65% and experienced a 15% crop increase.
[18] A study of Maize yields in northern Florida found that the application of composted yard waste with high carbon to nitrogen ratio to agricultural fields was highly effective at reducing the population of plant-parasitic nematodes and increasing crop yield, with yield increases ranging from 10% to 212%; the observed effects were long-term, often not appearing until the third season of the study.
 However, pesticide resistance is increasing.
 In the 1940s, U.S.
 farmers lost only 7% of their crops to pests.
 Since the 1980s, loss has increased to 13%, even though more pesticides are being used.
 Between 500 and 1,000 insect and weed species have developed pesticide resistance since 1945.[45] 1945.[45]
  Regulation InternationalIn Europe, recent EU legislation has been approved banning the use of highly toxic pesticides including those that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, those that are endocrine-disrupting, and those that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB).
 Measures were approved to improve the general safety of pesticides across all EU member states.
[46] states.[46]
 Though pesticide regulations differ from country to country, pesticides and products on which they were used are traded across international borders.
 To deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries, delegates to a conference of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization adopted an International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for different countries.
[47] The Code was updated in 1998 and 2002.
[48] The FAO claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use.[4] use.[4]
 Three other efforts to improve regulation of international pesticide trade are the United Nations London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade and the United Nations Codex Alimentarius Commission.
 The former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides, while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries.
[49] Both initiatives operate on a voluntary basis.[49] basis.[49]
 Pesticide safety education and pesticide applicator regulation are designed to protect the public from pesticide misuse, but do not eliminate all misuse.
 Reducing the use of pesticides and choosing less toxic pesticides may reduce risks placed on society and the environment from pesticide use.
[12] Integrated pest management, the use of multiple approaches to control pests, is becoming widespread and has been used with success in countries such as Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, the U.S., Australia, and Mexico.
[18] IPM attempts to recognize the more widespread impacts of an action on an ecosystem, so that natural balances are not upset.
[50] New pesticides are being developed, including biological and botanical derivatives and alternatives that are thought to reduce health and environmental risks.
 In addition, applicators are being encouraged to consider alternative controls and adopt methods that reduce the use of chemical pesticides.
 Pesticides can be created that are targeted to a specific pest's life cycle, which can be environmentally more friendly.
[51] For example, potato cyst nematodes emerge from their protective cysts in response to a chemical excreted by potatoes; they feed on the potatoes and damage the crop.
[51] A similar chemical can be applied to fields early, before the potatoes are planted, causing the nematodes to emerge early and starve in the absence of potatoes.
  United StatesMain article:
 Pesticide regulation in the United States States
 Preparation for an application of hazardous pesticide in USA.In most countries, pesticides must be approved for sale and use by a government agency.
[47] In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for regulating pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA).
[52] Complex and costly studies must be conducted to indicate whether the material is safe to use and effective against the intended pest.
 The EPA regulates pesticides to ensure that these products do not pose adverse effects to humans or the environment.
 Pesticides produced before November 1984 continue to be reassessed in order to meet the current scientific and regulatory standards.
 All registered pesticides are reviewed every 15 years to ensure they meet the proper standards.[52] During the registration process, a label is created.
 The label contains directions for proper use of the material.
 Based on acute toxicity, pesticides are assigned to a Toxicity Class.
 Some pesticides are considered too hazardous for sale to the general public and are designated restricted use pesticides.
 Only certified applicators, who have passed an exam, may purchase or supervise the application of restricted use pesticides.
[47] Records of sales and use are required to be maintained and may be audited by government agencies charged with the enforcement of pesticide regulations. needed]
 The EPA regulates pesticides under two under main acts, both of which were amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996.
 In addition to the EPA, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set standards for the level of pesticide residue that is allowed on or in crops 
The EPA looks at what the potential human health and environmental effects might be associated with the use of the pesticide.[54] pesticide.[54]
 Additionally, the U.S.
 EPA uses the National Research Council's four-step process for human health risk assessment:
 (1) Hazard Identification, (2) Dose-Response Assessment, (3) Exposure Assessment, and (4) Risk Characterization.[55] Characterization.[55]
  HistorySince before 2000 BC, humans have utilized pesticides to protect their crops.
 The first known pesticide was elemental sulfur dusting used in ancient Sumer about 4,500 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia.
 By the 15th century, toxic chemicals such as arsenic, mercury and lead were being applied to crops to kill pests.
 In the 17th century, nicotine sulfate was extracted from tobacco leaves for use as an insecticide.
 The 19th century saw the introduction of two more natural pesticides, pyrethrum, which is derived from chrysanthemums, and rotenone, which is derived from the roots of tropical vegetables.
[56] Until the 1950s, arsenic-based pesticides were dominant.[57] Paul M�ller discovered that DDT was a very effective insecticide.
 Organochlorines such as DDT were dominant, but they were replaced in the U.S.
 by organophosphates and carbamates by 1975.
 Since then, pyrethrin compounds have become the dominant insecticide.[57] Herbicides became common in the 1960s, led by "triazine and other nitrogen-based compounds, carboxylic acids such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and glyphosate".
 The first legislation providing federal authority for regulating pesticides was enacted in 1910;[58] however, decades later during the 1940s manufacturers began to produce large amounts of synthetic pesticides and their use became widespread.
Some sources consider the 1940s and 1950s to have been the start of the "pesticide era."
 Environmental Protection Agency was established in 1970 and amendments to the pesticide law in 1972,[60] pesticide use has increased 50-fold since 1950 and 2.3 million tonnes (2.5 million short tons) of industrial pesticides are now used each year.
[56] Seventy-five percent of all pesticides in the world are used in developed countries, but use in developing countries is increasing.
[18] In 2001 the EPA stopped reporting yearly pesticide use statistics.
 A study of USA pesticide use trends through 1997 was published in 2003 by the National Science Foundation's Center for Integrated Pest Management.
 In the 1960s, it was discovered that DDT was preventing many fish-eating birds from reproducing, which was a serious threat to biodiversity.
 Rachel Carson wrote the best-selling book Silent Spring about biological magnification.
 The agricultural use of DDT is now banned under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, but it is still used in some developing nations to prevent malaria and other tropical diseases by spraying on interior walls to kill or repel mosquitoes.
 Types of PesticidesPesticides are often referred to according to the type of pest they control.
 Another way to think about pesticides is to consider those that are chemical pesticides or are derived from a common source or production method.
 Other categories include biopesticides, antimicrobials, and pest control devices.
 Chemical Pesticides Pesticides
 Some examples of chemically-related pesticides follow.
 Other examples are available in sources such as Recognition and Management of Pesticide Poisonings.
 Organophosphate Pesticides - These pesticides affect the nervous system by disrupting the enzyme that regulates acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter.
 Most organophosphates are insecticides.
 They were developed during the early 19th century, but their effects on insects, which are similar to their effects on humans, were discovered in 1932.
 Some are very poisonous (they were used in World War II as nerve agents).
 However, they usually are not persistent in the environment.
 Carbamate Pesticides affect the nervous system by disupting an enzyme that regulates acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter.
 The enzyme effects are usually reversible.
 There are several subgroups within the carbamates.
 Organochlorine Insecticides were commonly used in the past, but many have been removed from the market due to their health and environmental effects and their persistence (e.g.
 DDT and chlordane).
 Pyrethroid Pesticides were developed as a synthetic version of the naturally occurring pesticide pyrethrin, which is found in chrysanthemums.
 They have been modified to increase their stability in the environment.
 Some synthetic pyrethroids are toxic to the nervous system.
 Biopesticides Biopesticides
 Biopesticides are certain types of pesticides derived from such natural materials as animals, plants, bacteria, and certain minerals.
 For example, canola oil and baking soda have pesticidal applications and are considered biopesticides.
 At the end of 2001, there were approximately 195 registered biopesticide active ingredients and 780 products.
 Biopesticides fall into three major classes:
 (1) Microbial pesticides consist of a microorganism (e.g., a bacterium, fungus, virus or protozoan) as the active ingredient.
 Microbial pesticides can control many different kinds of pests, although each separate active ingredient is relatively specific for its target pest[s].
 For example, there are fungi that control certain weeds, and other fungi that kill specific insects.
 The most widely used microbial pesticides are subspecies and strains of Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt.
 Each strain of this bacterium produces a different mix of proteins, and specifically kills one or a few related species of insect larvae.
 While some Bt's control moth larvae found on plants, other Bt's are specific for larvae of flies and mosquitoes.
 The target insect species are determined by whether the particular Bt produces a protein that can bind to a larval gut receptor, thereby causing the insect larvae to starve starve
 (2) Plant-Incorporated-Protectants (PIPs) are pesticidal substances that plants produce from genetic material that has been added to the plant.
 For example, scientists can take the gene for the Bt pesticidal protein, and introduce the gene into the plant's own genetic material.
 Then the plant, instead of the Bt bacterium, manufactures the substance that destroys the pest.
 The protein and its genetic material, but not the plant itself, are regulated by EPA.
 (3) Biochemical pesticides are naturally occurring substances that control pests by non-toxic mechanisms.
 Conventional pesticides, by contrast, are generally synthetic materials that directly kill or inactivate the pest.
 Biochemical pesticides include chemicals, such as insect sex pheromones, that interfere with mating, as well as various scented plant extracts that attract insect pests to traps.
 Because it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a substance meets the criteria for classification as a biochemical pesticide, EPA has established a special committee to make such decisions.

 Desiccants Desiccants
 Promote drying of living tissues, such as unwanted plant tops.
 Insect growth regulators regulators
 Disrupt the molting, maturity from pupal stage to adult, or other life processes of insects.
 Plant growth regulators regulators
 Substances (excluding fertilizers or other plant nutrients) that alter the expected growth, flowering, or reproduction rate of plants.
 Pest Control Devices Devices
 What about pest control devices?
 EPA also has a role in regulating devices used to control pests.
 More specifically, a "device" is any instrument or contrivance (other than a firearm) intended for trapping, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest.
 A mousetrap is an example of a device.
 Unlike pesticides, EPA does not require devices to be registered with the Agency.
 Devices are subject to certain labeling, packaging, record keeping, and import/export requirements, however.
 For more information on devices, see Pest Control Devices.

 Pesticide chemical labels contain important information about how to safely use products in accordance with legal requirements.
 The APVMA has developed educational materials that can be printed and displayed or used in chemical training courses to help chemical users identify and understand the warnings and instructions on pesticide chemical labels.
 These documents can be printed for use in the home, workplace and in chemical training courses.
 The OECD Pesticide Registration and Re-registration Project helps governments work together to assess chemical pesticide risks to man and the environment.
 The assessment of risks is important because it provides the basis for governments' decisions whether to approve, or "register," new chemical pesticides and whether to renew the registration of old ones.
 By working together, governments can evaluate a chemical pesticide's risks more quickly and thoroughly.
 This speeds up the process of approving safer new pesticides and stopping use of riskier ones.
 The initial driving force for this work was a workshop held in 1992 (Washington) that developed a number of recommendations for future activities and concluded that a primary goal for OECD should be the sharing of national review reports.
 This was followed by a pilot project to compare country reviews of seven pesticides to determine the extent to which countries might share the burden of pesticide data review by using each other�s data review reports.
 Based on this work, and a subsequent workshop held in 1994 (Bilthoven) that recommended the establishment of a mechanism for ad hoc exchange of reports (i.e.
 development of harmonized structures and content for data submissions and data review reports), the Pesticide Programme has focused on:
 harmonizing industry reporting and government review formats formats
 building a database of government review schedules to help governments identify and use each other's chemical pesticide assessment reports; reports;
 identifying and describing government registration requirements and approaches; and and
 harmonizing hazard/risk assessment approaches and test guidelines.

 The OECD has agreed guidance concerning two formats to be used throughout member countries:
 one for industry to use when making data submission (dossiers) (dossiers)
 one for governments to use when writing their evaluation reports (monographs) (monographs)
 The formats do not require OECD countries to make the same regulatory decisions.
 Rather their purpose is to facilitate registration by minimizing duplication of effort for both industry and governments.
 The Guidance for Industry Data Submissions and Guidance for Government Data Reviews, revised in March 2001, are designed to promote quality and consistency in the "dossiers" of data submitted by chemical pesticide producers when applying for a new registration, and the government "monographs" that review the data.
 Both sets of guidance specify the format to follow and level of information to include.
 The OECD guidance helps to ensure that dossiers and monographs are clear and complete, and that information is easy to find.
 This makes it easier for governments to use each other's pesticide risk evaluations.
 And it enables pesticide registrants (usually producers) to submit the same dossiers to different governments.The two guidance documents were developed over several years, drawing on chemical pesticide reviews previously written by individual OECD countries.
 In the past, pesticide data submissions and reviews were written in many different ways.
 Database of Government Review Schedules for Biocides and Pesticides Pesticides
 This database lists thousands of past and current schedules for OECD government reviews of active ingredients in agricultural pesticides and non-agricultural pesticides or biocides, such as household insecticides, paint preservatives and disinfectants.
 With such information, a government planning a review can identify if other governments have also reviewed a substance, or will review it, which facilitates the sharing of assessment reports.
 These reports, called �monographs�, contain a written record of the government�s evaluation of a biocide�s or pesticide�s risks based on the data provided in the application for registration.
 Governments can use monographs written by others to supplement or even replace an independent review of the pesticide.
 The database does not contain the monographs themselves but rather functions as a pointer system, enabling users to determine which governments have assessed which pesticides or biocides and can be contacted to get a copy of the monographs.
 The database has helped OECD governments to identify and exchange hundreds of pesticide monographs in recent years.
 This exchange has enabled governments to strengthen and broaden their national pesticide reviews, by including perspectives and information from other countries.
 Government registration requirements and approaches approaches
 Data Requirements Requirements
 Data requirements are the data pesticide producers must provide when seeking to register a new pesticide.
 These data are intended to show a pesticide's intrinsic properties, potential hazards to man and the environment, and the likelihood of exposure.
 The data also show how the pesticide will be used, how effective it is in controlling the target pest (be this an insect, disease, or weed), and the "mode of action" or means by which it kills or controls the pest.
 The data are submitted to governments, which use them to assess the pesticide's risks and benefits, and to decide whether or not to approve the registration.
 Harmonising data requirements throughout the OECD is important because it makes it easier for governments to work together in evaluating pesticide risks.
 As determined in a survey published in 1994 - Data Requirements for Pesticide Registration in OECD Member Countries:
 Survey Results - data requirements for the registration of chemical pesticides are largely harmonised within the OECD.
 The survey showed that most OECD governments require the same or similar data on pesticide:
 identity (of the active ingredient as well as any inert ingredients in the pesticide product formulation) formulation)
 physical-chemical properties properties
 function, mode of action and handling handling
 manufacturing, quality control and analytical methods (to detect residues in food or water) water)
 residues (the quantity and characteristics of residues likely to occur in food) food)
 efficacy (in controlling the target pest) pest)
 toxicity (to man) man)
 ecotoxicity (to wildlife and beneficial insects) insects)
 fate and behaviour in the environment.
 Confidential business information information
 The report OECD Governments' Approaches to the Protection of Proprietary Rights and Confidential Business Information in Pesticide Registration (1998) presents the results of a survey conducted to determine OECD governments' policies to protect confidential business information (such as a new pesticide's formula) and the registrants' proprietary rights over these data.
 The survey was done to determine whether government policies would permit an international exchange of pesticide reviews.
 Electronic Tools and Techniques Techniques
 While OECD Member countries and other stakeholders have worked through the separate OECD programmes (new and existing industrial chemicals, agricultural pesticides and biocides) on the development and use of electronic tools for data submission and regulatory purposes, communication among them has been limited.
 Given the similarity of functions performed in the programmes related to data submission and evaluation, monograph production and archiving of dossier documents, a workshop was held to consider opportunities for harmonisation of the electronic tools used.
 The report of the OECD Workshop on Electronic Tools for Data Submission, held in Ottawa, Canada on 2-4 October 2002, documents government approaches and recommendations for OECD work in this area.
 Best Management Practices Practices
 In 1999, OECD conducted a survey of member countries to collect information on best management practices among regulatory agencies.
 The results of this survey document the activities governments carry out in the regulatory decision process as well as any obligations under law, fees charged and time-frames established for the activities; innovative, successful approaches employed in their countries to improve the efficiency of the regulatory process; best practices that have led to the largest gains in efficiency in their countries; and finally, details on specific services for which fees are charged as well as the reasons for charging fees.

 Prenatal exposure to a chemical designed to enhance the effect of household insecticides may harm neurodevelopment, data from a prospective cohort study of children found.
 Data analyzed for almost 350 children found that each unit increase in exposure to piperonyl butoxide -- a chemical mixed with pyrethroid pesticides to improve its efficacy -- was associated with a 1.32-fold increase in the odds of delayed mental development at age 3 years (P=0.01), according to Megan Horton, PhD, of Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health in New York City, and colleagues.
 The most highly exposed children had a more than threefold increased likelihood of slowed mental development (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.38 to 6.98), Horton and co-authors reported online ahead of the March issue of Pediatrics.
 Action Points Points
 �Explain that prenatal exposure to piperonyl butoxide -- a chemical designed to enhance the effect of insecticides -- may harm neurodevelopment.
 �Note that exposure to permethrin, a common household insecticide, was not associated with children's neurodevelopment.
 Although the effects associated with exposure were modest, the researchers wrote, "they were comparable in magnitude to reports from studies of other prenatal neurotoxicants that affect development in young children." children."
 They added, however, that "these findings should be considered preliminary and may be useful for generating future hypotheses." hypotheses."
 The use of residential pesticides has shifted in recent years from organophosphorus insecticides -- which have been associated with impaired neurodevelopment -- to pyrethroid insecticides -- which have not been evaluated extensively for potential developmental toxicity.
 There is concern, however, because pyrethroid insecticides are detoxified in the body by cytochrome P450 enzymes, and piperonyl butoxide inhibits this pathway, "thus delaying the detoxification of active pyrethroid parent compounds," according to background provided by the researchers.
 Exposure to piperonyl butoxide has also been shown to generate reactive oxygen species, lending support to the possibility that oxidative damage could be a mechanism for altered neurologic development.
 In the current study, Horton and her colleagues assessed exposure to piperonyl butoxide in personal air collected during the pregnancies of 348 black and Dominican mothers and to the common pyrethroid pesticide, permethrin, in personal air and maternal and umbilical cord plasma.
 The mothers, from low-income neighborhoods in New York City, were participating in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) Mothers and Newborns cohort.
 The researchers assessed the cognitive and motor development of the offspring at age 3 years using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.
 After adjustment for gender, gestational age, ethnicity, maternal education, maternal intelligence, quality of the home caretaking environment, and prenatal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, children with high prenatal exposure to piperonyl butoxide (greater than 4.34 ng/m3) scored 3.9 points lower on the mental development index of the instrument (P=0.04).
 There was no association between exposure and the psychomotor development index.
 "This finding is worrisome because mental development index scores are more predictive of school readiness," Horton and her colleagues wrote.
 Prenatal exposure to permethrin -- measured either in personal air or plasma -- was not associated with either mental or psychomotor development.
 The authors noted, however, that permethrin is rapidly metabolized, complicating its detection.
 Horton and her team acknowledged that their study was limited by possible residual confounding from unmeasured factors and by the lack of measurement of piperonyl butoxide exposure in blood or urine samples.
 The study was supported by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Environmental Protection Agency, Educational Foundation of America, John and Wendy Neu Family Foundation, New York Community Trust, and Trustees of the Blanchette Hooker Rockefeller Fund.
 The authors reported that they had no conflicts of interest.

 Pesticide Chemical Safety Safety
 This section discusses agricultural chemical safety for pesticides, including rodenticides, insecticides, herbicides, etc.
 Pesticides are chemicals that protect crops and livestock from rodents, insects, disease, or weeds.
 They also control pests that endanger human health.
 Because esticides are poisonous, they can be extremely dangerous to humans.
 Before applying commercial pesticides, always ensure your safety, the safety of others, and the safety of the environment.
 There are several government agencies that govern the use of commercial pesticides.
 For more information on pesticide usage, contact one or more of the following groups:
 Texas Department of Agriculture, Texas Department of Health, Structural Pest Control Board, Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 General Pesticide Safety Safety
 The following sections provide general or specific guidelines for handling pesticides.
 To help reduce the hazards associated with pesticides:
 Do not transport, mix, or use agricultural chemicals unless you can summon help, if needed.
 Keep an ample supply of water nearby to flush exposed areas, if a spill occurs.
 Check all pesticide equipment before you use it to ensure proper working condition.
 Read pesticide labels carefully.
 Follow the label directions when mixing, applying, storing, or disposing of pesticides.
 Wear personal protective equipment to prevent dermal, inhalation, and mucous membrane exposure.
 Do not eat, drink, or smoke when handling pesticides.
 Launder clothing and bathe after working with pesticides to ensure that all chemicals are removed from clothing and skin.
 Do not use agricultural pesticides around the home or office.
 Observe assigned reentry intervals.
 Always wear the appropriate protective clothing when entering fields before the reentry date.
 Always handle pesticides downhill from wells, cisterns, sink holes, ditches, or standing water.
 Do not apply pesticides when rain is imminent or if wind could affect the spraying area.
 Triple-rinse spray equipment and empty containers.
 Apply the rinse water to the treated field.
 Properly dispose of empty containers.
 Page 13-2 13-2
 Preparing to Apply Pesticides Pesticides
 Preparation is essential for chemical safety.
 Follow these steps to properly prepare for pesticide application:
 1.
 Plan Ahead.
 Always read chemical labels before attempting to work with pesticides.
 Prepare for a possible emergency by maintaining a personal decontamination site, a chemical spill kit, and by knowing the proper first aid procedures associated with your pesticide.
 2.
 Move Pesticides Safely.
 Careless chemical transportation can cause spills and contamination.
 Do not carry pesticides in an enclosed area, such as a car.
 Be sure to secure the pesticides to prevent shifting or bouncing.
 In addition, never leave your vehicle unattended when transporting chemicals.
 3.
 Select Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment.
 Regardless of the pesticide's toxicity, always wear a long-sleeve shirt and pants when working with pesticides.
 Wear additional protective equipment, as necessary.
 4.
 Select Application Equipment.
 Choose suitable equipment to properly apply pesticides.
 Before using the equipment, inspect it for good working order.
 5.
 Provide Prior Notification.
 Before applying pesticides, inform all people in or around the application area.
 Notification allows people to protect themselves from harmful chemicals.
 Mixing Pesticides Pesticides
 Always read and carefully follow label directions when mixing pesticides.
 Even if you are familiar with a particular chemical, reread the label to ensure that you have the latest safety information.
 In addition, follow these guidelines for mixing pesticides:
 1.
 Wear Personal Protective Equipment.
 Always wear protective gear when handling hazardous chemicals.
 2.
 Work in a Safe Area.
 Page 13-3 13-3
 The pesticide mixing and loading area should be well ventilated, well lighted, and downhill from any water sources.
 Concrete slabs are ideal for mixing chemicals since they allow for easy cleanup.
 3.
 Measure Chemicals Correctly.
 Measure and mix pesticides carefully.
 Never mix different pesticides except as directed by the label or chemical manufacturer.
 Do not use more chemical than prescribed by the pesticide label.
 The overuse of pesticides is illegal, and may result in the following:
 Higher pest control costs costs
 Pesticide residue in food food
 Groundwater pollution pollution
 Pesticide resistance resistance
 4.
 Pour Pesticides Carefully.
 Always wear a face shield and take care not to splash chemicals when pouring pesticides.
 Never use your mouth to siphon pesticides.
 Applying Pesticides Pesticides
 When you apply pesticides, you are responsible for protecting yourself, other people, and the environment.
 Follow these guidelines when applying pesticides:
 1.
 Minimize Exposure.
 Even mildly toxic chemicals can harm you if you use them daily.
 Take care to minimize your exposure to any chemical.
 Avoid working in pesticide spray, mist, or runoff.
 Always work with another person when working with hazardous chemicals.
 2.
 Avoid Applying Pesticides in Sensitive Areas.
 Avoid spraying pesticides near beehives or areas that humans normally occupy (e.g., schools, playgrounds, hospitals, etc.).
 If you must apply pesticides in sensitive areas, do so when the weather is calm and when people are not around.
 3.
 Avoid Pesticide Drift, Runoff, and Spills.
 Pesticides that fall outside the targeted application area can be very hazardous.
 Choose weather conditions, equipment, and chemicals that do not lend themselves to these hazards.
 4.
 Avoid Equipment Accidents.
 Page 13-4 13-4
 Equipment accidents are often caused by poor maintenance and improper work habits.
 Avoid equipment accidents by following all operating instructions.
 Pesticide Storage and Disposal Disposal
 Always try to use all the pesticide in your application tank.
 If pesticides remain, use them on other target locations.
 After emptying the tank, clean and store the equipment.
 The following summary of EPA storage criteria should be followed for pesticides labelled with the signal words DANGER, POISON, or WARNING, or the skull and crossbones symbol.
 These procedures and criteria are not necessary for the storage of pesticides classed as less toxic (CAUTION word on the label) or for those registered for use in the home or garden.
 Site Storage:
 Locate where flooding is unlikely.
 Locate where runoff will not contaminate any water system.
 Storage Facility:
 Dry, well ventilated, separate room, building, or covered area with fire protection (e.g., dry chemical fire extinguisher).
 Secured by fence and/or locked doors.
 Signs on rooms/buildings to provide hazard warning (e.g., DANGER, POISON, PESTICIDE STORAGE).
 Movable pesticide equipment is labeled as contaminated and not removed from the site until decontaminated.
 Provision is available for the decontamination of personnel and equipment; contaminated water disposed of as excess pesticide; contaminated runoff collected and treated as excess pesticide.
 Operational Procedures:
 Store pesticide containers in rows with the labels plainly visible.
 Place contents from damaged containers in sound containers.
 If relevant, segregate pesticides by formulation.
 Store rigid containers in an upright position, with tight lids/bungs, off the ground, in a manner to permit access and inspection.
 Maintain a complete inventory indicating the number and identity of containers.
 Check containers regularly for corrosion and leaks.
 Keep suitable absorbent (e.g., vermiculite) on hand in case of spills.
 Safety Precautions:
 Inspect pesticide containers for leaks before handling them.
 Page 13-5 13-5
 Do not allow unauthorized personnel in the storage area.
 Do not store pesticides next to items intended for consumption by animals or humans.
 Do not eat, drink, smoke, or chew tobacco where pesticides are present.
 Do not store beverages, food, eating utensils, or smoking material in the storage or loading areas.
 Wear rubber gloves while handling containers of pesticides.
 Wash hands immediately after handling pesticides.
 Remove contaminated protective clothing immediately; extra sets of clean clothing should be nearby.
 Fire Control:
 Where large quantities are stored, inform the fire department.
 Furnish the fire chief with home telephone numbers of responsible persons.
 Disposal:
 Unused or outdated pesticides must be disposed as hazardous chemicals.
 See the Hazardous Waste Disposal chapter, Laboratory Safety Manual for more information.
 IMPORTANT:
 Never leave pesticide containers at a field site.
 Be sure to account for every container used, and safely dispose of empty containers.
 NOTE:
 Store herbicides separately from other pesticides.
 Some herbicides may volatilize and contaminate the pesticides.
 Pesticide Cleanup Cleanup
 Always thoroughly clean all pesticide equipment as soon as you are through with it.
 Leaving pesticide residue in mixing, loading, or application equipment can result in accidental injury or death to livestock or people or unwanted contamination of plants or soil.
 Clean the inside and outside of pesticide equipment, including nozzles.
 Dispose of contaminated rinse water as directed on the chemical label.
 IMPORTANT:
 Do not allow pesticide rinse water to contaminate water supplies.
 Antidotes Antidotes
 Time is of the essence when pesticide overexposure occurs.
 However, using an antidote kit may not be the best course of action.
 Unless a physician has stated that an antidote is needed, it should not be administered.
 Some antidotes such as atropine can be poisonous if misused.
 A prescription may even be necessary to acquire the antidote.
 You may be able to get a local physician to write the prescription, prepare a written protocol regarding the use of the antidote, and train pertinent Page 13-6 employees about how and when to administer the antidote.
 If medical assistance is available locally through a hospital, physician, or ambulance service, you should call 911 (or 9-911, from a campus phone) and call the University Police Department (3003).

 Beyond Pesticides, November 28, 2011) The U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released Pesticide Chemical Search, a new database that allows users to easily access information related to pesticide active ingredients, including regulatory and scientific information.
 Pesticide Chemical Search is designed to consolidate information from the Office of Pesticide Program�s website and several other important sources.
 Though the database makes searching for pesticide information more user-friendly, it does not offer additional information on chemical adverse effects.
 The new application collects existing web pages on specific chemicals on EPA�s Office of Pesticide Program�s website and allows users access to this information through a single portal.
 Users will also be able to quickly find the current status of a chemical and where it is in the review process.
 Another key feature is the ability to determine if there are any dockets open for public comment for a given chemical.
 Other key features of Pesticide Chemical search include:
 � 20,000+ regulatory documents such as fact sheets and REDs REDs
 � Links to over 800 dockets in Regulations.gov Regulations.gov
 � Links to important information, including pesticide tolerances in the eCFR eCFR
 � Web services that provide a wide variety and depth of information about a particular chemical chemical
 � 100,000+ chemical synonyms to power the search engine engine
 Pesticide Chemical Search will be expanded to include pesticide product labels and other relevant information in the near future.
 The new Pesticide Chemical Search tool can be found at www.epa.gov/pesticides/chemicalsearch.
 Home Pesticide Chemical Safety Safety
 Bryce Carleton Carleton
 The label is the law:
 Everything you need to know is in there.
 When you last applied pesticides, did you read the label fully?
 I�ll wager you didn�t.
 When it comes to applying home pesticides, the industry has gone to great efforts to determine proper safety margins in the application of home pesticides.
 You often may be provided with a pre-measured dosing bottle, and small measuring cup, or tablespoon measuring device to properly measure your chemicals for home use.
 Ask yourself:
 Did you read the label last time you applied your chemical?
 Did you measure the dose properly when you applied it?
 Did you even identify the correct pest and apply the proper chemical in the first place?
 If you didn�t do all of the above properly, congratulations�you have just assumed all liability in the case any detrimental effects occur.
 The last thing you want to do is make the neighbor kids or your dog sick.
 It is for these reasons, that you should completely and fully read the label EVERY time you purchase and plan to use a lawn or garden chemical.
 What do you do first?
 Identify the proper pest.
 First and foremost, before any chemical is applied, you must accurately diagnose the problem you are having with your lawn or garden.
 Wouldn�t you feel silly applying an insecticide to your yard for a brown patch which you thought was chinch bugs, only to later find out it didn�t work, and what you really had was a fungal disease?
 You have just unnecessarily exposed your family and pets to an unwarranted dose of chemicals.
 But there are so many! How do I know which one will work?
 To be honest, go back and read the above paragraph again.
 Identifying your pest is paramount to choosing a chemical.
 I recommend using a targeted approach, rather than a broad-spectrum approach.
 By targeted, I mean to say that you should select the best chemical match to the insect or disease that you are trying to eradicate.
 In other words, if you are trying for instance, to kill mole crickets, look for a product that affects the least non-target insects as possible.
 If you are not having problems with scorpions, snakes, or spiders, why would you put out such a wide ranging pesticide?
 A bit of overkill, wouldn�t you agree?
 Note that in many ways, many of these other critters are nature�s own insect control devices.
 Do your homework:
 Find the safest, most effective solution.
 Okay great! Now you�ve identified the nasty little vermin that is attacking your prized squash plant.
 Now what?
 Are you the kind that jumps immediately to the thought �Well this chemical killed my lawn insect, I wonder if it will work on my squash plant?� Well hold on there just a minute.
 Don�t go in with all hoses blasting lawn chemical all over your garden vegetables.
 And vice versa, don�t try to treat your lawn with a garden chemical.
 Why?
 Simple:
 Not all chemicals are created equally.
 Whoa.
 Think about it.
 There may be little no-see-ums that your fancy bottle of chemical doesn�t even affect.
 Were you aware that there are very few general use pesticides which are labeled for treatment of fire ants in gardens?
 The last thing you want to use around vegetables you eat is a fipronyl-loaded chemical or Orthene.
 These are nasty and you don�t dare use them around food crops.
 Tip:
 Look for a safer alternative such as one containing either Spinosad or diatomaceous earth.
 Pick your poison:
 Liquid or granular, and how do you decide?
 Many people get confused in selecting the proper pesticide.
 Remember, that it makes no difference whether you choose liquid or granular, so long as you measure and dose properly.
 For proper measurements, you must first measure the area of your yard, and determine your cubic yards or square feet (depending on how your label dictates).
 Next you must properly set your output equipment to match the desired rate.
 All rate settings should be easily marked on your device, and the setting should not vibrate, move, or jitter out of place.
 Deciding which chemical to use is a bit trickier.
 Is brand �X� better than brand �Y�?
 Here�s where you must do your due diligence.
 A little internet homework can definitely help you in the final decision.
 Follow through.
 Use the least amount necessary, as the label indicates.
 Easy right?
 Use exactly what the label recommends.
 No more, no less.
 When chemical runoff or chemical drift affects a non-target pest, it can have unintended consequences.
 Measure your doses to address the target with the least amount of chemical necessary.
 Your neighbors will thank you for not destroying their prized monarch butterfly breeding program.
 Are there any concerns that I should be aware of from the City�s standpoint?
 As a matter of fact, yes, there are several.
 The City would like to remind you that it is a violation of the law for any chemical overspray to go down storm sewer drains.
 Residents must be diligent to not over-treat their yard to the point that runoff during a rain event reaches the storm sewers.
 Another related issue is over-treating into your neighbor�s yard or onto the public sidewalks or streets.
 Both of these types of over-treatment can potentially cause runoff that enters the City�s storm water drains.
 We therefore ask that you be diligent in properly applying all chemicals, and to please stay off of sidewalks, streets, and neighbors� yards with these applications.
 Last resort?
 Call a professional.
 In the end, it is all about restoring your comfort and convenience when outdoors.
 Why would you run the risk of making a mistake putting out something you aren�t certain of?
 When in doubt, call a professional applicator.
 These folks are trained and tested to properly identify and treat pests of all types.
 And you can bet they won�t confuse brown patch with chinch bugs.
 Pesticide Application Safety Tips Tips
 Pesticides can enter your body through several points:
 ingestion, absorption, or injection.
 Many homeowners inadvertently expose their family by the absorption method when they treat their own lawn.
 For this reason, when you absolutely, positively have to do it yourself, follow these simple safety tips when applying pesticides yourself:

 Pesticides are chemicals used to eliminate or control a variety of agricultural pests that can damage crops and livestock and reduce farm productivity.
 The most commonly applied pesticides are insecticides (to kill insects), herbicides (to kill weeds), rodenticides (to kill rodents), and fungicides (to control fungi, mold, and mildew).
 Of these pesticide classes, herbicides (weed killers) are the most widely used.
 Today, over 1 billion tons of pesticides are used in the US every year.1 year.1
 A Brief History History
 Pesticides are not a modern invention.
 Elemental sulfur was used by ancient Sumerians to protect their crops from insects.
 Medieval farmers and scientists experimented with chemicals ranging from arsenic to lead on common crops.
 Nineteenth century research focused on more natural techniques involving compounds made with the roots of tropical vegetables and chrysanthemums.
In 1939, Dichloro-Diphenyl- Trichloroethane, or DDT was discovered to be extremely effective and rapidly became the most widely used insecticide in the world.
 Twenty years later, serious concerns about the human safety and biological impacts of DDT led 86 countries to ban its use.3 use.3
 The invention of DDT coupled with dramatic increases in crop yields in the 1950's kicked off what many call the "pesticide era." 
Today, more than 20,000 pesticides are registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) resulting in a multibillion-dollar industry in the United States alone.4 alone.4
 Pesticide Use on Factory Livestock Farms Farms
 There are numerous chemical pesticides used to control insects and other pests in livestock facilities.
 Industrial farms apply these chemicals directly to the skin, fur and feathers of livestock such as cattle, pigs and poultry in order to kill off flies, mites, spiders, cockroaches, ticks and other pests.5 pests.5
 Even though these problems can be reduced without the use of toxic chemicals, industrial agriculture relies on pesticides to counteract the filthy conditions inside livestock facilities.
 Improved cleanliness inside farm facilities, fly traps and the use of higher quality feed could all help to minimize these problems6 without posing any risks to human, animal or environmental health.
 Pesticides and Animal Feed Feed
 Approximately 37% of the world's grain and 66% of U.S.
 grain is used for livestock feed.7 This grain is grown by intensive farming operations that use massive quantities of pesticides while producing problems such as pesticide resistance in insects and weeds, and pollution of nearby water supplies with toxic chemicals.
 Many grain crops are genetically modified, so that the plants are bred either to contain pesticides within their entire genetic makeup or to withstand direct application of chemical pesticides or herbicides.
 Furthermore, when grain is grown with pesticides and then fed to livestock, pesticide residues accumulate in the animals' fatty tissue.
 When humans eat the meat and dairy products derived from these animals, we're exposed to the toxic ingredients in the pesticides and are at risk of developing health problems as a result.
 However, the most direct route to pesticide exposure is through ingesting produce with pesticide residues.
 Pesticides and Public Health Health
 Pesticides are a public health concern and have been linked to a range of diseases and disorders.
  Regulation of Pesticides Pesticides
 Pesticides are tested and approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which establishes "tolerances," or maximum residue levels, that limit the amount of a given pesticide that can safely remain in or on a food."
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is then responsible for monitoring pesticide levels on fruits and vegetables, while the Department of Agriculture (USDA) is charged with the task of surveying pesticide residues in meat, eggs and dairy products.
 Many believe that the EPA's methods for testing pesticides are insufficient because they only examine the effects of exposure to pesticides at high doses.
 Without conducting research concerning long-term exposure to low doses of pesticides, these studies neglect to base safety levels on real-life situations.
 Moreover, the tests examine the effects of a single chemical, whereas people are typically contaminated with small amounts of hundreds of pesticides at any one time.15 time.15
 The FDA is also criticized for its inadequate monitoring of pesticide levels on fruits and vegetables.
 The Environmental Working Group reports that the FDA fails to test the majority of produce consumed in the US, and as a result Americans regularly consume food-bearing residues of illegal pesticides that are not approved for use in the US.16 US.16

 Pesticides Not to be Confused with Fertilizers Fertilizers
 Modern agriculture production methods can include heaving applications of other chemicals besides pesticides, namely fertilizers.
 There is a wide range of fertilizers used on food and feed crops - from organic compost for diversified crops to petrochemicals used on conventional commodity crops.
 While pesticides are specifically designed to eliminate pests, fungi and weeds, fertilizers are chemical compounds that promote growth and yield.
 Alternatives to Pesticides:
 Integrated Pest Management Management
 Many sustainable farms rely upon Integrated Pest Management (IPM) as an alternative to the heavy use of pesticides.
 IPM is a growing movement amongst farms of all sizes that incorporates a variety of techniques to eliminate pests while minimizing damage to the environment.
 For instance, an IPM farm will grow pest-resistant crop varieties, use predatory insects to kill plant-eating pests, employ mechanical pest traps, and eliminate nesting areas by plowing under harvested crops.
 Chemical and natural pesticides are used only as a last resort.
 Another technique used by sustainable farmers is crop rotation, which involves planting crops in different places each season in order to replenish nutrients removed from the soil by a particular plant.
 This practice breaks pest cycles and at the same time allows the soil to naturally replenish itself.
 What You Can Do Do
 When you prepare conventional food, there are some measures you can take to reduce your intake of pesticides.
 Be sure to wash your fruits and vegetables thoroughly.
 Peeling your food is also an option that can help reduce the consumption of pesticides.
 For meat and dairy products, it is best to consume those foods that contain less fat, as that is where pesticides typically accumulate in animals.
 Purchase skim milk or low-fat dairy products and remove the fat from cuts of meat before you cook them.
 But the best way to avoid consuming synthetic pesticides along with your food is to eat organic produce, meat and dairy products.
 Organic food is grown and processed without being treated or supplemented with synthetic fertilizers or pesticides, although it can be treated with natural pesticides.
 Look for the USDA certified organic label on your foods.
 And even better than simply looking for organic food, frequent a local farmers' market or farm.
 This way, you can ask the farmer directly about his or her pest control methods.
 Some sustainable farms aren't certified organic, but don't use any pesticides at all.
 The only way to find out is to ask! ask!
 Did You Know?
 A 2004 analysis of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data revealed that 100% of blood and urine tests from subjects they monitored showed pesticide residues.
 Two insecticides � chlorpyrifos and methyl parathion � were found at levels up to 4.6 times greater than what the US government deems acceptable.18 acceptable.18
 In a joint study conducted by scientists from the CDC, the University of Washington and Emory University, researchers found that pesticide levels in test subjects dropped to undetectable levels upon switching to an organic diet.
 When the subjects switched back to a non-organic diet, pesticide residues almost immediately became detectable.19 detectable.19
 According to Cornell entomologist David Pimentel, "It has been estimated that only 0.1% of applied pesticides reach the target pests, leaving the bulk of the pesticides (99.9%) to impact the environment."20 environment."20

 What is a pesticide?
 Definition and composition of a pesticide pesticide
 Usually, a pesticide is a product designed to destroy organisms deemed to be undesirable or noxious.
 End-use products contain one or several active ingredients and formulants.
 Active ingredient:
 constituting a product to which is linked the pesticide�s effect.
 The common name of the active ingredient appears on the label product under the heading �guarantee�.
 Formulant:
 any substance or group of substances other than the active ingredient that is intentionally added to a pest control product to improve its physical characteristics (e.g., sprayability, solubility, spreadability or stability).
 Contrary to active ingredients, formulants which are contained in the composition of an end-use product are not mentioned on the product label.
 Kerosene, ethanol, gelatin and soybean oil are formulants.
 To learn more about these, please consult the List of Formulants used in pesticides in Canada.
 A pesticide is designated by its common name, chemical name or commercial name.
 The common name refers to the active ingredient.
 The chemical name designates the active ingredient chemical structure name.
 The commercial name is the name given by the manufacturer.
 For example, Roundup, a commercially available product, contains formulants and an active ingredient, known under the common name "glyphosate" and under the chemical name "N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine".
 Legal definitions definitions
 In addition to their usual definition, pesticides also have a legal definition.
 These products are designated by two terms:
 "pest control products" according to the legislation at federal level, and "pesticides" at the provincial level.
 At federal level level
 At federal level, the Pest Control Products Act includes the definition of two terms, namely:
 "control product" which means any product, device, organism, substance or thing that is manufactured, represented, sold or used as a means for directly or indirectly controlling, preventing, destroying, mitigating, attracting or repelling any pest.
 "pest" which means any injurious, noxious or troublesome insect, fungus, bacterial organism, virus, weed, rodent or other plant or animal pest, and includes any injurious, noxious or troublesome organic function of a plant or animal.
 Any pest control product imported, sold or used in Canada must be registered by the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Health Canada.
 This measure applies to every active ingredient, manufacturing concentrates, as well as to all end-use products containing such ingredients.
 By the end of its registration process and before it is marketed, each product is given a sequential registration number, which must appear on its label.
 Registration process is summed up in the document The Regulation of Pesticides in Canada.
 In Canada, over 550 active ingredients are being used in some 6000 commercial products.
 You may consult their label contents by using the Search Product Label tool, created and updated by the PMRA.
 Research work can be done in using the active ingredient name, trade name or product registration number.

 In addition, certain pesticides are named biopesticides by the PMRA.
 The definition includes:
 naturally occurring or genetically altered microorganisms (microbials) (bacteria, fungus, virus, protozoan or algae) (Guidelines for the Registration of Microbial Pest Control Agents and Products); Products);
 pheromones (Guidelines for the Research and Registration of Pest Control Products Containing Pheromones and Other Semiochemicals); Semiochemicals);
 pesticides, including biochemicals, that have been accepted and registered as biopesticides by the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 At provincial level level
 In Qu�bec, under the Pesticides Act, the word "pesticide" means any substance, matter or microorganism intended to directly or indirectly control, destroy, mitigate, attract or repel any organism that is injurious to or noxious or troublesome for humans, animal life, vegetation, crops or any other object, or intended for use as a plant growth regulator, except a vaccine or a medication other than a topical medication for external use on animals.
 It is important to know that Qu�bec legislation applies to pesticides registered by the PMRA.
 Moreover, some pest control products are not subject to Qu�bec legislation, namely:
 algicides or bactericides for swimming pools and aquariums or for the treatment of drinking water; water;
 air cleaners; cleaners;
 disinfectants; disinfectants;
 detergent additives; additives;
 mechanical or physical mechanisms, such as apparatuses to attract and destroy flying insects, ionizers for algae control in swimming pools and spas, devices to repel pests by causing physical discomfort by means of sound, touch or electromagnetic radiation.
 Although 4700 products and 450 active ingredients meet the Qu�bec pesticide definition, only 1100 products and 300 active ingredients are actually sold within the province�s territory (Account of pesticides sales in Qu�bec).
 Pesticides grouping grouping
 Usually, pesticides are named according to their grouping which takes into account the product�s target, its origin and chemical structure, how it is marketed as well as the target site and its mode of action.
 A pesticide can be grouped according to the following criteria:
 category of use; use;
 origin; origin;
 chemical group; group;
 type of formulation; formulation;
 type of activity; activity;
 site or mode of action.
 Category of use use
 Most of the pesticides can be grouped according to their target.
 Note that the suffix �cide means "to kill".
 Category of use Targets Examples of targets targets
 Miticide Mite House dust mite mite
 Maple bladdergall mite mite
 Twospotted spider mite mite
 Avicide Birds Pigeon Pigeon
 Insecticide Insects Cockroach Cockroach
 Colorado potato beetle beetle
 Hairy chinch bug bug
 Eastern spruce budworm budworm
 Herbicide Undesirable plants Lamb�s-quarter Lamb�s-quarter
 Quack grass grass
 Poison ivy ivy
 Plantain Plantain
 Fungicide Microscopic fungi causing plant diseases Diplocarpon rosae causing rose black spot spot
 Pucciniastrum epilobii causing fir needle rust rust
 Venturia inaequalis causing apple scab scab
 Piscicide Fish White sucker sucker
 Rodenticide Rodents Rat Rat
 Mouse Mouse
 Molluscicide Terrestrial molluscs Snail Snail
 Slug Slug
 Nematicide Nematodes causing plant diseases Meloidogyne hapla causing carrot root knot knot
 Also, some pesticides� names end with the suffix �fuge which means "to repel", as in the word "insectifuge", which means "insect repellent".
 Other pesticides, which name includes �cide as a suffix, such as "ovicide", "larvicide" or "adulticide", designate substances specifically intended for destroying insects at the egg, larvae or adult stage.
 Other categories of use exist, which are:
 wood preservative; preservative;
 vaccine or anti-pest medication for external use on animals; animals;
 pruning paint; paint;
 antifouling paint; paint;
 pheromone; pheromone;
 plant growth regulator; regulator;
 animal repellent.
 Origin Origin
 Usually pesticides are grouped in two categories:
 organic and inorganic pesticides.
 Organic pesticides contain carbon, while inorganic pesticides contain carbon which can be found only under the form of carbonate or cyanide.
 These pesticides are derivatives made from arsenic, mercury, fluorine, sulphur and copper, as well as derivatives made from cyanide.
 Organic pesticides can be divided into three groups:
 synthetic pesticides (developed in laboratories and manufactured), natural pesticides (from animal, microbial or vegetal origin) and microorganisms.
 Inorganic pesticides are mostly derived from minerals.
 Chemical group group
 A chemical group is formed with pesticides which have a similar chemical structure.
 For example, the chemical structure of atrazine shown in the following diagrams allows putting this pesticide in the triazines and tetrazines group.
 Chemical groups established by the Minist�re du D�veloppement durable, de l�Environnement et des Parcs are described in the Guide for classification of pesticides by chemical group.
 Type of formulation formulation
 Pesticides are available in different formulations and can be obtained under solid, liquid or gaseous form.
 Some pesticides are marketed as ready-to-use products, in other words they do not need any special preparation before application.
 On the other hand, others do need to be prepared.
 For example, some products may need to be mixed in exact proportions with water before application.
 This mixture usually called spray mixture, is then applied on the undesirable organism.
 In this very case, preparation is diluting a concentrated product.
 Formulant examples Ready to use or to be mixed mixed
 Solid form form
 Bait Ready to use use
 Powder Ready to use use
 Wettable powder To be mixed mixed
 Liquid form form
 Spray Ready to use use
 Emulsifiable concentrate To be mixed mixed
 Solution To be mixed mixed
 Gaseous form form
 Fumigant Ready to use use
 Type of activity activity
 Herbicides, fungicides and insecticides can be designated according to their action on undesirable organisms.
 Herbicide Herbicide
 Contact Is active only on plant parts that are covered with it.
 Systemic Absorbed by the plant, this herbicide moves inside it.
 Selective Herbicide that destroys certain plants among those being under treatment.
 Non selective Controls all of the treated plants.
 R�siduaire Residual A product that breaks down slowly and controls plants over a long time.
 Non residual Action ceases quickly after application and controls plants over a short time.
 Fungicide Fungicide
 Protective Protects the plant prior the disease infection by preventing the latter to develop.
 Eradicant Fights a disease which has already developed.
 Insecticide Insecticide
 Contact Acts when insect is in contact with the product.
 Inhalation Acts when insect inhales the product.
 Ingestion Acts when insect feeds on product.
 Site or mode of action action
 Pesticides can be grouped according to the site or mode of action on the undesirable organism on which they act.
 Several sites or modes of action are known for herbicides, insecticides as well as fungicides.
 Here are some examples:
 Insecticides control insects:
 by interfering on their nervous system, or or
 by preventing moulting from the larval to the adult stage.
 Herbicides control plants:
 by inhibiting photosynthesis, or or
 by reproducing effects of plant growth regulators which they produce naturally.
 Fungicides control fungi:
 by inhibiting amino acid synthesis, or or
 by interfering with cell division.
 The list of pesticides groups constituted according the site or mode of action is available in the federal registration directive Voluntary Pesticide Resistance-Management Labelling Based on Target Site/Mode of Action.
 Glossary Glossary
 Registration:
 an administrative act authorizing the sale, importation or use of pest control products in Canada.
 Topical medication for animals:
 external use product which acts where it is applied on the animal.
 These medications relate mainly to two product ranges:
 those intended for house pets (for example, shampoo, lotion, powder, anti-flea collars and tags for dogs and cats) and those intended for livestock and cattle (for example, insecticide ear tags for cattle).
 Pheromone:
 a message-bearing substance produced by a plant or animal, or a synthetic analogue of that substance that evokes a behavioural response in individuals of the same or other species.

 A Toxic Tally and Our Task Task
 A California grower called Rachel Carson Council because she was worried about her fruit trees, which were not thriving at the time.
 She wondered whether sulfonylurea herbicides sprayed nearby during the previous year could have harmed them.
 From research data presented at our September 1998 conference on Wildlife, Pesticides and People, we now know that herbicides of the sulfonylurea class, could very well have damaged those trees and that they could have done so at fractions of the dose required to kill weeds.
 This case points out the public's need to know more about pesticides' toxic effects (see issue # 4).
 Read on for a tally of ten issues from various sources including our recent Wildlife, Pesticides and People conference:
 1.Due to vulnerability of the developing fetus to chemicals, pregnant women have been warned to avoid or restrict their exposure to pesticides.
 (Anon.
 "End all pesticide exposure during pregnancy, EPA warns," Pesticide & Toxic Chemical News, 1-18-95) 1-18-95)
 2.Children born to parents working as pesticide applicators showed increased deformities.
 Rates of deformities almost as high were found among the children of non-applicators living in an area of high pesticide use, especially those infants conceived in the spring.
 (Dr.
 V.
 Garry, et al., "Pesticide appliers, biocides and birth defects in rural Minnesota," Environmental Health Perspectives, v104(4), April 1996) 1996)
 3.Sixty seven million birds are estimated to be killed by pesticides in the U.S.
 annually.
 (Dr.
 David Pimentel, et al., "Economic and environmental costs of pesticide use") use")
 4.A new sulfonylurea herbicide, chlorsulfuron, has been found, in an EPA test, to damage cherry trees at 1/500th the label application rate.
 EPA does not usually require studies of herbicides' effects on woody plants such as trees before products are allowed to be registered.
 There are no simple means to determine the presence of these chemicals in the environment.
 Assay tests for all marketed chemical pesticides, including sulfonylureas, should be, but are not now required.
 (Rachel Carson Council's Wildlife, Pesticides & People Conference) Conference)
 5.Frogs living in ponds in close proximity to pesticide use had deformity rates of 20%.
 In ponds existing on abandoned farms where pesticides had not been used for some time, the frog deformity rate was 2% at most.
 (Dr.
 Ouellet, page 2, Pesticide & Toxic Chemical News, Nov.
 12, 1998) 1998)
 6.Most streams from developed watersheds in the U.S.
 were found contaminated with multiple pesticides.
 The concentration of dissolved pesticides in stream water was the single most reliable predictor of endocrine disruption in carp.
 (Rachel Carson Council's Wildlife, Pesticides & People Conference) Conference)
 7.A mixture of atrazine and various organophosphates was found to be more toxic than would have been predicted from the additive effect of the individual chemicals' toxicities; an example of synergism.
 (Pape-Lindstrom & Lydy, "Synergistic toxicity of atrazine and organophosphate insecticides contravenes the response addition mixture model," Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, v.16(11), 2415-2420,1997) 2415-2420,1997)
 8.Pesticide mixtures, not single chemicals, occur as the result of actual use.
 Their hazards to people and to significant groups of wildlife (including amphibians, reptiles, and aquatic invertebrates) as well as to non-crop vegetation remain largely unresearched.
 Too little of such information is now required by the EPA for pesticide registration.
 (Rachel Carson Council's Wildlife, Pesticides & People Conference) Conference)
 9.Pesticide labels may contain warnings and prohibitions against product use around certain wildlife.
 Yet because these statements may be ambiguous and not prominently displayed, their protective value is questionable.
 10.Carcinogenic pesticides can be applied with impunity virtually everywhere despite the growing numbers of human and animal cancers linked to these chemicals.
 (Rachel Carson Council's Cancer and Pesticides Conference) Conference)
 11.In short, deformed frogs, fish with unnatural endocrine function, cherry trees with reduced yield, pollinator losses, surface waters carrying a chemical cocktail, birth deformities and cancer are associated with chemical pesticides.
 These represent findings of the researchers from universities and government agencies to which the Council has turned for information.
 At our recent Wildlife, Pesticides and People conference a number of scientists concluded their presentations with pleas for reduced reliance on chemical pesticides and for substitution of Integrated Pest Management, with chemicals as an option to be used as a last resort or to be avoided.
 Their message needs to go out to the public.
 This is our task.
 Below are solutions to pesticide issues identified through our research and our recent conference.
 These solutions have not yet been implemented.
 In the words of Jean Rostand quoted by Rachel Carson in Silent Spring, "The obligation to endure gives us the right to know." know."
 We need to urge the EPA to:
 �Require that every pesticide label include advice to pregnant women to avoid or restrict their exposure to chemical pesticides.
 �Actively promote and explain in the media and on pesticide product labels the concept of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) as an appropriate means of dealing with unwanted species.
 This definition should specify use of the least toxic methods including strategic planning (such as crop rotation and diversity in agriculture) and biological controls as the first steps in minimizing pest problems and use of toxic chemicals only as the last resort.
 �Recognize that wild birds, which should be protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), are being illegally killed by pesticides and make a serious effort to end this loss of resources.
 Immediately include an explanation of the MBTA on each pesticide label and take whatever additional steps are required to protect migratory birds including product banning.
 �Give greater consideration to wording and prominence on product labels of warnings and prohibitions related to pesticide use around wildlife.
 �Devote more Agency resources to the monitoring of pesticide effects on people, pets and wildlife through collecting, evaluating and making available to the public on product labels pesticide incident report information.
 �Include in the pre-marketing assessment for pesticide hazards additional wildlife such as beneficial insects, beneficial fungi, woody plants, native vegetation, aquatic grasses, aquatic invertebrates, reptiles, amphibians, fish, marine mammals and songbirds.
 Take whatever steps are required to protect wild plants and animals from further pesticide damage, including warnings on labels and when necessary product banning.
 �Give more information on inert ingredients on pesticide product labels.
 �Require that an assay be developed to detect each active ingredient and any bioactive by-products, as a necessary prerequisite for environmental safety, before a pesticide is allowed to be registered by the Agency.
 �Devote more resources to studying the toxicity of commonly occurring combinations of pesticides on people and wildlife and act on such information when required to achieve better protection.
 �Identify pesticide formulations containing carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic chemicals through labeling information and as soon as possible ban those causing cancer and developmental damage.
 �Inform users that even following label directions will not keep chemical pesticides out of surface water, once they have been released into the outdoor environment.

 Chemicals and pesticides pesticides
 The Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) regulates the use of chemicals and pesticides in New South Wales to reduce exposure and minimise impacts on the environment including plants, animals and people.
 This involves developing and enforcing chemical control and pesticide use laws, including regulating remediation technologies for treating chemical and pesticide wastes and controlling major industrial spills and other hazardous incidents.
 OEH also provides information and advice on management of chemicals and pesticides.
 Much of this section of the website applies to industries that use and manufacture chemicals and pesticides.
 It contains material and links on:
 national chemicals management management
 safe use, management and disposal disposal
 minimising environmental impacts impacts
 managing chemical and pesticide wastes wastes
 cleaning up contaminated land.
 Household use and disposal deals with the use of chemicals in the home and garden, and in do-it-yourself renovation.
 Find out here about sustainable approaches to household cleaning and gardening, safe pet care and renovation advice.
 People who work regularly with pesticides in NSW, such as market gardeners and farmers, and those working in the pest control and weed control industries, will find useful information in this section on:
 appropriate management of pesticides pesticides
 legislation governing pesticide use use
 record keeping, training and notification requirements requirements
 pesticide control orders governing the use of restricted chemical products.
 There is also information for public authority and local council workers on notification of pesticide use in public places and residential complexes.
 Successful educational programs in the area of agricultural chemicals including pesticides, drugs, food and feed additives require the combined efforts of numerous specialists in all program phases including planning, action, and evaluation.
 Each extension specialist concerned must individually and collectively come to an understanding and appreciation of what his contribution should be.
 Role and Responsibilities of the Pesticide-Pest Control Program Leader Leader
 Pesticide safety education cannot be separated from the proper efficient use education programs.
 Much of the effort must continue to be an important part of the ongoing work of the state extension specialists, especially those personnel concerned with weed, insect, and disease control, chemical application methods, animal nutrition, and veterinary science.
 Safe use must be a responsibility and consideration of each of those staff members.
 In addition, wildlife, water, and public health specialists must concern themselves with certain phases of pesticide use.
 It is necessary that the right climate and organizational structure be developed to provide good working relationships between state specialists.
 Obviously, for any given project, some specialists have greater contributions to make than others, and the structure should allow each individual to contribute in line with the needs for his capabilities.
 Coordination is the key to success in these efforts.
 It is essential if a correct balance between combined and individual efforts are to be achieved.
 It is also essential if programs are to have direction.
 In achieving a coordinated effort, it would seem logical that one individual should be appointed and held responsible for coordination and leadership of programs in the areas of weed, insect, and disease control, chemical application methods, feed and food additives and veterinary drugs.
 Such a chemical coordinator-program leader can help bring about the optimum effort on the part of each specialist as well as strengthen the working relationships between specialists.
 The work of the chemical coordinator-program leader is a full time job.
 It is doubtful if he could devote much time to the specialist role, but rather should make a major effort in leadership and coordination, and as a staff consultant to specialists in his unique areas of competence, which includes State and Federal pesticide regulation and registration, residue problems and side effects, and safe use aspects.
 In this respect, the chemical coordinator can assist with many of the functions of the Project leader.
 In addition, the coordinator can establish liaison and smooth working relationships with other branches of the university as well as Federal, State, and local agencies concerned with agricultural chemicals and pest control.
 The coordinator should have authority commensurate with responsibility in order that the work may be accomplished.
 The chemical coordinator should have suitable ability and experience and training to serve, if not in line administration, at least in a staff position as an important member of the group that guides policy direction and function within an extension service.
 Responsibilities of the Chemical Coordinator-Program Leader Leader
 1.Development and maintenance of a chemical information and reference center that would contain:
 Federal and State information on registration, uses, and residue restrictions for chemicals chemicals
 Information on toxicology, hazards, side effect problems, etc., of these chemicals.
 Federal and State law data such as -- FIFRA, FEDCA, MID, PID Inspection Acts as applies to chemicals.
 FAA and aerial applicators regulations, state laws governing pesticides.
 2.Keep extension, experiment station, and other University personnel informed and up to date on all aspects of the information maintained in the chemical information center as it relates to their subject matter.
 In some extension services it may also be desirable to keep county extension personnel informed.
 3.To coordinate extension service activities and programs in areas of pest control and agricultural chemicals including pesticides, food and feed additives, drugs, household pesticides and chemicals, etc.
 4.To assist and provide leadership for extension specialists with development of their programs as they relate to chemical use and safety including problem identification, information release, communications, etc.
 To conduct and assist with in-service professional improvement sessions for specialists and county agents.
 To conduct and assist with "in-depth schools" for commercial and professional people associated with pesticide use.
 5.To provide leadership for extension personnel in programs involving the so called safety aspects of pesticides including toxicity and injury problems, wildlife, and environmental hazard prevention.
 6.To establish and maintain liaison with Federal, State, and local agencies involved with agricultural chemicals -- Such as:
 State Department of Agriculture, City and State Departments of Health, including poison control center organizations, State Department of Conservation, Fish and Game, State Department of Air and Water Pollution, United States Public Health Service, United States Food and Drug Administration, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Department of Agriculture, including PPC, ARS, FES, PRD, MID.
 7.To oversee extension service programs to insure that educational programs in these areas are based on unbiased facts, that Extension Service preserve it educational integrity and function and that it stay out of regulatory function and does not become a pawn of special interest groups.
 8.To aid other faculty members (research and teaching) in adhering to the rules and regulations of Federal and State agricultural chemical laws and college or University policy.
 9.To take those steps necessary to insure that all chemical use educational programs of the Extension Service are in compliance with Federal and State regulation and will not result in harm to the user, other animals, plants, or environmental pollution pollution

 Implementation in Virginia Virginia
 In 1965, an appropriation was passed by Congress that provided $2,100,000 in payments to the states for expansion of educational programs on the safe and proper use of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals, excluding fertilizers.
 Virginia's share of these funds was $41,732.
 To support the allocation of these funds, Virginia Cooperative Extension Service submitted a plan of work that incorporated the following:
 1.A statement of significant pesticide chemical problems of the people to be served which can be solved in total or in part by educational endeavor and a description of the situation which creates these problems.
 This is most important part of the total plan because it is here where you identify the specific problems and the specific situation which creates the problems.
 2.A statement of the objectives which clearly outlines what will be done to solve the pesticide problem.
 Each objective should include the clientele involved, the action to be taken, and the planned changes which the action should bring about.
 It will be noted in this that it infers that you have a number of pesticide problems.
 Therefore, the objective could not be general but would have to be specific toward the specific pesticide problem.
 3.A general statement describing Extension methods to be used in helping solve each of the problems.
 These methods should indicate coordination with other groups and techniques and activities to be used; such as, special studies, pilot or exploratory projects, demonstrations, radio and TV programs, publications, etc.
 It will be noted in this part of the plan we must use methods to solve each of the specific problems outlined under number 1.
 4.The plans for evaluation of progress and accomplishments, which indicate what methods and techniques of evaluation will be used and when intermediary and final accomplishments of evaluation are done.
 The practice of the BBKA of endorsing certain pesticide products as being �bee-friendly�, and receiving donations from the pharmaceutical companies in return, is again coming under attack.
 The matter is on the agenda for the next Annual Delegates� Meeting at Stoneleigh in January, and is therefore up for discussion at the next Committee meeting of the CBKA on December 6th.
 As usual the situation is far more complicated than some people with radical views would have us believe.
 I have been trying to sort out the wood from the trees, and I am sharing with you my findings so far.
 If I am wrong in anything I have stated, I would welcome a correction.
 There is a lot of information (as usual, rather too much!) on the internet.
 Several links were sent out with the October E-News.
 I can supply website addresses to any member who requests them.
 The latest criticism of the BBKA policy has arisen following scares to do with neo-nicotinoid pesticides, which have led to bee-deaths on the continent, and which are produced by Bayer � one of the firms from which BBKA receives donations.
 There are two main neo-nicotinoids on the market in the UK � Imidacloprid (sold under various names:
 Gaucho, Admire, Confidor and Winner).and Clothianidin.
 Clothianidin killed many colonies in South-west Germany this summer when it was used as a maize seed-dressing in a high concentration.
 The pesticide dust had not been fixed effectively to the seeds and blew off when they were sown, polluting the surrounding countryside.
 According to official figures, 11,500 colonies were damaged by this poisoning episode.
 As a result, the German Government suspended the registration of eight neo-nicotinoid pesticide seed-treatment products used for oilseed rape and maize.
 Imidacloprid killed huge numbers of bees in France between 1996 and 2000, after which it was banned by the French Government for use on sunflowers.
 In Canada it is believed that clover and OSR crops have sub-lethal residues (picked up from the soil) of imidacloprid in the pollen and nectar which are causing the slow death of colonies.
 Imidacloprid is still legal in the USA, and is now apparently being used as a seed-dressing for sugar beet in the UK.
 Earlier this year there was a scare caused by the allegation that beet-sugar (which you might use as a feed for your bees) was contaminated by neo-nicotinoid pesticides which had been applied to the beet crop.
 Many beekeepers went off in search of cane sugar, even though we have no guarantee (especially since cane sugar is produced in far-off countries) that this is any safer.
 �Ambrosia� is basically corn syrup, made from maize, which is one of the crops most heavily treated with pesticides, so that is just as likely to be contaminated.
 The following statement by British Sugar would seem to clear up the matter.
 "UK sugar beet is not sprayed with any neo-nicotinoid pesticide and none are approved for such use.
 Sugar-beet is not a flowering plant and hence does not attract bees.
 Neo-nicotinoid pesticides are approved for use in the protective seed-coating used to aid plant-germination and early growth.
 The coating degrades naturally in the soil and beet-plant, and is inactive by May when the plant becomes established.
 Home-produced sugar is subject to a comprehensive residue testing programme and no neo-nicotinoid pesticides have been detected in British sugar.
 Therefore home-produced beet-sugar poses no risk to bees.� This all sounds quite plausible.
 Sugar beet can yield 50t/ha, and about 17% of that weight will end up as sugar.
 The amount of pesticide that can be applied to seed is infinitesimal compared with that sort of harvest volume.
 Studies have shown that only 0.1% of the imidacloprid applied as a seed dressing ends up in the root � where the sugar comes from.
 I have compiled some facts about neo-nicotinoids.
 Neo-nicotinoid pesticides are what are called �systemic�, which means that they are absorbed into every cell of the plant, including, logically, nectar and pollen.
 The question is whether they would be present in a sufficient concentration to harm bees feeding on this nectar or pollen.
 No-one is supplying an impartial, reliable answer to this question at the moment.
 Imidacloprid is a powerful neurotoxin, lethal to bees in doses as small as five parts per billion; at lower doses, it may not kill the bees outright, but is thought to lead to worker bees neglecting to feed larvae, and to a breakdown of the bees' navigational abilities � it is therefore thought by some to be a possible contributory factor in CCD.
 Imidacloprid is persistent in plant cells and in the soil (half-life in soil under aerobic conditions of up to 3 years), where it kills all insects and earthworms, and it accumulates, season on season, until it reaches a 'stable' level, assumed by some authorities to be something like 10 parts per billion.
 It also rapidly contaminates ground water.
 In a study undertaken as long ago as 1996, sugar beet plants sown from imidacloprid-treated seeds were tested for pesticide content in leaves and roots.
 21 days after application a concentration of 15.2 micrograms per gram of fresh plant was found.
 97 days after sowing this had fallen to 0.5 micro-grams per gram.
 In sugar-beet, which is not allowed to flower, these figures are unimportant.
 What they would mean in the nectar or pollen of a honey-bee forage-plant, however, I still can�t tell.
 The plant metabolises the imidacloprid, and this metabolite is a more effective insecticide than the original compound, explaining the prolonged effectiveness against aphids�which is an attribute attractive to growers.
 (2) (2)
 According to a recent report, the remains of spray poisons have been found in 49% of the investigated fruit, vegetables and corn-products � representing an increase of 20% over the last five years.
 For the first time traces of imidacloprid were found in food for human consumption.(3) consumption.(3)
 The UK Pesticides Safety Directorate has issued the following statement.
 We are aware of the concerns in some other Member States about the use of certain seed treatments containing clothianidin and imidacloprid.
 However, we are not aware of any problem in the UK related to any seed treatments and bees.
 There have not been any incidents reported to the Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme (WIIS) to date which could be connected to the use of seed treatment.
 Given the vigilance of beekeepers, it is highly unlikely that had there been any incidents they would have gone unnoticed.
 Of the three active substances which are mentioned, only imidacloprid is approved for treatment of oilseed rape seed and clothianidin for maize seed.
 This is the first year in which treatment of maize seed with clothianidin has been approved in the UK.
 We note that in the incidents in Germany the treatment was being used at a very high rate (125 g.a.s/ha) in an attempt to control Diabrotica.
 In the UK it is approved at a maximum rate of 60 g.a.s./ha on maize.
 We will, of course, keep a close watch on the situation, but currently have no concerns that use of these products according to the conditions of approval will cause a risk to bees in the UK.
 This statement is not as reassuring as it might sound.
 The fact that beekeepers have not reported a problem does not prove that a problem does not exist.
 It is very difficult for beekeepers (with our very limited resources) to identify the cause of a dwindling or loss of our bees, particularly when the amount of pesticide which could cause a problem would be of the magnitude of one microgram per 100g � that means one millionth of a gram per 1000 bees.
 The BBKA does not endorse any neo-nicotinoid pesticide, but it has been criticised by some French and German beekeepers for not joining their associations in calls for a ban on neo-nicotinoids.
 The Greek BKA has just issued a call on all European beekeeping associations to press for a Europe-wide ban on these pesticides.
 Mike Harris, general secretary of the British Bee Keepers Association, is quoted as saying:
 �Colony Collapse Disorder is caused by the varroa parasite.
 Pesticides are a separate problem - and in the UK, at least, neo-nicotinoids are not normally used in concentrations harmful to bees." bees."
 However, pesticides were under discussion at a recent symposium on CCD at the University of Warwick as a possible contributory factor in CCD.
 (1) It has to be said here that the pesticides most under suspicion are those used by beekeepers against varroa! However, the interaction (synergy) between various pesticides is still under consideration as a contributory factor.
 The BBKA accepts donations from Bayer, Syngenta and other companies, totalling �13,000 per annum, no one company contributing more than �5000.
 Martin Smith, the BBKA Chairman, issued the following statement on the policy.
 �The policy of the BBKA, established some years ago and endorsed by its membership at an Annual Delegates Meeting, is one of constructive engagement with such companies to ensure that the products are sold with the correct instructions to farmers in relation to when and how to spray to ensure that honey bees are not affected.
 �Members of the BBKA Technical Committee meet the relevant companies periodically to ensure that we are aware of products coming onto the market, and discuss their possible effect on honey-bees.
 We review the products we already endorse in the light of any new evidence that may become available and ensure that the instructions to farmers remain pertinent.
 We also provide the companies with advice about the habits of honey-bees to assist in their formulation of new products.� products.�
 There are two strands to the question of the BBKA�s involvement with pharmaceutical companies.
 1) Should the BBKA hold meetings with such companies, at which new products and their methods of use are discussed, leading to the BBKA either approving them as �bee-friendly� or withholding this approval?
 The BBKA says that, without the promise of an endorsement, there would be no incentive for the companies to meet with the BBKA, and we would then lose our leverage on them in terms of their marketing and usage instructions.
 2) Whether or not it holds discussions with such companies, should the BBKA accept donations from them?
 As with politicians, this can at least be seen to reduce the BBKA�s independence, and lessen its voice in combating misuse/overuse of chemicals in the environment.
 STOP PRESS! I have just learned that the BBKA executive is proposing to the ADM that the donations should be put into a research fund, rather than into the BBKA�s coffers, which would necessitate a �1 rise in membership fees.
 I hope this will help members to make up their minds on this very complicated question, and that you will have enough time to discuss this with your representatives before the committee meeting, or at least before the ADM in January.

 Insecticide and Fungicide seed treatment treatment
 Seed treatment is a term that describes both products and processes.
 The usages of specific products and specific techniques can improve the growth environment for the seed, seedlings and young plants.
 Seed treatment complexity ranges from a basic dressing to coating and pelleting.
 1.
 Seed dressing:
 This is the most common method of seed treatment.
 The seed is dressed with either a dry formulation or wet treated with a slurry or liquid formulation.
 Dressings can be applied at both farm and industries.
 Low cost earthen pots can be used for mixing pesticides with seed or seed can be spread on a polythene sheet and required quantity of chemical can be sprinkled on seed lot and mixed mechanically by the farmers.
 2.
 Seed coating:
 A special binder is used with a formulation to enhance adherence to the seed.
 Coating requires advanced treatment technology, by the industry.
 3.
 Seed Pelleting:
 The most sophisticated Seed Treatment Technology, resulting in changing physical shape of a seed to enhance pelletibility and handling.
 Pelleting requires specialized application machinery and techniques and is the most expensive application.
 Natural seed treatment could drastically cut pesticide use use
 The technology - which makes plants significantly more resistant to pests - has now been licensed for use by US agricultural company Becker Underwood in collaboration with Plant Bioscience Limited.

 Scientists have long understood that spraying crops with jasmonic acid - a chemical naturally produced by plant leaves when attacked by insects - reduces pest attack.
 But crops treated with the chemical don't grow as well as those that are untreated.
 Researchers at Lancaster University's Environment Centre and Stockbridge Technology Centre found that plants grown from seeds dipped in jasmonic acid are considerably more resistant to pests.
 The chemical seems to prime some plants' natural protective responses.
 Early trials at Lancaster University saw promising results when researchers treated the seeds of tomato plants, sweet pepper and maize.
 Red spider mite attack on tomato plants was down by 80 per cent, aphid attack on sweet peppers cut by 70 per cent and caterpillar damage to maize was reduced by 38 per cent.
 Initial results were so encouraging that Becker Underwood quickly started large-scale field trials in a number of commercially-important agricultural crops in the US.
 Their results showed clear reductions in pest damage with increased crop yields, and has led to the company negotiating a worldwide exclusive licence to use the technology.
 'The potential for significant yield improvement due to the lessening of plant damage caused by pests is very exciting,' says Eda Reinot, head of research and development at Becker Underwood.
 'When we first set out to test jasmonic acid on seeds, it seemed unlikely it would work,' says Dr Nigel Paul, who led the research at Lancaster University.
 'So for it now to be licensed for commercial use so soon after our initial research is very exciting.' exciting.'
 Applying jasmonic acid to seeds protects many crops for at least ten weeks after germination of the seeds.
 Treated seeds can also be stored and sown at a later stage.
 'We think treating seeds with jasmonic acid acts rather like immunisation, protecting plants for an extended period after treatment,' says Dr Jason Moore, a member of the Lancaster team.
 Until now, genetic modification (GM) technology has been touted as the best hope for increasing crop yields without using excessive pesticides.
 But GM has long been unpopular in many countries.
 What makes jasmonic acid so exciting is that it is a more natural way to protect plants.
 In addition to cutting pesticide use, the new technology could be a financially beneficial alternative for farmers and growers using pesticides, because seeds are cheaper to treat than whole crops.
 The original research showing the effect of jasmonic acid on seeds was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (Nerc) and the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board.
 But it was further work funded by a Nerc scheme to investigate developing research outcomes into commercially-viable products that proved the commercial potential of treating seeds with jasmonic acid.
 'The seed treatment started out as pure ecology, but with the support of our funders and now PBL and Becker Underwood, it's developed into a new technology that could really help improve food production around the world,' adds Paul.
 The Lancaster team now want to take their research further.
 They are investigating its value in disease control and further funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council will allow the researchers to explore exactly how jasmonic acid works its magic on plant seeds.
 Pesticide News Story:
 EPA Acts to Protect BeesQuick Resources Resources
 Pollinator Protection Protection
 The EPA has received a number of inquiries since 2008 about bee deaths in Germany associated with the use of the pesticide clothianidin and whether this incident might be related to Colony Collapse Disorder.
 Based on discussions with German authorities, we believe this incident is not related to CCD.
 Although pesticide exposure is one of four theoretical factors associated with CCD that the United States Department of Agriculture is researching, the facts in this case are not consistent with what we know about CCD.
 CCD is characterized by a relatively rapid decline in the adult bee population of a hive; typically only the queen, a few nurse bees and brood remain in the CCD-affected hive.
 Reported incidents of CCD have detected few if any dead adult bees.
 The 2008 incident in Germany, however, was associated with large numbers of dead adult bees in and around the hives.
 Additionally, testing showed clothianidin residues in the dead bees and their hives.
 According to German authorities, the May 2008 incident resulted from inadvertent exposure of the bees to clothianidin, an insecticide used for corn seed treatment, resulting from a combination of factors.
 These factors include the specific formulation of the pesticide used, weather conditions and type of application equipment:
 The formulation of the pesticide clothianidin used to protect seed corn from corn root worm in Germany did not include a polymer seed coating known as a "sticker." This coating makes the pesticide product stick to the seed.
 Although the formulation used in the United States also does not require a �sticker� on corn seed, the major seed suppliers and distributors, agricultural industry groups, and clothianidin�s registrant have confirmed that it is typical practice to use �stickers� on corn seed in the United States.
 Normally, corn is planted before canola blooms and attracts bees.
 Because early, heavy rains delayed the corn planting in Germany in 2008, the seeds were sown later than usual when nearby canola crops were in bloom and bees were present.
 A particular type of air-driven equipment used to sow the seeds apparently blew clothianidin-laden dust off the seeds and into the air as the seeds were ejected from the machine and into the ground.
 Finally, dry and windy conditions at the time of planting blew the dust into the neighboring canola fields that were in bloom and where honey bees were foraging.
 Together, these factors helped create the circumstances under which this incident occurred.
 It is worth noting, however, that though clothianidin was the particular chemical involved in the 2008 incident in Germany, a similar result would be expected if a large amount of any chemical that is toxic to bees was blown into the air on a dry, windy day next to blooming canola fields for which thousands of hives were providing pollination services.
 An additional noteworthy point is that the primary purpose of �sticker� is efficacy; if the pesticide falls off the seed before or during planting, it won�t protect the plant as it grows.
 Therefore, it benefits both bees and farmers to use the sticking agent.
 While the 2008 incident in Germany is not related to CCD and only coincidentally related to clothianidin, the EPA is examining its practices with respect to label requirements for seed treatment pesticides and will revise them as necessary to prevent the types of exposure that led to the bee deaths.
 Our initial focus will be on seed treatment pesticides that we know can be toxic to bees and whether the use of stickers or coatings should be required.
 In many situations, the use of pesticide-treated seeds results in less human and environmental exposure than would the use of the pesticide later, in a spray or dust formulation, after the crop is growing.
 We want to make sure that seed treatment is done according to best practices that minimize human and environmental exposure.
 Cruiser� is a systemic insecticide which belongs to a subclass of neonicotinoids.
 With an excellent seed safety margin, Cruiser protects plants from a broad spectrum of seed, soil and foliar chewing and sucking insects to help get crops off to a healthy, vigorous start.
 Studies show that seed treated with Cruiser results in improved plant stand, vigor and yield.
 Commercially applied by seed companies at low use rates, Cruiser offers a convenient way to replace planter box, in-furrow and foliar insecticide applications for early-season insects.
 The Thiamethoxam Vigor� Effect Effect
 More than 10 years of research has led scientists to the discovery of why thiamethoxam, the active ingredient in Cruiser seed treatment insecticide, offers growers significantly more robust and vigorous plants.
 Typically known for offering growers effective insect protection on a variety of crops around the world, thiamethoxam also is scientifically linked to increased vigor that is evidenced by faster emergence, greater plant stands, earlier canopy, increased root mass and higher yield potential even in situations where there is no visible pest attack.
 This Thiamethoxam Vigor� effect is patented in the United States and in 18 other countries.
 Additional patents are being pursued.

 the report on that account.
 On the other hand, any suggestion that GM crops and pesticides may be causing the decline of honeybees is met with heated denial from the proponents.
 Certainly, honeybees are declining both in areas where GM crops are widely grown, and in other areas where GM crops are released in small test plots.
 Is there a common thread that links both areas?
 Yes there is, the universal use of systemic pesticide seed dressing in GM crops and conventional crops; in particular, the widespread application of a relatively new class of systemic insecticides - the neonicotinoids - that are highly toxic to insects including bees at very low concentrations.
 Systemic pesticide seed dressings protect the newly sprouted seed at a vulnerable time in the plant�s development.
 Seed dressings include systemic insecticides and fungicides, which often act synergistically in controlling early seedling pests.
 The neonicotinoid insecticides include imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and several others.
 Imidacloprid is used extensively in seed dressing for field and horticultural crops, and particularly for maize, sunflower and rapeseed (canola).
 Imidacloprid was detected in soils, plant tissues and pollen using HPLC coupled to a mass spectrometer.
 The levels of the insecticide found in pollen suggested probable delirious effects on honeybees [3].
 For several years since 2000, French and Italian beekeepers have been noticing that imidacloprid is lethal to bees, and the insecticide is suspected to be causing the decline of hive populations by affecting the bee�s orientation and ability to return to the hive.
 Confused and disoriented bees bees
 A team of scientist led by the National Institute of Beekeeping in Bologna, Italy, found that pollen obtained from seeds dressed with imidacloprid contains significant levels of the insesticide, and suggested that the polluted pollen was one of the main causes of honeybee colony collapse [4].
 Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with imidacloprid indicated that large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies [5].
 Sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution affected homing and foraging activity of honeybees.
 Bees fed with 500 or 1 000 ppb (parts per billion) of the insecticide in sucrose solutions failed to return to the hive and disappeared altogether, while bees that had imbibed 100 ppb solutions were delayed for 24 h compared with controls [6].
 Imidacloprid in sucrose solution fed to the bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours [7].
 Sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired [8].
 Bayer corporation scientists reported that neither honeybees exposed to imidacloprid in sunflower seeds dressed with the insecticide [9] nor maize seeds dressed with the insecticide or released from the seeds during planting [10] were detrimental to honeybees.
 The Bayer studies did not deal with sub-lethal behaviour of intoxicated bees.
 An independent study found that imidacloprid was released to the environment from treated maize seeds during seed planting [11].
 Bayer eco-toxicologists directed harsh criticisms at reports showing lethal or sub-lethal toxic effects of imidicloprid seed dressing and concluded that imidacloprid does not pose any significant risk to honeybees in the field [12], without, however, disproving the findings.
 It is simply yet another case of the anti-precaution principle being applied [13] (Use and Abuse of the Precautionary Principle, ISIS News 6) 6)
 Turning to GM crops such as maize, canola, cotton and soybean it is clear that all of these GM crops, with or without Bt genes, use seeds most of which are coated with neonicotinoid pesticides highly toxic to honey bees.
 For example, Herculex maize with Bt genes to control rootworm, like Yieldgard corn borer resistant maize, is planted with seeds dressed with a neonicotinoid insecticide and a fungicide.
 Furthermore, the GM planting requires setting aside plots of non-GM maize making up 20 percent of the planted area as a �refuge� to discourage the evolution of resistant insects.
 But the �refuge� is sprayed with neonicotinoid pesticide to protect its yield [14], and is more like a death camp for insects.
 Monsanto�s US Patent 6,660,690 provides for coating GM seeds with chemical pesticides [15].
 Toxicology known known
 The toxicology of neonicotinoid insecticides is well known.
 The insecticides are inhibitors of acetycholine receptors (i.e., they are nerve poisons).
 They have low toxicity for mammals, birds and fish, and are used to control fleas on dogs and cats [16].
 The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene family of the honeybee has been studied; it has 11 subunit members, a larger number than the fruit fly or mosquito.
 The genes for the subunits employ alternatively spliced transcripts to increase receptor diversity, and the messenger RNAs are edited to replace specific A bases with I bases.
 Information on the receptor should allow for development of insecticides that are not harmful to bees [17].
 In conclusion, the US NRC Committee did not deal with the heated debate over neonicotinoid pesticides and honeybee decline.
 Instead, that it seemed to suffer from tunnel vision and to be overcautious about matters that threaten large corporations.
 We urgently need a thoroughly independent committee to consider the full range of factors that may be contributing to the decline of bees, including pesticides, GM crops and electronic devices, before the bees become extinct.
 The purpose of this document is to provide information on how seed treatment products are currently regulated in Canada and the United States and to demonstrate the degree of regulatory harmonization of pesticides used for seed treatment in the two countries.
 The harmonization of registration data requirements and test protocols for these commodities between Canada and the United States are substantially in agreement.
 Consultation documents were published simultaneously August 30, 2000 by the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) as Regulatory Proposal PRO2000-05 and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.
 EPA) as OPP Docket #OP-00675.
 This Regulatory Directive has considered the comments received as a result of this consultation.

 1.0 Objective Objective
 The harmonization of pesticide regulatory requirements being carried out under the auspices of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Technical Working Group (TWG) on Pesticides is important for achieving the goal of one North American market for pesticides.
 This goal is articulated in the document known as the North American Initiative (NAI).
 The NAI commits Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) and the EPA to harmonize pesticide regulatory tools so that work sharing and joint review activities become routine.
 It is also an objective of the TWG to clearly communicate the status of the harmonization process.
 Regulatory Proposal, PRO2000-05, Harmonization of Regulation of Pesticide Seed Treatment in Canada and the United States, published in 2000, provided information on how seed treatment products are currently regulated in both Canada and the U.S.
 and reviewed the degree of regulatory harmonization of these commodities in the two countries.
 For the purposes of this document, seed treatments include products that are primarily intended to provide protection against soil fungi and insect damage.
 Seeds for propagation may be treated domestically or imported as treated seed, may be treated domestically for subsequent export, or may be planted to produce crop that is to be exported.
 2.0 Current legal framework in the United States States
 2.1 The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act Act
 Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), a pesticide generally must be registered with the EPA in order to be distributed, sold or imported into the U.S.
 To be registered, the EPA must determine that the pesticide will not pose unreasonable adverse effects to humans or the environment.
 The EPA has the authority, however, under FIFRA Sec.
 25(b) to exempt a pesticide from any provisions of FIFRA including registration, if the pesticide is "adequately regulated by another Federal agency" or "of a character that is unnecessary to be subject to [FIFRA] in order to carry out the purposes of the Act." Act."
 For the purposes of FIFRA, pesticide-treated seeds are considered to be pesticides themselves because they are a mixture of substances that are intended to prevent, destroy, repel or mitigate a pest.
 In 1988, the EPA promulgated regulation 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 152.25(a) exempting certain treated articles (including treated seeds) from regulation under FIFRA provided that both of the following conditions are met:
 a.the pesticide used for the treatment is registered for such use; and and
 b.the treatment is for the protection of the article or substance itself.
 In issuing this regulation, the EPA reasoned that the risks of treated seeds that meet the above criteria could adequately be regulated by means of registration of the treating pesticide.
 In evaluating the risks of the seed treatment, the EPA could also evaluate the risks from exposure to the seed treated according to the label instructions and forgo the need for a separate evaluation and registration of the treated seed.
 The term "registered for such use" in 40 CFR 152.25(a) refers to registration in the U.S.
 under FIFRA, and not to registration processes in other countries.
 Seeds treated in foreign countries are not eligible for the exemption unless they are treated with a pesticide also registered in the U.S.
 The term "for the protection of the [seed] itself" means that the pesticidal protection imparted to the treated seed does not extend beyond the seed itself to offer pesticidal benefits or value attributable to the treated seed.
 Unless claims of pesticidal benefit or value attributable to the treated seed and extending beyond the treated seed are made in conjunction with the distribution or sale of the treated seed within the U.S., the EPA will presume that the seed will have been treated "for the protection of the seed itself." The EPA does not regard a statement that seed has been treated (e.g., Seed has been treated with [a particular pesticide active ingredient] as a protectant) as a pesticidal claim that would negate the exemption outlined in 40 CFR 152.25(a).
 In general, seed treated with a pesticide that is to be sold or distributed in the U.S.
 must be coloured to prevent diversion for animal feed or other non-planting uses.
 EPA regulations in 40 CFR 153.155 require that a pesticide registered for treating seeds must contain a suitable dye unless the treatment is applied at planting (e.g., in the hopper box) for which dye is not necessary, or unless the pesticide label requires the user treating the seed to separately add a dye during the seed treatment process.
 Seeds for planting which are treated with pesticides registered in the U.S.
 are exempt from registration as pesticides, and may be freely distributed and sold within the U.S.
 sellers, distributors and importers of treated seeds should maintain sufficient documentation of the treatment to demonstrate that the treating pesticide is registered in the U.S.
 2.2 The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act Act
 Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) sec.
 408, the EPA evaluates the risks posed by pesticide residues in food and feed to a standard of "a reasonable certainty of no harm." Before registration, a pesticide tolerance (or exemption) must be established if the intended use of the pesticide may result or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in residues in a food crop.
 Treated seed for planting of food crops requires a tolerance unless it can be shown that residues are not carried forward to the crop grown from the seed.
 Generally, tolerances established as a result of the assessment of a foliar use for a particular crop are adequate to cover use as a seed treatment.
 Under the FFDCA, the Food and Drug Administration has established a policy with respect to the colouration of grain seeds to prevent the diversion into animal feed.
 Grain seed treated with pesticides for which there are no tolerances set or in excess of an established tolerance is required to be coloured or discoloured to avoid being considered adulterated.
 Although the policy applies only to certain grain seeds, it is widespread practice for other treated seed to be so coloured to indicate the presence of a pesticide.
 2.3 The Federal Seed Act Act
 The Federal Seed Act (FSA) and its regulations establish labelling requirements for seeds treated with toxic pesticides, both domestic and imported.
 Treated seeds must be labelled or tagged, or information concerning the treatment of bulk seed must be provided in invoices.
 In general, the following information is required:
 (1) a statement that seeds have been treated; (2) the common name of the treating pesticide; (3) a warning not to use for food, feed or oil purposes; and (4) if toxic, a skull and crossbones and the word Poison.
 The regulations outline exceptions and other provisions and should be consulted for complete information.

 3.0 Current legal framework in Canada Canada
 3.1 Pest Control Products Act Act
 In Canada, the PMRA administers the Pest Control Products Act (PCPA) which regulates all pest control products and requires those products subject to registration to be assessed as to their safety, merit and value.
 The PCPA exempts from registration seeds (including seed-like fruits, bulbs, corms and rootstock) that have been treated with pest control products under certain conditions specified in Schedule II of the regulations, as follows:
 a.the product used to treat seed is registered in Canada for that specific purpose; and and
 b.the seed is sold and shipped in bulk and shipping documents bear information setting forth the common name or chemical name of the active ingredient of the control product used to treat the seed; and and
 c.where the seed is packaged, the package bears a label with the words "This seed is treated with" followed by the name of the control product including the common name or chemical name of its active ingredient together with the appropriate precautionary symbols and signal words selected from Schedule III and such other statements as are required by these regulations and applicable to the control product used to treat the seed.
 In addition, Section 42 of the PCP Regulations requires that, "Where the physical properties of a control product are such that the presence of the control product may not be recognized when used and is likely to expose a person or domestic animal to a severe health risk, the control product shall be denatured by means of colour, odour, or such other means as the Minister may approve to provide a signal or warning as to its presence." presence."
 The PMRA has published Regulatory Directive DIR94-06 which gives specific instruction on expected colour standards and the labelling of treated seed.
 3.2 Food and Drugs Act Act
 In Canada, the Food and Drugs Act (FDA) prohibits the sale and distribution of contaminated and adulterated food.
 Regulations indicate when an adulterant is 'unacceptable', e.g., in the case of agricultural chemicals, whenever the residue exceeds the prescribed maximum residue limit (MRL).
 In the absence of a specific MRL for a pesticide, a maximum limit of 0.1 part per million is used, as per subsection B15.002(1) of the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations.
 The use of this provision of the FDA is currently under discussion in Canada.
 In the case of pesticide-treated seed, the seed is not considered a food (due to colouration, labelling and packaging which prevent its diversion to food); therefore, MRLs are not set for treated seeds.
 However, crops grown from treated seeds may potentially have a residue, and so there remains a need to evaluate potential residues as part of any risk assessment.
 3.3 Seeds Act Act
 The Seeds Act (SA) regulates all seeds, including those treated with pest control products.
 The SA defines seed as any plant part of any species belonging to the plant kingdom, represented, sold or used to grow a plant.
 Section 20 of the SA regulations requires that any seed treated with a pest control product "shall be thoroughly stained with a conspicuous colour to show that the seed has been so treated," unless the seed has been coated with any material that itself renders the seed conspicuous.
 Where seed has been treated with a pest control product, the precautionary symbol and signal word prescribed by the regulations made under the PCPA to indicate the degree and nature of risk inherent in that product, together with the following statement marked on the package of the seed or on a conspicuous label attached to the package, are required:
 "Do not use for food or feed.
 This seed has been treated with...
 (common or chemical name of pest control product)." product)."

 4.0 Comparison of U.S.
 and Canadian legal framework framework
 Both Canada and the U.S.
 require registration of seed treatment products used for domestic seed treatment.
 Both countries allow exemptions for imported pesticide-treated seeds providing the seed is treated with a pesticide registered in the host country for that specific purpose and where certain other conditions are met (e.g., compliance with colouration and labelling requirements).
 As summarized in the attached Appendix I which compares the legal framework in the U.S.
 and Canada, both countries have essentially similar legislation, regulatory frameworks, labelling, colouration and packaging requirements to mitigate risk associated with handling of the treated seed and to prevent its diversion to use as a food or feed.
 5.0 Comparison of U.S.
 and Canadian data requirements requirements
 The general data requirements for a new seed treatment formulated with an unregistered active ingredient are provided in the attached Appendix II.
 This table is a side-by-side comparison of requirements of the EPA Terrestrial Food Crop Use Group and the PMRA Use Site Category (USC) # 10, Seed Treatments, Food and Feed.
 It should be noted that, although the EPA categorizes seed treatments as a Terrestrial Food Crop, for the purposes of this table, the EPA has, where possible, evaluated those requirements as they apply to seed treatments only.
 The table demonstrates that U.S.
 and Canadian data requirements are essentially harmonized, although there remain some differences (see below).
 Many of the remaining differences are non data components.
 For example, the PMRA has included separate data code (DACO) numbers for data summaries, applicant addresses and other studies, data or reports which applicants may include as part of a scientific rationale or waiver request.
 Although the EPA has not published a requirement for these items, they are recognized as important and are provided by applicants.
 Remaining differences are not significant barriers to registration.
 Requirements for both the EPA and the PMRA of each of the major data categories are discussed below and any significant difference between the two agencies rationalized.
 The EPA and the PMRA are continuing to work to resolve outstanding differences.
 Where a foliar food use is also proposed or already registered for a particular active ingredient, the specific data requirements for a new seed treatment product are also briefly discussed.
 5.1 Product chemistry chemistry
 The PMRA and the EPA product chemistry requirements are essentially identical.
 With the exception of storage stability data, the properties listed as "R" (requirement) for the PMRA and "CR" (conditional requirement) for the EPA under 2.14 (technical grade of active ingredient [TGAI]) and 3.5 (end-use product [EP]) in Appendix II (e.g., properties such as pH, viscosity, flammability, corrosion characteristics) are equivalent.
 The PMRA requires that each DACO number for these properties be addressed either by the provision of data or a waiver request rationale.
 The basis for waiver requests (as per notes in the Regulatory Directives DIR98-03, Chemistry Requirements for the Registration of a Manufacturing Concentrate or an End-Use Product Formulated from Registered Technical Grade of Active Ingredients or Integrated System Products, and DIR98-04, Chemistry Requirements for the Registration of a Technical Grade of Active Ingredient or an Integrated System Product) are consistent with the EPA's proprietary conditions (as per 40 CFR 158.190 notes).
 5.2 Toxicology Toxicology
 Toxicology data requirements are essentially the same in Canada and the United States.
 Whereas microbial and mammalian point mutation studies are both required in the United States, Canada requires only one of these studies along with in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration genotoxicity studies.
 The U.S.
 requires a short-term neurotoxicity study while Canada only conditionally requires this study if there is potential for neurotoxicity.
 The PMRA would currently accept a seed-treatment product for review that meets EPA toxicology requirements.
 5.3 Exposure (occupational and bystander) bystander)
 Canada requires occupational exposure data.
 Options include passive dosimetry data, biological monitoring data or acceptable data from the Pesticide Handlers' Exposure Database (PHED).
 These data are only conditionally required by the EPA.
 5.4 Food and feed residue studies studies
 In the U.S., registration of a product as a seed treatment requires a tolerance unless it can be shown using a radio-labelled study that there is no residue uptake (<5 parts per billion (ppb)) in the plant grown from the treated seed.
 Consequently, Appendix II indicates a number of residue chemistry data requirements associated with the need to establish a tolerance, including multiresidue analytical methods, supervised residue trials, temporal residue data and analytical residue reference standards.
 If the required radio-labelled study indicated no uptake, no tolerance would be required and these data would not be required.
 Such data are only conditionally required in Canada.
 In Canada, if the results of three metabolism studies on dissimilar crops indicate a similar metabolic route in the three crops, then additional metabolism studies will not be required.
 When radio-labelled data for a crop grown from treated seed show no uptake of residues to the aerial portion and root portion of the crop (both human and livestock consumption), i.e., total radioactive residues (TRRs) in all plant tissues are less than 5 ppb, no further studies are required.
 However, the analytical methodology is always required (as per Appendix II).
 An MRL would then be established based on the analytical method's limit of quantitation (LOQ), provided that it is sufficiently low from an analytical chemistry standpoint and for risk assessment purposes.
 If TRRs are greater than 5 ppb, normal data requirements would apply.
 However, uses resulting in no quantifiable residues can be eligible for a reduction in the number of field trial data requirements if certain conditions are met (DIR98-02; Section 9.8)." 9.8)."
 5.5 Environmental fate and ecological effects effects
 The environmental data requirements are similar for both countries.
 Subsequent to the publishing of this document as a Regulatory Proposal, the PMRA now only requires terrestrial field dissipation studies for seed treatment on a case-by-case basis (i.e., conditionally) based on laboratory transformation, mobility, and toxicity data and the potential exposure.
 This is now harmonized with the U.S.
 EPA requirements.
 With respect to ecotoxicology, the EPA requires non-target plant data, while the PMRA does not for seed treatments.
 5.6 Value data data
 Applicants in both the United States and Canada must generate similar efficacy trials to support the claims of their products, however only the PMRA requires such data to be submitted.
 In the context of a joint review, the EPA will use the results of the PMRA efficacy review.
 5.7 Addition of a seed treatment use to an existing registration registration
 The data requirements discussed above represent the full data package for a seed treatment formulated with a new, unregistered active ingredient.
 Registration of a product for use as a seed treatment is frequently requested subsequent to or in addition to other proposed food uses and may therefore only require a reduced subset of the data outlined above.
 Many of the data requirements will have been satisfied where a seed treatment use is requested for a pesticide which is already registered as a foliar use on a particular crop.
 Addition of a seed treatment use to an existing foliar registration would require only data associated with registration of the specific end-use product intended for the seed treatment, typically product chemistry, acute toxicology, plant metabolism, analytical reference standards (U.S.
 only), efficacy (Canada only), environmental chemistry and fate.
 In both the U.S.
 and Canada, a tolerance for the foliar use will, in most cases, cover residues resulting from seed treatment; thus, additional data will not be needed to establish a tolerance.
 However, depending on the active ingredient and previously registered uses, data may be conditionally required in the U.S.
 and Canada for worker exposure, food residues, field dissipation and avian toxicity (see Appendix II).
 In conclusion, data outlined in Appendix II which has already been submitted and reviewed to support a foliar application of a particular active ingredient or end-use product to a food crop may be cited in support of an application for use of the same product as a seed treatment on that same crop.
 5.8 Seed treatment for export only market market
 In order to facilitate registration of seed treatment products for use on seed for export only, a reduced set of data requirements has been identified in Appendix II.
 In Canada, DACOs identified with the symbol NX would not be required if the end-use seed treatment product was for use on seed for export only.
 Top of Page Page
 6.0 Programs to facilitate registration of seed treatment products products
 The PMRA has several programs which may facilitate registration of active ingredients, seed treatment end-use products and seed treatment uses.
 The User Requested Minor Use Registration (URMUR) program encourages sponsor/user groups, in cooperation with registrants, to apply for the registration of products containing active ingredients which have been recently registered (i.e., within the last 5 years) in the United States or other OECD countries.
 The PMRA ensures that by making use of acceptable foreign reviews completed by other countries that the procedures for the technical review of URMUR applications are as efficient as possible.
 The User Requested Minor Use Label Expansion (URMULE) program considers the registration of a new minor use of a pesticide for which the active ingredient(s) and the end-use product are currently registered in Canada (see DIR2001-01).
 Many seed treatment uses may be considered minor uses.
 The PMRA and the U.S.
 EPA, in cooperation with Mexico's CICOPLAFEST, have established a process for the joint review of pest control products that contain conventional chemical pesticides, and for the joint review of pest control products in which the new active ingredient is a microbial or an arthropod semiochemical (including pheromones).
 Joint reviews, which offer applicants reduced timelines for review, increase the efficiency of the registration process, facilitate simultaneous registration in participating countries and increase access to new pest management tools in participating countries.
 Joint review is a process which both Agencies strongly encourage registrants to pursue.
 Pre-submission consultations are required in the joint review process to establish case-specific data requirements (including possible data waivers) and differences resolved or justified prior to a submission being made.
 Typically, minor differences in data requirements for seed treatment products are resolvable through a pre-submission consultation either in the context of an independent application to the PMRA or in a joint review submission.
 Reduced-risk pesticides pesticides
 In May 2002, the PMRA introduced an initiative whereby the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Joint Review Programs for Reduced-Risk Pesticides will be extended by the PMRA to include submissions made to the PMRA only.
 The program is designed to encourage pesticide manufacturers to apply for Canadian registration of reduced-risk products that are currently available in the United States (U.S.); Canada will use the same criteria as the U.S.
 EPA to determine eligibility of chemicals for the reduced-risk program and recognize the U.S.
 EPA's biopesticide designation, thus further harmonizing the respective approaches of the two countries.
 Through this program, the PMRA will also commit to shorter review timelines for products that have been shown to qualify as reduced-risk chemicals or biopesticides.
 Refer to Regulatory Directive DIR2002-02 The PMRA Initiative for Reduced-Risk Pesticides for more details and guidance on preparation of submissions to the PMRA.
 7.0 Conclusions Conclusions
 The legal framework for the registration of seed treatment products in Canada and the U.S.
 are essentially harmonized.
 Although data requirements are not identical, they are essentially harmonized in most areas, and the EPA and the PMRA continue to work to resolve differences.
 Trade irritants are most frequently the result of dissimilar registrations in the two countries.
 Commodity grower groups and users are encouraged to work with pesticide registrants to ensure that full use is made of existing joint review and work sharing mechanisms between the two agencies, as well as other regulatory streams which can facilitate registration (e.g., minor use programs).

 FREIBURG, Germany, August 25, 2008 (ENS) - The German organization Coalition against Bayer Dangers today brought legal action against Werner Wenning, chairman of the Bayer AG Board of Management, by filing a charge against him with the public prosecutor in Freiburg.
 The group accuses Bayer CropScience of "marketing dangerous pesticides and thereby accepting the mass death of bees all over the world." world."
 Werner Wenning has chaired the Bayer AG Board of Management since 2002.
 (Photo courtesy Bayer AG) AG)
 The coalition filed the charge in cooperation with German beekeepers who claim they lost thousands of hives after poisoning by the Bayer pesticide clothianidin in May.
 Since 1991, Bayer has been producing the insecticide imidacloprid, which is one of the best selling insecticides in the world, often used as seed-dressing for maize, sunflower, and rape.
 Bayer exports imidacloprid to more than 120 countries and the substance is Bayer's best-selling pesticide.
 Since patent protection for imidacloprid has expired in most countries, Bayer in 2003 brought a similarly functionning successor product, clothianidin, onto the market, the coalition alleges.
 Both substances are systemic chemicals that work their way from the seed through the plant.
 The substances get into the pollen and the nectar and can damage beneficial insects such as bees.
 The coalition alleges that the start of sales of imidacloprid and clothianidin coincided with the occurrence of large scale bee deaths in many European and American countries.
 Up to 70 percent of all hives have been affected.
 In France, approximately 90 billion bees died over the past 10 years, reducing honey production by up to 60 percent.
 Attorney Harro Schultze, who represents the Coalition against Bayer Dangers said, "The public prosecutor needs to clarify which efforts Bayer undertook to prevent a ban of imidacloprid and clothianidin after sales of both substances were stopped in France.
 We're suspecting that Bayer submitted flawed studies to play down the risks of pesticide residues in treated plants." plants."
 In France, imidacloprid has been banned as a seed dressing for sunflowers since 1999 and in 2003 was also banned as a sweet corn treatment.
 Convened by the French government, in 2003 the Comit?
 Scientifique et Technique declared that the treatment of seeds with imidacloprid leads to significant risks for bees.
 Bayer's application for approval of clothianidin was also rejected by French authorities.

 Clothianidin and imidacloprid are two of a relatively new class of insecticides known as neonicotinoids that impact the central nervous system of insects.
 "Bayer's Board of Management has to be called to account since the risks of neonicotinoids such as imidacloprid and clothianidin have now been known for more than 10 years," says Philipp Mimkes, spokesman for the Coalition Against Bayer-Dangers.
 The coalition is demanding that Bayer withdraw all neonicotinoids from the market worldwide.
 "With an annual turnover of nearly 800 million euro, neonicotinoids are among Bayer's most important products," said Mimkes.
 "This is the reason why Bayer, despite serious environmental damage, is fighting against any application prohibitions." prohibitions."
 The accusation of flawed studies is echoed by the Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency which said of Bayer's clothianidin application, "All of the field/semi-field studies, however, were found to be deficient in design and conduct of the studies and were, therefore, considered as supplemental information only.
 "Clothianidin may pose a risk to honey bees and other pollinators, if exposure occurs via pollen and nectar of crop plants grown from treated seeds," said the Canadian agency.
 The agency said, "It should also be noted that clothianidin is very persistent in soil, with high carry-over of residues to the next growing season.
 clothianidin is also mobile in soil." soil."
 Germany banned neonicotinoids for seed treatment in May 2008, due to negative affects on bee colonies.
 Beekeepers in the Baden-W?rttemberg region suffered a severe decline linked to the use of clothianidin.
 The German Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety suspended the registration for eight pesticide seed treatment products on maize and rapeseed, including clothianidin and imidacloprid.
 Bayer says the pesticide entered the environment because farmers failed to apply an adhesive agent that affixes the compound to the seed coats.
 Without the fixative agent, Bayer says, the compound drifted into the environment from sown rapeseed and sweet corn and then affected the honeybees.
 "Seed treatments are one of the most targeted and environmentally friendly forms to apply crop protection products.
 We regret the recent bee losses and the situation they have created for the beekeepers in Baden-W?rttemberg," said Dr.
 Hans-Josef Diehl, head of development and registration at Bayer CropScience Deutschland GmbH during an expert hearing on bee losses in Karlsruhe, Germany in June.
 Dr.
 Richard Schmuck, an ecologist at Bayer CropScience, said in June, "All studies available to us confirm that our product is safe to bees if the recommended dressing quality is maintained.
 This is also shown by the product safety assessments which we have submitted to the registration authorities." authorities."
 "When used correctly," he said, "this crop protection product is safe for operators, consumers and the environment and fulfills the international criteria with regard to ecological systems." systems."
 In the United States, the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council filed a lawsuit August 15 in federal court in Washington, DC to force the federal government to disclose studies it ordered on the effect of clothianidin on honey bees.
 Studies on clothianidin were ordered by the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency from Bayer CropScience in 2003 when the EPA granted the company a registration for the chemical.
 NRDC attorneys believe that the EPA has evidence of connections between pesticides and the mysterious honey bee die-offs reported across the country called colony collapse disorder that it has not made public.
 Colony collapse disorder has claimed more than one-third of honey bees in the United States since it was first identified in 2006.
 Residues of chemical substances contained in pesticides (plant protection products) have been found in streams in four agricultural areas in Sweden despite no reported direct use.
 This report investigated whether these residues originated from seed dressing preparations used in the areas or some other source.
 Nine substances, two insecticides and seven fungicides included in the Swedish Pesticide Monitoring Programme, were investigated.
 Time-proportional water samples were collected from the streams in the four areas during 2002-2006.
 Mainly pesticides used within agriculture (plant protection products) were analysed.
 Data on the water samples together with information on crops, sowing dates and use of pesticides etc.
 obtained from the farmers in the four monitoring areas were analysed.
 Interviews with farmers about handling of treated seed and a field experiment were carried out in order to investigate potential transport pathways of seed dressing preparations into the environment.
 In the field experiment, a test plot in southern Sweden equipped with artificial drainage was sown with treated rape seed.
 Substance concentrations reported in the database are low, and only two substances (betacyfluthrin and bitertanol) have been detected above the Swedish guideline value for sur-face water, on one occasion each.
 However, analysis of the database showed that two of the substances detected, metalaxyl and bitertanol, could be linked to sowing treated seed of a specific crop, processing peas and winter wheat respectively.
 The interview responses indicated that handling of treated seed was not the source of the residues detected in the four streams.
 However, washing of seed drills could be an exception and is a poten-tial source worth further investigation.
 None of the farmers interviewed had considered seed dressing preparations as a potential source of environmental contamination.
 In the field experiment, two of the substances present in the rape seed dressing preparation were detected in water samples about two weeks after sowing, confirming that seed dressing preparations can leach from the soil.
 The conclusion is that some of the chemical residues detected in streams can be linked to seed dressing preparations.
 For other substances, point sources from some other use are the most likely cause, while for yet others, both are possible sources.

 Describes procedures that can be used by national authorities to predict the dietary intake of pesticide residues and thus reach conclusions concerning the acceptability of Codex Maximum Residue Limits from a public health point of view.
 Prepared in collaboration with the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues, the guidelines respond to the need for a method of reaching reasonable assurance that the intakes of pesticide residues for different populations do not exceed safety limits.
 The book opens with background information on methods used to establish acceptable daily intake and maximum residue limits for pesticides.
 Methods for predicting the dietary intake of pesticide residues are then introduced in terms of general considerations, indices of residue levels, and indices of food consumption, including those appropriate for use in predicting intake at international and national levels.
 Now in its second edition, the book reflects several improvements in methods for estimating levels of residues in food.
 Readers are given details for calculating intake levels using theoretical maximum daily intake, estimated maximum daily intake, and estimated daily intake.
 To illustrate the use of these guidelines, the book features sample calculations of theoretical maximum daily intake and international estimated daily intake values as well as estimates of exposure performed at the national level.
 The book concludes with a glossary of key terms and a series of notes on the correct use of the guidelines.
 Annex 1:
 Acceptable daily intakes, short-term dietary intakes, acute references doses, recommended maximum residue levels and supervised trials median residue values recorded by the 2005 Meeting Meeting
 The following extracts of the results of the annual Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) are provided to make them accessible to interested parties at an early date.
 The Meeting evaluated 21 pesticides, of which five were new compounds, and eight were re-evaluated within the periodic review programme of the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues (CCPR).
 The Meeting established acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) and acute reference doses (ARfDs).
 The Meeting estimated maximum residue levels, which it recommended for use as maximum residue limits (MRLs) by the CCPR.
 It also estimated supervised trials median residue (STMR) and highest residue (HR) levels as a basis for estimation of the dietary intake of residues of the pesticides reviewed.
 Application of HR levels is explained in the report of the 1999 Meeting (section 2.4).
 The allocations and estimates are shown in the table.
 Pesticides for which the estimated dietary intakes might, on the basis of the available information, exceed their ADIs are marked with footnotes, as explained in detail in the report of the 1999 Meeting (section 2.2).
 Footnotes are also applied to specific commodities when the available information indicated that the ARfD of a pesticide might be exceeded when the commodity was consumed.
 It should be noted that these distinctions apply only to new compounds and those re-evaluated within the CCPR periodic review programme.
 The table includes the Codex reference numbers of the compounds and the Codex classification numbers (CCNs) of the commodities, to facilitate reference to the Codex maximum limits for pesticide residues (Codex Alimentarius, Vol.
 2B) and other documents and working documents of the Codex Alimentarius Commission.
 Both compounds and commodities are listed in alphabetical order.
 Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) (ADI)
 "ADI" of a chemical is the daily intake which, during an entire lifetime, appears to be without appreciable risk to the health of the consumer on the basis of all the known facts at the time of the evaluation of the chemical by the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues.
 It is expressed in milligrams of the chemical per kilogram of body weight.
 (Note:
 For additional information on ADIs relative to pesticide residues refer to the Report of the 1975 Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues, FAO Plant Production and Protection Series No.1 or WHO Technical Report Series No.
 592).
 Extraneous Maximum Residue Limit (EMRL) (EMRL)
 "EMRL" refers to a pesticide residue or a contaminant arising from environmental sources (including former agricultural uses) other than the use of a pesticide or contaminant substance directly or indirectly on the commodity.
 It is the maximum concentration of a pesticide residue or contaminant that is recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission to be legally permitted or recognized as acceptable in or on a food, agricultural commodity, or animal feed.
 The concentration is expressed in milligrams of pesticide residue or contaminant per kilogram of the commodity.
 Good Agricultural Practice in the Use of Pesticides (GAP) (GAP)
 "GAP" includes the nationally authorised safe uses of pesticides under actual conditions necessary for effective and reliable pest control.
 It encompasses a range of levels of pesticide applications up to the highest authorised use, applied in a manner which leaves a residue which is the smallest amount practicable.
 Authorised safe uses are determined at the national level and include nationally registered or recommended uses, which take into account public and occupational health and environmental safety considerations.
 Actual conditions include any stage in the production, storage, transport, distribution and processing of food commodities and animal feed.
 Limit of Determination Determination
 "Limit of determination" is the lowest concentration of a pesticide residue or contaminant that can be identified and quantitatively measured in a specified food, agricultural commodity, or animal feed with an acceptable degree of certainty by a regulatory method of analysis.
 Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) (MRL)
 "MRL" is the maximum concentration of a pesticide residue (expressed as mg/kg), recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission to be legally permitted in or in food commodities and animal feeds.
 MRLs are based on GAP data and foods derived from commodities that comply with the respective MRLs are intended to be toxicologically acceptable.
 Codex MRLs which are primarily intended to apply in international trade, are derived from estimations made by the JMPR following:
 a) toxicological assessment of the pesticide and its residue; and and
 b) review of residue data from supervised trials and supervised uses including those reflecting national food agricultural practices.
 Data from supervised trials conducted at the highest nationally recommended, authorised or registered uses are included in the review.
 In order to accommodate variations in national pest control requirements, Codex MRLs take into account the higher levels shown to arise in such supervised trials, which are considered to represent effective pest control practices.
 Consideration of the various dietary residue estimates and determinations both at the national and international level in comparison with the ADI, should indicate that foods complying with Codex MRLs are safe for human consumption.
 Pesticide Pesticide
 "Pesticide" means any substance intended for preventing, destroying, attracting, repelling, or controlling any pest including unwanted species of plants or animals during the production, storage, transport, distribution, and processing of food, agricultural commodities, or animal feeds or which may be administered to animals for the control of ectoparasites.
 The term includes substances intended for use as a plant-growth regulator, defoliant, desiccant, fruit thinning agent, or sprouting inhibitor and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport.
 The term normally excludes fertilizers, plant and animal nutrients, food additives and animal drugs.
 (Note:
 "Agricultural commodities" refers to commodities such as raw cereals, sugar beet, and cottonseed which might not, in the general sense, be considered food).
 Pesticide Residue Residue
 "Pesticide residue" means any specified substances in food, agricultural commodities, or animal feed resulting from the use of a pesticide.
 The term includes any derivatives of a pesticide, such as conversion products, metabolites, reaction products, and impurities considered to be of toxicological significance.
 (Note:
 The term "pesticide residue" includes residues from unknown or unavoidable sources (e.g., environmental), as well as known uses of the chemical).
 Provisional Tolerable daily Intake (PTDI) (PTDI)
 A value based on toxicological data.
 It represents tolerable human intake of a former agricultural pesticide that may occur as a contaminant in food, drinking water and the environment.
 (Report of 1995 JMPR, FAO Plant Production and Protection Paper 127, p.
 5) 5)
 Temporary Acceptable Daily Intake Intake
 "Temporary ADI" is an acceptable daily intake established for a specified, limited period to enable additional biochemical, toxicological or other data to be obtained as may be required for estimating an acceptable daily intake.
 (Note:
 A TADI estimated by the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues normally involves the application of a safety factor larger than that used in estimating an ADI).
 Possible modifying effects of pesticide mixtures on tumorigenesis were investigated with medium-term carcinogenesis protocols for rapid detection of carcinogenic agents using male F344 rats.
 In the 8-wk liver model, administration of 20 pesticides (19 organophosphorus compounds and one organochlorine), added to the diet each at acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels, did not enhance rat liver preneoplastic lesion development initiated by diethylnitrosamine.
 In contrast, a mixture of these 20 pesticides at 100 times the ADI significantly increased the number and area of liver lesions.
 In the second experiment using a multi-organ carcinogenicity protocol of 28 wk, mixtures of 40 pesticides (high production examples) or 20 pesticides (suspected carcinogens) added to the diet at their respective ADI levels did not modulate carcinogenesis in any organ initiated by five known potent carcinogens in combination.
 These results thus provide direct support for the safety factor (usually 100) approach using ADI values for the quantitative risk evaluation of pesticides.
 Acceptable daily intake or ADI is a measure of the amount of a specific substance (originally applied for a food additive, later also for a residue of a veterinary drug or pesticide) in food or drinking water that can be ingested (orally) on a daily basis over a lifetime without an appreciable health risk. 
ADIs are expressed usually in milligrams (of the substance) per kilograms of body weight per day.

 5 Notes Notes
  HistoryThis concept was first introduced in 1961 by the Council of Europe and later the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), a committee maintained by two United Nations bodies:
 the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO and the WHO World Health Organization.[2] Organization.[2]
  ConceptAn ADI value is based on current research, with long-term studies on animals and observations of humans.
 First, a No Observable (Adverse) Effect Level,[3][4] the amount of a substance that shows no toxic effects, is determined.
 Usually the studies are performed with several doses including high doses.
 In the case of several studies on different effects, the lowest NO(A)EL is usually taken.
 Then, the NOEL (or NOAEL) is divided by a safety factor, conventionally 100, to account for the differences between test animals and humans (factor of 10) and possible differences in sensitivity between humans (another factor of 10).[3] The ADI is usually given in mg per kg body weight per day.[5] day.[5]
 The ADI is considered a safe intake level for a healthy adult of normal weight who consumes an average daily amount of the substance in question.
 Increased safety factors for infants have been discussed, but are not needed, because elimination of chemicals is in fact often more rapid in children.[6] The ADI does not take into account allergic reactions that are individual responses rather than dose-dependent phenomena.
 The higher the ADI, the larger amounts of a compound are safe for regular ingestion.
 The concept of tolerable daily intake is often used for unwanted contaminants or other chemicals.
 The ADI concept can be understood as a measure to indicate the toxicity from long-term exposure to repeated ingestion of chemical compounds in foods (present and/or added), as opposed to acute toxicity.
 Active ingredient:
 Synonym for active substance.
 Active substance:
 Any substance or micro-organism, including a virus, that has a general or specific action:
 against harmful organisms; or on plants, parts of plants or plant products.
 Active substances are usually formulated with other materials in a pesticide product.
 Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI):
 The acceptable daily intake is the amount of a substance which can be ingested every day of an individual's entire lifetime, in the practical certainty, on the basis of all known facts, that no harm will result.
 The ADI is expressed as milligrams (mg) of chemical per kg body weight of the consumer.
 The ADI is derived from the most appropriate NOAEL (qv) by applying an assessment factor normally 100.
 Acute Reference Dose (ARfD):
 This is intended to define (on the basis of all known facts at the time of the evaluation) an estimate of a chemical substance in food (or drinking water), expressed on a bodyweight basis, that can be ingested over a short period of time, usually during one meal or one day, without appreciable health risk to the consumer.
 Analyte:
 The name of the substance looked for and measured, if present.
 It might be a pesticide itself or a product from the pesticide as a result of degradation or metabolism.
 Codex Alimentarius:
 Codex Alimentarius is a series of food standards and related texts that aim to provide a high level of consumer protection and fair practice in the trade of food and agricultural products.
 Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC):
 The organisation charged with the development of the Codex standards and texts.
 The Codex Alimentarius Commission is an intergovernmental body jointly sponsored by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the World Health Organisation (WHO).
 Membership is open to all Member Nations and Associate Members of the FAO and WHO and currently consists of over 160 countries.
 Good agricultural practice in the use of pesticides (GAP):
 The nationally authorised safe uses of pesticides under conditions necessary for effective and reliable pest control i.e.
 the way products should be used according to the statutory conditions of approval which are stated on the label.
 GAP encompasses a range of pesticide applications up to the highest authorised rates of use, applied in a manner which leaves a residue which is the smallest practicable.
 Authorised safe uses are determined at national level and include nationally registered recommended uses, which take into account public and occupational health and environmental safety considerations.
 Actual conditions include any stage in the production, storage, transport, distribution and processing of food commodities and animal feed.
 Good Laboratory Practice (GLP):
 GLP is the organisational process and the conditions under which studies are planned, performed, monitored, recorded and reported.
 GLP ensures that the way the work is done is adequately standardised and of a sufficiently high quality to produce reliable results which can with confidence be compared with those of others carrying out the same work and applying the same general principles.
 Limit of determination (LOD):
 The limit of determination is the lowest concentration of a pesticide or contaminant that can be routinely identified and quantitatively measured in a specified food, agricultural commodity or animal feed with an acceptable degree of certainty by the method of analysis.
 Also known as the Limit of Quantification (LOQ).
 Maximum residue level (MRL):
 The maximum concentration of a pesticide residue (expressed as mg/kg) legally permitted in or on food commodities and animal feeds.
 MRLs are based on good agricultural practice data and residues in foods derived from commodities that comply with the respective MRLs are intended to be toxicologically acceptable.
 MRLs are not in themselves �safety limits�.
 MRLs are intended primarily as a check that GAP is being followed and to assist international trade in produce treated with pesticides.
 MRLs are not safety limits, and exposure to residues in excess of an MRL does not automatically imply a hazard to health.
 For some pesticides and commodities insufficient trials data are available on which to set an MRL.
 In these cases the MRL may be set at a default level i.e.
 the LOD.
 These MRLs are not based on GAP.
 Codex or CAC MRLs:
 In cases where there is no UK or EC MRLs, the acceptability of residues may be judged against Codex Maximum Residue Limits.
 Although not embodied in UK statute, Codex limits are taken as presumptive standards.
 These limits give an indication of the likely highest residue that should occur in edible crops.
 These are based on worldwide uses, at the time of evaluation (date of setting the limits is specified and thus Maximum Residue Limit applicable up to that year, but will not take into account subsequent approved uses.) uses.)
 It should be noted that there are occasions where the MRL that has been set may not reflect UK Good Agricultural Practice (e.g.
 the Codex MRLs for dithiocarbamates and propamocarb on lettuce).
 In such circumstances it is possible to exceed the Codex MRL through a UK approved use.
 MRL exceedance:
 When a residue is found at a level higher than that set for the MRL.
 Metabolite:
 A degradation or conversion product from a pesticide when it is metabolised.
 No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL):
 The highest exposure level in a toxicity study at which there are no statistically significant and/or biologically significant increases in the frequency of adverse effects between the group of animals exposed to the test substance and its respective control group.
 Pesticide:
 A pesticide is any substance, preparation or organism prepared or used for destroying any pest.
 Pesticide Residues Committee (PRC):
 The Pesticide Residues Committee is an independent Non-Departmental Public Body.
 The Committee is made up of some members with a technical background (e.g.
 food safety/toxicological risk assessment), some with experience in the horticulture industry, and some with consumer/lay interests.
 The PRC is responsible for overseeing the Government's monitoring programme for pesticide residues.
 The PRC replaced The Working Party on Pesticides Residues (WPPR).
 Risk Assessment:
 A risk assessment is carried out when residues are found in foods to determine whether, at the levels found, they present a concern for consumer health or not.
 Approval of a pesticide is only recommended when the consumer risk is acceptable.
 Consumer risk assessments are carried out for both short term (peak) and long term intakes.
 These assessments use information on food consumption, collected in dietary surveys, in conjunction with the residue level found.
 Estimated intake for different consumer groups is then compared to the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) and to the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) set for the pesticide.
 Reporting Limit:
 The lowest calibrated level employed during analysis to detect residues.
 Residue:
 Residues may be present in vegetable and animal products following the application(s) of a pesticide(s).
 They may not only include the pesticide that was applied but other degradation or reaction products and metabolites that may be of toxicological significance.
 The levels or amounts of residues present are expressed in milligrams of the chemical in a kilogram of crop/food/commodity (mg/kg), or parts per million.
 The Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) - National Reference Laboratory for Pesticides.
 Pesticide residue levels in foodstuffs are generally regulated in order to:
 �Minimise the exposure of consumers to the harmful intake of pesticides pesticides
 �Control the correct use of pesticides in terms of the authorisations or registrations granted (application rates and pre-harvest intervals) intervals)
 �Permit the free circulation within the EU of products treated with pesticides as long as they comply with the harmonised MRLs.
 A maximum residue level (MRL) for pesticide residues is the maximum concentration of a pesticide residue (expressed in mg/kg) legally permitted in or on food commodities and animal feed.
 MRLs are based on Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) data.
 Foods derived from commodities that comply with the respective MRLs are intended to be toxicologically acceptable.
 Exceeded MRLs are indicators of violations of GAP.
 If MRLs are exceeded, comparison of the exposure with acceptable daily intake (ADI) and/or acute reference dose (acute RfD) will then indicate whether, or not, there are possible chronic or acute health risks, respectively.
 The acceptable daily intake (ADI) is the estimate of the amount of a substance of food, expressed on a body-weight basis, that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk to the consumer.
 The ADI is based on the no observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) in animal testing.
 A safety factor, that takes into consideration the type of effect, the severity or reversibility of the effect, and the inter- and intra-species variability, is applied to the NOAEL.
 The ADI therefore reflects chronic (long-term) toxicity.
 The acute Reference Dose (ArfD) is the estimate of the amount of a substance in food, expressed on a body-weight basis, that can be ingested over a short period of time, usually during one meal or one day, without appreciable health risk to the consumer.
 It therefore reflects acute (short-term) toxicity.
 At present, acute Reference Doses have been fixed for a number of pesticides.
 Legislation and reference sources sources
 From 2nd September 2008, all pesticides will have MRLs set under a new Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 (and its amending acts).
 Default level and exceptions to the levels levels
 The maximum pesticide residue level in foodstuffs is 0.01 mg/kg.
 This general level is applicable 'by default', i.e.
 in all cases where an MRL has not been specifically set for a product or product type.
 Different default values maybe fixed taking into account the routine analytical methods available.
 Such default values will be listed in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, but this is yet to be published.
 Setting, amending and removing MRLs MRLs
 For a plant protection product to be placed on the market pursuant to Directive 91/414/EEC, the active substances which it contains should be assessed in order to determine the threshold above which their concentration in food products presents a risk for humans and animals.
 The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will be responsible for risk evaluation.
 It will make a decision on each intended new MRL, amendment or removal (except in the case of removals resulting from an authorisation of a plant protection product being revoked).
 The EFSA will issue an opinion including the anticipated limit of determination * for the pesticide/commodity combination, and a risk assessment for cases where the admissible daily intake is exceeded.
 Based on the EFSA's opinion, the Commission will issue a Regulation to establish a new MRL or to amend or remove an existing MRL.
 Sampling methods methods
 Community methods of sampling for the official control of pesticide residues in and on products of plant and animal origin are laid down in Commission Directive 2002/63/EC.
 Analytical methods methods
 Appropriate analytical methods may be obtained from the Community Reference Laboratories for Residues of Pesticides (CRL) data pool, though registration is first necessary.

 DDT was the first synthetic pesticide of the modern age.
 It promised much, but ultimately created widespread concern as an environmental hazard.
 What is DDT?
 Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is a organochlorine contact insecticide that kills by acting as a nerve poison.
 Its insecticidal properties were discovered by the Swiss scientist Paul M�ller working for J.R.
 Geigy (now Novartis) in 1942(1).
 Exactly how DDT affects the nervous system is not properly understood, although a great deal of work has been done to try and find out its precise mode of action(2).
 This fact sheet will refer to the technical product 'DDT' which is a mixture of isomers, principally p,p'-DDT, with lesser amounts of o,p'-DDT (isomers are chemicals with the same molecular make-up, but with differing three-dimensional structure).
 Small amounts of the breakdown products DDD and DDE can also be found in the formulation.
 DDT was originally used during World War II to control typhus which was spread by the body louse.
 Since then it has been used to control mosquito borne malaria, and was used extensively as a general agricultural insecticide.
 Initially DDT was spectacularly successful particularly in the control of malaria, as well as against agricultural pests.
 But by the 1950s, resistance problems had developed, and during the 1960s, a number of serious environmental problems were identified leading to wide-ranging restrictions on its use (see below)(3).
 In recent years numerous studies on DDT have shown its environmental persistence and its ability to bioaccumulate, especially in higher animals.
 Of particular concern is its potential to mimic hormones and thereby disrupt endocrine systems in wildlife and possibly humans.
 Production Production
 Many pesticide companies have been involved with DDT production.
 By 1991, only Enichem Synthesis (Italy), Hindustan Insecticides (India) and P.T Montrose Pesticido Nusantara (Indonesia) were listed by UN Environment Programme (UNEP) as basic producers(4).
 It is also produced in Mexico(5).
 There is no continuous record of world production of DDT, and estimates of usage vary.
 UNEP suggested that world consumption between 1971 and 1981 was 68,800 tonnes per year(60.
 Today, most uses involve public health vector control (see also table 1), and the most recent figures suggest production for 1990 was 2,800 tonnes(7).
 In the US, annual usage reached a peak of 35,771 tonnes in 1959, that then declined to 13,724 tonnes in 1969.
 Because of exports, production continued to grow until 1963 (81,154 tonnes), and then this too gradually decreased(8).
 From 1950 to 1970, more than 20,000 tonnes of DDT were used annually in the Soviet Union (former USSR)(9).

 Acute toxicity toxicity
 DDT is moderately to slightly toxic to mammals.
 The acute oral LD50 ranges from 113-118 mg/kg in rats; 150-300 mg/kg in mice; 300 mg/kg in rabbits; 500-750 mg/kg in dogs; and >1,000 mg/kg in sheep and goats.
 DDT is less toxic to test animals exposed via the skin.
 The acute dermal LD50 for female rats is 2,510 mg/kg(10).
 DDT is categorised by the World Health Organisation as Class II "moderately hazardous"(11).
 It mainly affects the central and peripheral nervous systems, and the liver.
 Acute effects in humans exposed to low to moderate levels may include nausea, diarrhoea, increased liver enzyme activity, irritation of the eyes, nose and/or throat.
 At higher doses, tremors and convulsions are possible(12).
 Deaths from exposure to DDT are rare.
 Even in developing countries there have been few reported cases, especially when compared with organophosphate insecticides (see PN34 pp20-21).
 In 1994, one fatal poisoning was reported in the US involving a child who ingested one ounce (28g) of a 5% DDT and kerosene solution(13).
 Chronic effects effects
 DDT has caused chronic effects on the nervous system, liver, kidneys, and immune systems in experimental animals.
 Dose levels at which effects were observed are at very much higher levels than those which may be typically encountered in humans(14).
 However they may be at, or even below, levels found in body fat (see below).
 Reproductive effects effects
 DDT causes adverse reproductive effects in test animals.
 In one rat study, oral doses of 7.5 mg/kg/day for 36 weeks resulted in sterility.
 In rabbits, doses of 1 mg/kg/day administered on gestation days 4-7 resulted in decreased foetal weights.
 In mice, doses of 1.67 mg/kg/day resulted in decreased embryo implantation and irregularities in the oestrus cycle over 28 weeks(15).
 Many of these observations may be the result of disruptions to the endocrine (hormonal) system.
 Available epidemiological studies involving exposure to DDT have not confirmed adverse effects in humans.
 One study did report a significant association between maternal DDT blood levels and miscarriage, but the presence of other organochlorines in maternal blood, make it difficult to attribute the effect solely to DDT(16).
 Teratogenic effects (birth defects) defects)
 Again there is evidence that DDT causes teratogenic effects in test animals.
 In mice, maternal doses of 26 mg/kg/day DDT from gestation through to lactation resulted in impaired learning in maze tests(17).
 Epidemiological studies involving humans are unavailable(18).
 Cancer Cancer
 The evidence relating to DDT and carcinogenicity provides uncertain conclusions.
 It has increased tumour production, mainly in the liver and lungs, in test animals such as rats, mice and hamsters in some studies, but not in others.
 In rats, liver tumours were induced in three studies at doses of 12.5 mg/kg/day over periods of 78 weeks to life, and thyroid tumours were induced at doses of 85 mg/kg/day over 78 weeks.
 Tests have shown laboratory mice were more sensitive to DDT.
 Life time doses of 0.4 mg/kg/day resulted in lung tumours in the second generation and leukaemia in the third generation, and liver tumours were induced at oral doses of 0.26 mg/kg/day in two separate studies over several generations(19).
 The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has determined that 'DDT may reasonably be anticipated to be a human carcinogen'.
 DHHS has not classified DDE and DDD, but the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that they are probable human carcinogens(20).
 Work carried out by the US National Cancer Institute correlates breast cancer in women with increased levels of DDE in blood serum.
 From 14,290 women monitored in the New York University Women's Health Study, researchers selected 58 women who had developed breast cancer and 171 matched controls without cancer.
 After adjusting for participants' childbearing and breast feeding histories, and for family history of breast cancer, researchers found a four-fold increase in relative risk of breast cancer for women with elevated levels of DDE in the blood(21).
 Residues in food food
 DDT is very fat-soluble and is therefore found in fatty foods such as meat and diary products.
 Even in countries across North America and Northern Europe, where its use has been banned for over a decade (see restrictions) DDT residues are still often found in food.
 This is because of environmental persistence, illegal use, or importation of contaminated food from regions where DDT is still used.
 A range of analysis has been carried out in the UK, which is indicative of levels in the region.
 During 1996, the UK Working Party of Pesticide Residues (WPPR) found residues of DDT in butter, milk, eggs, lamb, potatoes, deep water fish and shell fish(22).
 The WPPR is trying to establish whether residues have originated from recent illegal use, or historical contamination.
 In a survey of non-indigenous deep water fish and shell fish, low levels of DDT residues and metabolites were found in 16 (50%) of the deep water samples and three (19%) of the 16 shell fish samples analysed.
 Residues of DDE, TDE and DDT found indicated the pollution originated from countries where DDT is still approved (or has recently been approved) for use.
 Eggs analysed as part of the Total Diet Survey in 1996 were found to contain residues as p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, p,p-TDE and p,p'-DDE.
 In another 1996 WPPR study which monitored geese for the first time, residues of DDT as p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDT were found in 25% of samples, a residue profile similar to that found in ducks in a 1995 survey.
 The presence of p'p-DDT may indicate more recent DDT exposure to these animals(23).
 The dietary intake of DDT is considerably higher in developing countries.
 In 1996, the World Health Organisation (WHO) assessed the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for DDT from a number of countries (see table 2).
 ADIs are the amount of pesticide that can be consumed every day for a lifetime without harm.
 They do not take into account other pesticide exposures, other forms of DDT exposure, such as occupational, or residue levels already in body fat.
 Human exposure exposure
 Analysis of human fat has been carried out occasionally in the UK showing that DDT can persist for many years.
 Analysis of 203 samples of mostly renal fat showed 99% contained detectable residues of DDT (see table 3)(24).
 Many of the levels found are above effect-level exposures required to elicit a carcinogenic response in test animals (see mice studies above).
 They are also well above the life-time safety exposure limit ADI of 0.02 mg/kg body weight.
 Once stored in fatty tissue, DDT residues are sequestrated and stabilised unless they are mobilised either through lactation or significant weight loss, which burns fat.
 Organochlorines appear to transfer freely across the placenta from mother to foetus.
 In one study involving humans, 17 people ate 35 mg/man daily (about 0.5 mg/kg daily) for 18 months suffering no ill-effect(25).
 In another study volunteers ate 0.31 to 0.61 mg/kg daily without any noticeable effects(26).
 Residue values tend to be higher for older people.
 According to John Wargo of Yale University in the US, children under the age of 14 have roughly one-third the level of those over 45, and African-Americans experience levels roughly three times those of whites for corresponding age classes.
 It is unclear whether the differences for African-Americans are due to a variation in environmental exposure, or because of genetic differences(27).
 DDT is excreted in human milk.
 Pesticides is used by pests developing resistance making the pesticide ineffective.
 A study carried out in Zimbabwe found high levels of DDE residues in breast milk commonly exceeded those required to cause hyporeflexia in infants(28).
 Between 1950 and 1970 DDT was used over large areas of the Soviet Union.
 As a result, dangerously high residue levels were found in both food and human tissue(29).
 DDT is found in the bodies of people living in the Arctic regions, where DDT has never been used.
 Along the west coast of Greenland, in Nunavik, Canada, and in Nikel on the Lola Peninsula of Russia, blood levels are only a factor of ten lower than the levels that are known to cause neurological effects in babies(30).
 Levels of p,p-DDT in the UK have reduced significantly since the mid 1960s.
 This would be expected, as DDT has not been approved since 1984.
 Levels of the breakdown product p,p'-DDE are not coming down so quickly.
 Although the average figure has more than halved, the range has not changed much since the mid 1960's, and has even increased compared with the early 1970s and early 1980s figures(31).
 Ecological effects effects
 Environmental fate fate
 DDT and its breakdown products have widespread persistence in the environment, and a high potential to bioaccumulate.
 It has a reported half-life in the environment of 2-15 years in most soils(32).
 Many governmental and inter-governmental organisations regard DDT as a major hazard to the environment(33).
 Fish Fish
 DDT is highly toxic to fish.
 The 96-hour LC50 (the concentration at which 50% of a test population die) ranges from 1.5 mg/litre for the largemouth bass to 56 mg/litre for guppy.
 Smaller fish are more susceptible than larger ones of the same species.
 An increase in temperature decreases the toxicity of DDT to fish(34).
 Birds Birds
 DDT and its metabolites can lower the reproductive rate of birds by causing eggshell thinning which leads to egg breakage, causing embryo deaths.
 Sensitivity to DDT varies considerably according to species(35).
 Predatory birds are the most sensitive.
 In the US, the bald eagle nearly became extinct because of environmental exposure to DDT.
 According to research by the World Wildlife Fund and the US EPA, birds in remote locations can be affected by DDT contamination.
 Albatross in the Midway islands of the mid-Pacific Ocean show classic signs of exposure to organochlorine chemicals, including deformed embryos, eggshell thinning and a 3% reduction in nest productivity.
 Researchers found levels of DDT in adults, chicks and eggs nearly as high as levels found in bald eagles from the North American Great Lakes(36).
 Developing countries countries
 A recent overview of organochlorine use in Africa during the last 25 years concluded that continued use has led to serious problems for wildlife in terms of uptake into the tissues of many animals groups, particularly birds, with potential long-term adverse population effects(37).
 Endocrine disrupters disrupters
 DDT, DDD and DDE are all strongly suspected of being environmental endocrine disrupters (chemicals that affect the hormonal system).
 DDT can have reproductive endocrine effects (see above) and also has a major toxic effect on the adrenal glands.
 DDT-related deformities in birds include clubbed feet and crossed bills.
 There is also concern that it has the potential to disrupt the endocrine system of humans(38).
 Resistance Resistance
 Many insect species have developed resistance to DDT.
 The first cases of resistant flies were known to scientists as early as 1947, although this was not widely reported at the time(39).
 In the intervening years, resistance problems increased mostly because of over-use in agriculture.
 By 1984 a world survey showed that 233 species, mostly insects, were resistant to DDT(40).
 Today, with cross resistance to several insecticides, it is difficult to obtain accurate figures on the situation regarding the number of pest species resistant to DDT.
 Global contamination contamination
 DDT is one of nine persistent organic pollutants (POPs) which bioaccumulate, and which are transported by air and water currents from warmer climates to temperate zones, where they have never been used.
 The process of degradation is dramatically slowed down in cooler climates.
 The global risk of adverse effects to human health and the environment has led the international community to mandate the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) to convene an intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) for a POPs Convention to phase out production and use.
 The first INC meeting takes place in June 1998.
 This action endorses the recommendations of the Inter-governmental Forum on Chemical Safety (IFCS) Ad Hoc Working Group on POPs(41 ,42).
 Conclusion Conclusion
 There is widespread global contamination of DDT.
 It is a hazard to the environment, both are areas where it is still used, and in many regions thousands of miles away where it is no longer, or never has been used.
 As a matter of urgency the use of DDT, a major POP, needs to be phased out.
 Pesticides in food:
 why go organic?
 An analysis of New Zealand's latest Total Diet Survey by Alison White White
 Pesticide Action Network NZ/Safe Food Campaign NZ Paper presented to the Organics 2020 Conference, Unitech, Auckland, 20 May 2000 2000
 Executive summary summary
 The Ministry of Health assures us that "the pesticide residue levels found in [the latest Total Diet Survey] are unlikely to have any adverse health implications for the New Zealand population." Their conclusions are based on the assumption that pesticide levels below the Acceptable Daily Intake are safe.
 But this is based in turn on several unscientific assumptions, such as that we are exposed to only one chemical at a time.
 Results from the survey are furthermore questionable with the very small sample sizes being analysed:
 86% of the 114 foods tested had a mere two composite samples analysed.
 Young children in New Zealand are getting about five times more pesticide residues than young American children.
 A sizable proportion of young NZ children could suffer from acute organophosphate poisoning from the residues in their food.
 The young child, aged 1�3 years old, takes in more pesticide residues than other age-sex groups, more than two and a half times more than men, for example.

 The percentage of total samples with pesticide residues is significantly greater than some other countries, for example, the UK and the US.
 Wine, grains, especially wheat, and meat are more likely to contain pesticide residues than other food groups.
 When ranked according to the number of pesticides in combination with the percentage containing residues, bread and wheat products, wine, fruit and salad vegetables come out worst.
 Recent findings concerning the endocrine disrupting potential of certain pesticides, eight of which are found in this survey, are a matter of grave concern, with disturbing consequences for the future of the individual, the family and society as a whole.
 A group of fungicides of concern, the most common of which is mancozeb, a known endocrine disruptor, continue to be used on a wide range of fruit and vegetables.
 Analysis of the latest Total Diet Survey reveals tragically unnecessary pesticide residues in the New Zealand diet.
 With co-operation from regulatory authorities and growers and farmers, New Zealand can become an organic nation by 2020.
 Young children at risk risk
 Young children in NZ are still getting about five times more pesticide residues than young American children.
 A similar calculation was made from data in the last survey, but this time comparing 13 pesticides.
 (See Figure 1) While organo-chlorine levels continue to fall, and are now similar to US levels of the late 80s, the levels for organophosphates and fungicides have both disturbingly risen to almost twice the level, expressed as estimated daily intake for young children in micrograms/kg bw/day.
 Young children are at special risk from acute poisoning from pesticide residues in food, especially from organophos-phates.
 In this total diet survey young children are estimated to consume almost three times as many organophosphate residues as men.
 (See Figure 2) US researchers from the National Research Council concluded that young children could suffer from acute poisoning from the residues in their food.
 They actually calculated that two-year-olds could exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) (of chlorpyrifos) 4.1% of the time, basing their figures on just five pesticides and eight foods (NRC 1993).
 In Figure 1 we can see how the estimated daily intake of organophosphates in NZ young children is more than 20 times that of young US children.
 This means that a certain sizable proportion of NZ children could suffer from acute organophosphate poisoning.
 Common symptoms include tingling mouth, increased saliva, blurring of vision, sore stomach, nausea, diarrhoea.
 Two of the organophosphates found at high levels, pirimiphos methyl and chlorpyrifos methyl, are applied post harvest to grain in storage.
 Of concern is that young children have increased their intake of the organophosphate chlorpyrifos methyl more than elevenfold compared to the last total diet survey.
 This pesticide is now found in a wider range of foods (anything containing wheat) and at higher levels.
 Young NZ children consume an estimated 20 times more fungicide when five fungicides are compared to US data (chlorothalonil, dichloran, diphenyl-amine, iprodione and vinclozolin).
 Compared to other age-sex groups, young children (1�3 year olds) have the highest levels of pesticide residues in their diets.
 In Figure 2 it can be seen that they have an estimated daily intake of pesticides which is more than two and a half times more than men.
 This is mainly because children eat more food in proportion to their body weight than other groups, but also because they tend to eat more food like fruit which is highly sprayed.
 Interestingly, lacto-ovo-vegetarian females (dairy and egg eating), measured for the first time in this survey, consume about 50% more pesticide residues than other females.
 This seems to be due to the estimation that they eat more bread, more fruit and more of certain vegetables.
 This group does take in lower levels of DDT and other organochlorines due to their not eating meat.
 Fig.
 2 Estimated pesticide daily intake intake
 Totals of 17 pesticides for age-sex groups groups

 NZ Total Diet Survey 1997/98 1997/98
 Which foods have more pesticide residues?
 Wine, grains and animals are more likely to contain pesticide residues than other food groups.
 Animals analysed included chicken, eggs, fish, meat as well as pizza.
 79% of animal samples analysed had DDE, the persistent metabolite of DDT.
 The highest levels were found in butter, luncheon sausage and beef sausage sausage
 DDT is the main contaminant of dairy products as well, especially ones with fat like butter, cheese, and whole milk.
 A comparison between American dairy products and New Zealand ones is startling:
 New Zealand's rate of contamination is so much higher:
 68.2% as opposed to 3.4%.
 "The Dirty Dozen" Dozen"
 Which foods is it especially good to avoid if non-organic and make an effort to buy organically?
 The 12 worst foods from the point of view of number of pesticides and percentage with pesticide residues were:
 The ranking of the other foods on the dirty dozen list isn't necessarily very accurate because of the small number in each sample.
 Bread and wheat products are at the top of the list, with residues detected in 94.4% of 90 samples.
 Wheat products include bran cereal, biscuits, flour, noodles, spaghetti, wheatbix, cake, pizza, sausages, luncheon sausage, muesli, hamburger, meat pie and the batter around fish.
 The chances are you are also taking in organophosphate or insecticide residues most of the time you eat something with flour in it.
 Most of these residues result from the post harvest application of a fumigant on the stored grain (chlorpyrifos methyl, pirimiphos-methyl, piperonyl butoxide, fenitrothion,).
 The level of these insecticides does not seem to have decreased overall since the Total Diet Survey in 1990/91, even though NZ's residues are much higher than either the UK or US.
 The US had residues in 27% of wheat and wheat products, in contrast to New Zealand's 94%, for example! Other countries are increasingly using non-pesticide means of storage for their grain, for example, cold storage or carbon dioxide.
 Wine is second on the list, with all 12 samples having iprodione, a fungicide in them.
 The good news is that the levels of vinclozolin, a known endocrine disruptor, have fallen.
 (It has just recently been deregistered.) The bad news is that grape growers seem to be substituting another fungicide, using more iprodione instead.
 Overall, levels of iprodione in food have increased 80% since the last Total Diet Survey.
 Iprodione, a chemical cousin to vinclozolin, can cause cancer.
 Close contenders for the dirty dozen list were lettuce, dairy products, meat and potatoes.
 Health effects of these pesticides pesticides
 Many of the pesticides found as residues in our food have been found in independent studies to have serious long term effects including hormonal disruption, cancer, immune system suppression, nervous system damage, genetic damage and birth defects.
 Children are at special risk with any substance capable of causing cancer and nervous system damage.
 A number of animal studies have shown that animals are at greater risk of developing cancer if exposure began in infancy rather than later in life.
 Of 14 carcinogens reviewed by the US Natural Resources Defense Council, the young were more susceptible to 12 (Whyatt 1989).
 The reason for such susceptibility may be linked with rapid cell division entailed in development and growth.
 Also children have more of their lives still to live during which exposure and carcinogenic action may occur.
 The young are especially susceptible to the acute effects of organophosphate insecticides.
 Endocrine disruption disruption
 Recent research has brought to light another class of adverse effects from various pesticides and other chemicals.
 Several pesticides (as well as some widely used industrial chemicals) can disrupt the body's endocrine or hormonal system � so crucial in growth and development.
 These endocrine disruptors can mimic or disrupt the normal functions of hormones, and tamper with this delicately balanced signaling system in the body, which governs a range of functions and developmental processes.
 Though their effects in human beings are still being debated, the evidence is mounting.
 From wildlife and animal studies in laboratories, there is growing concern that these endocrine disruptors can cause developmental, reproductive, behavioural, immunological and physiological changes.
 Particularly worrisome is the threat that endocrine disruptors pose on the unborn.
 When acting on a developing foetus at critical periods, they can cause lasting damage at minute doses, which were previously not thought to be harmful.
 Theo Colborn, researcher and author of the book "Our Stolen Future", expressed:
 "We are neutering the population; we are making females more masculine and males more feminine." feminine."
 Eight pesticides found in this survey are known endocrine disruptors:
 DDT, dicofol, endosulfan, chlorpyrifos, di-methoate, fenitrothion, mancozeb (as dithiocarbamates) and vinclozolin.
 There are various other pesticides structurally related to these which are suspect.
 The dithiocarbamates are a group of fungicides including mancozeb, metiram, zineb and ziram which have a metabolite called ethylene thiourea (ETU).
 This breakdown product is a known endocrine disruptor, carcinogen, mutagen and teratogen, and can concentrate upon processing and heating.
 In other words, if you cook a vegetable which has been sprayed with mancozeb (the most common), you will be increasing the amount of the dangerous metabolite.
 Over 60% of the 138 samples of fruit and vegetables analysed for dithio-carbamates in the latest total diet survey contained them.
 The 17 fruit and vegetables ranked in order according to occurrence and mean concentration are:
 broccoli, cabbage, tomato, celery, lettuce, onions, cucumber, apples, oranges, mushrooms, potatoes, courgettes, kumara, nectarines, pears, capsicum and kiwifruit.
 Conclusion Conclusion
 The young, those who suffer from chronic illness and anyone who eats more bread, fruit and vegetables than average are more at risk both short term and long term from pesticide residues in their diet.
 For these people particularly, it is important to increase the amount of organic food eaten, especially those foods which are heavily sprayed.
 In general, if you are trying to reduce pesticide residues in your diet, especially seek out organic bread, fruit and salad vegetables, meat and butter.
 It is especially important for pregnant women and women who may conceive to eat organic wheat, fruit, vegetables, meat, cheese and butter.
 Ideally, a woman would detoxify before conceiving (pesticides are passed through the placenta and breast milk).
 We can help protect ourselves from a toxic environment by eating organic food, and by demanding a benign system of agriculture and an economy and infrastructure that does not depend on pouring pollutants into the atmosphere, rivers and seas.SF seas.SF

 Introduction Introduction
 Over the past several decades, pesticides and other agricultural chemicals and veterinary drugs have become an important factor in food production.
 The availability of these chemicals has enabled significant increases in agricultural productivity to be achieved.
 While the consumption of agricultural and veterinary chemicals is not desirable in itself, ingestion of these substances in the form of residues in agricultural produce may occur as a consequence of their intended use.
 Residues resulting from proper agricultural use are low as has been consistently demonstrated in Market Basket Surveys.
 Nevertheless, it is essential that a mechanism exists to assess the likelihood of risks to the public, and to reduce these risks to a minimum.
 Prior to the registration of an agricultural or veterinary chemical product, applicants must provide registration authorities with a great deal of information in support of the use of the product, including details of toxicological studies.
 The toxicological studies are assessed with a view to determining the potential hazards associated with exposure to the chemical and also, where the chemical is used on food producing crops or animals, to establishing a level of intake which would be without appreciable risk to consumers.
 The toxicological hazards of existing chemicals are reviewed as further data becomes available.
 Toxicological studies required for agricultural and veterinary chemicals range from those measuring single dose effects to those which examine the effects of lifetime exposure.
 Toxicity studies are generally performed on laboratory animals such as mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs and are designed to identify potential toxic effects.
 The studies usually involve the feeding/administration of various levels of the compound under investigation to animals, followed by observation and monitoring of clinical parameters and pathology which are indicative of toxicity in the test species.
 The range of toxicological studies required to be undertaken is detailed in the "Ag Manual:
 The Requirements Manual for Agricultural Chemicals" and the "Vet Manual:
 The Requirements Manual for Veterinary Chemicals" which are published by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).
 The immediate hazards from a chemical are determined by identifying the acute toxicity by the most likely routes of exposure, together with tests for skin and eye irritation and skin sensitisation.
 The potential for toxicity over longer periods, including possible tumour induction, is determined by studying the effects of repeated dosing, in some cases for the entire lifespan of the species.
 Multigeneration and developmental studies predict reproductive toxicity and the potential to cause birth defects, and studies are performed to assess the potential to cause effects on genetic material.
 Other specific investigations also may be required to clarify the mechanism of toxicity of a particular chemical.
 Designs for the conduct of toxicological studies have become standardised to a large extent and international guidelines have been developed to achieve consistency in experimental techniques.
 In general, groups of the test species/organism are exposed to a number of dose levels (usually three) of the substance and a further group is left unexposed (control group).
 The treatment levels are selected so that the highest dose will cause some obvious toxic effects, while the lowest dose at least, should not result in a toxic effect.
 During the course of the study a range of observations is made in each group and a comparison is made of the findings in each treated group versus the control group.
 Assessment of individual toxicity studies includes the determination of a no-observable-effect level (NOEL), which is the highest administered dose which does not cause any detectable (usually adverse) effect in the study.
 The overall NOEL for a chemical, determined in the most sensitive species, is then used to estimate the acceptable daily intake.
 The acceptable daily intake (ADI) for humans is considered to be a level of intake of a chemical that can be ingested daily over an entire lifetime without any appreciable risk to health.
 It is calculated by dividing the overall NOEL from the animal studies by a safety factor.
 The magnitude of the safety factor is selected to account for uncertainties in extrapolation of animal data to humans, variation between humans, the completeness of the toxicological data base and the nature of the potential adverse effects.
 The most common safety factor is 100 which takes into account that humans may be 10 times more sensitive to the chemical than experimental animals and that a proportion of the population may be 10 times more sensitive than the average person.
 Where there is satisfactory information in humans, there is no necessity to extrapolate from animal data and a safety factor of 10 is considered adequate to account for inter-individual variation.
 On the other hand when the toxicity data base is incomplete or when the nature of the potential hazards indicate the need for additional caution, a further safety factor of 10 to 20 may be incorporated.
 In these situations, the overall NOEL is divided by a safety factor of 1000 to 2000 in determining the ADI.
 It is important to note that the toxicological studies on which the overall NOEL is based are invariably carried out by oral dosing of animals and usually by incorporation of the chemical in the diet.
 The subsequent establishment of an ADI is thus directed to human exposure by the oral route.
 Due to possible differences in absorption and other kinetic and metabolic parameters, the comparison of intakes by other routes with the ADI should be interpreted with caution.
 Notes Notes
 Use of the terms JMPR or JECFA in the NOEL column indicates that the Australian ADI has been adopted from the figure established by the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) or the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA).
 (H) indicates that the NOEL was determined on the basis of experimental data in humans.
 The words "not necessary" in the ADI column indicates that there is a large margin of safety for consumption of residues in food when the chemical is used according to good agricultural/veterinary practice.
 Due to low levels of residues and the lack of oral activity of these chemicals, a numerical ADI is not considered necessary.
 (M) indicates that the ADI is derived from microbiological data.
 TDI means Tolerable Daily Intake.
 ADIs are not maintained for those agricultural and veterinary chemicals that are no longer permitted for use in agricultural practice.
 However, residues of certain environmentally persistent pesticides may occur as residues in agricultural commodities as a consequence of past use.
 In these cases, health intake values are maintained as Tolerable Daily Intake values, to serve as a guideline with which potential dietary intakes of these environmentally persistent chemicals can be compared.
 'Deleted' means that an ADI had previously been established but that the chemical is no longer permitted for use on food-producing crops or animals.
 Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) for Pesticide Regulatory Purposes stems from the experience of the EC funded project DEMETRA.
 This project combined institutes involved in the regulatory process of pesticides, industries of the sector and scientists to develop and offer original software for the prediction of ecotoxicity of pesticides.
 Then to be used within the dossier preparation for pesticide registration.
 The basis of this book is more than three-years of research activities, discussions, studies and successful models.
 This experience represents a useful example not only for the case of pesticides, but also for the prediction of ecotoxicity and toxicity in general.
 QSAR is used to link a given property of a chemical compound with some features related to its structure.
 The theoretical toxicological, chemical and information technology aspects will be treated considering the regulatory issues.
 Innovative hybrid systems will be described, for the toxicity prediction of pesticides and related compounds, directly useful for pesticide evaluation within the Dossier preparation for pesticide registration.
 Five endpoints will also be discussed, addressing issues as standardisation, verification, validation, accessibility, reproducibility.
 The driving force for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) for Pesticide Regulatory Purposes is that all the issues of concern for end-users are analysed, discussed and solutions proposed further.
 An innovative feature is that, in order to offer powerful QSAR models, the book discusses and reports on integrated QSAR models, combined into a unique hybrid system.
 Herbicides (benzodiazepinediones), insecticides (dioxatricyclododecenes) and larvicides (N-oxalyl derivatives of tebufenozide) have been quantitatively investigated to explore the relationship between the molecular structure and their biological activity using molecular operating environment (MOE) software.
 The study provides good predictive models, cross-validated by leave-out-one method (Loo).
 The positive contribution of the descriptor n-O (count of oxygen atom) suggests the additional oxygen atom substitution at R1 position, in addition to benzodiazepine moiety is favorable for herbicidal activity, whereas the negative contribution of y component of dipole moment (Dip(y)) indicates that electronic interactions are also crucial for the activity.
 The negative correlation of V(SA)2 and globularity (Glo) descriptors clearly indicates that the volume, shape, and rigidity of tebufenozide derivatives determine their larvicidal activity.
 The biparametric model for insecticides shows that the indicator variable l(CH-CH3) and R(PC) (negative partial charge) are detrimental for its activity.
 Most of the active compounds in the series have shown less value for these descriptors.
 The derived QSAR models also provide valuable insights to optimize their toxicity, which remains a major concern for environment safety.

  The synthesis of several derivatives of a xenobiotic (phenoxyalkanecarboxylic acid) and an alpha-amino acid (L-lysine) is described.
 Various substituents were introduced in the aromatic ring of the phenoxyalkanecarboxylic acid and the side-chain was modified.
 They were tested for their effect on the transport of a neutral (L-threonine), an acidic (L-glutamic acid) and a basic (L-lysine) amino acid, and a sugar (sucrose).
 All compounds markedly inhibited threonine uptake by leaf tissues of Vicia faba L.--and more specifically phloem loading--with two exceptions, when the aromatic ring was substituted in the 4-position by a primary amino group or when D-lysine was used instead of L-lysine.
 By contrast, the addition of a chlorine atom in the 4-position of the aromatic ring enhanced the inhibitory activity.
 Similar results were obtained for inhibition of glutamate uptake and, to a lesser extent, for lysine uptake.
 pH dependence of the inhibitory activity as well as electrophysiological data indicate that permeases mediating active transport of amino acids are the target of these conjugates.
 These, in addition to other data obtained with other xenobiotics, show that the amino acid carrier system is capable of recognizing a wide range of conjugates of various sizes, structures and octanol/water partition coefficients.
 Quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling of the toxicity of organothiophosphate pesticides to Daphnia magna and Cyprinus carpioby Elton Zvinavashe | Papers by Elton Elton
 Within the REACH regulatory framework in the EU, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) models are expected to help reduce the number of animals used for experimental testing.
 The objective of this study was to develop QSAR models to describe the acute toxicity of organothiophosphate pesticides to aquatic organisms.
 Literature data sets for acute toxicity data of organothiophosphates to fish and one data set from experiments with 15 organothiophosphates on Daphnia magna performed in the present study were used to establish QSARs based on quantum mechanically derived molecular descriptors.
 The logarithm of the octanol/water partition coefficient, logK(ow,) the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, E(lumo), and the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital, E(homo) were used as descriptors.
 Additionally, it was investigated if toxicity data for the invertebrate D.
 magna could be used to build a QSAR model to predict toxicity to fish.
 Suitable QSAR models (0.80<r(2)<0.82) were derived to predict acute toxicity of organothiophosphates to fish (Cyprinus carpio) and the invertebrate (D.
 magna).
 Toxicity data for D.
 magna correlated well (r(2)=0.94) with toxicity data for C.
 carpio.
 This implies that by performing toxicity tests with D.
 magna, one can use our interspecies QSAR model to predict the acute toxicity of organothiophosphates to fish.
 The three QSAR models were validated either both internally and externally (D.
 magna) or internally only (carp and D.
 magna to carp).
 For each QSAR model, an applicability domain was defined based on the chemical structures and the ranges of the descriptor values of the training set compounds.
 From the 100196 European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical Substances (EINECS), 83 compounds were identified that fit the selection criteria for the QSAR models.
 For these compounds, using our QSAR models, one can obtain an indication of their toxicity without the need for additional experimental testing .
 The sciatic nerve-sartorius muscle preparation from the frog, the nerve-muscle preparation from the crayfish, and the abdominal nerve cord preparation from the crayfish have been compared for their sensitivity to various insecticides.
 The crayfish nerve cord was the most sensitive to insecticides and had a broad spectrum of sensitivity.
 A method was developed with this preparation to compare a large number of synthetic pyrethroids for their potencies to stimulate and block the nerve which is the primary target site.
 Both stimulating and blocking actions on the nerve can be assessed with this preparation.
 Certain pyrethroids are active insecticidally despite their weak nerve action, whereas some other pyrethroids are relatively moderate in killing insects despite their potent nerve action.
 Thus the new method can be effectively used to establish the true structure-activity relationship of synthetic pyrethroids or any other insecticides acting directly on the nerve.

 Design, evaluation and structure�Activity relationship studies of the AChE reactivators against organophosphorus pesticidesRecommend article Print articleRSS feed share Twitter Facebook Delicious Mr.
 Wong Digg StumbleUpon Connotea CiteULike Abstract Abstract
 Organophosphate pesticides (OPPs; e.g.
 chlorpyrifos, diazinon, paraoxon) are a wide and heterogeneous group of organophosphorus compounds.
 Their biological activity of inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) ranks them as life endangering agents.
 The necessary treatment after OPP exposure involves the use of parasympatolytics (e.g.
 atropine), oxime reactivators (e.g.
 obidoxime), and anticonvulsive drugs (e.g.
 diazepam).
 Therefore, the reactivators of AChE are essential compounds in the treatment of OPP intoxications.
 Commercial AChE reactivators (e.g.
 pralidoxime, HI-6, obidoxime, trimedoxime, methoxime) were originally developed for other members of the organophosphate family, such as nerve agents (e.g.
 sarin, soman, tabun, VX).
 Pralidoxime, HI-6, and methoxime were found to be weak reactivators of OPP-inhibited AChE.
 Obidoxime and trimedoxime showed satisfactory reactivation against various OPPs with minor toxicity issues.
 During the last two decades, the treatment of OPP exposure has become more widely discussed because of growing agricultural production, industrialization, and harmful social issues (e.g.
 suicides).
 In this review is the summarized design, evaluation, and structure�activity relationship studies of recently produced AChE reactivators.
 Since pralidoxime, over 300 oximes have been produced or tested against OPP poisoning, and several novel compounds show very promising abilities as comparable (or higher) to commercial oximes.
 Some of these are highlighted for their further testing of OPP exposure and, additionally, the main structure�activity relationship of AChE reactivators against OPP is discussed.

 Structure-activity relationships of aryl alkynyl synergists of the general formula of Ar-Q-R, where Q represents a bridging structure, were studied using a standardised testing system and Relative Potency values.
 Ethers, esters, oxime ethers, amides and amines were prepared and evaluated.
 The length of the R-alkynyl chain, the role of the bridge and the substitution of the aromatic ring were examined systematically.
 The most potent compounds possessed an aromatic ring connected via a bridge of three atoms to an alkynyl chain, forming together a linear side-chain of six atoms.
 Several highly potent compounds were synthesised of which one (MB-599; proposed common name verbutin) was selected for development as a selective insecticide synergist in crop protection.
 Its high potential at practical insecticide:synergist ratios makes possible the reduction of the total amount of insect-control chemicals applied, and its use as an additive to produce new formulations of existing insecticides makes it highly advantageous in resistance management, giving a new tool to sustain the effectiveness of a wide range of insecticides.
 A product containing a (1+1) mixture of verbutin and beta-cypermethrin was launched in Hungary in 2002.

 IRAC's Insecticide Mode of Action Classification1 Classification1
 Frederick M.
 Fishel2 Fishel2
 This guide explains the rationale behind the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee's (IRAC) insecticide and acaricide mode of action classification and provides a listing of those insecticide common names with their groupings and primary modes of action for insecticides currently registered in Florida.
 What is IRAC?
 IRAC has groups formed in several countries, including the United States, Brazil, South Africa, Spain, India, and Australia.
 The group's purpose is to communicate and educate agricultural producers and crop protection professionals by providing resistance management information.
 Members of an IRAC group are generally professionals who are actively engaged in the insecticide and acaricide manufacturing industry.
 Some university researchers also participate.
 Resistance to Pesticides Pesticides
 Resistance refers to an inheritable change in the sensitivity of a pest population that is reflected in the repeated failure of a product to achieve the expected level of control when used according to the label recommendation for that pest species.
 Resistance does not always occur, but has been documented with insecticides as early as 1914.
 There are many known instances today where resistance is a problem.
 Not only has resistance occurred with insecticides but also with other pesticides, such as fungicides, herbicides, and rodenticides.
 Complicating the understanding and management of resistance is the problem of knowing which type of resistance is present in a given pest population.
 For example, some pest populations are known to have cross-resistance.
 That is, they are not effectively controlled with pesticides having the same mode of action that generally targets the same site within the pest.
 For example, both the carbamate and organophosphate insecticides target acetylcholine esterase, although each group of insecticides is chemically different from one another.
 The greatest resistance concern arises when multiple-resistance is confirmed.
 Multiple-resistance is the situation of a pest population that is resistant to pesticides having different modes of action.
 It is the most difficult type of resistance to manage because the number of management options is reduced.
 For more information on resistance, see UF/IFAS EDIS Document ENY-624, 2011 Florida Citrus Pest Management Guide:
 Pesticide Resistance and Resistance Management, http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/cg026.
 IRAC's Classification Scheme Scheme
 IRAC's insecticide classification scheme is based on mode of action.
 The goal of the scheme is to provide information to applicators of acaricides and insecticides so that they can make sound decisions on selecting insecticides to prevent or manage resistance.
 Besides selecting products that have different modes of action, growers are also encouraged to integrate other methods into insect and mite control programs.
 Table 1 contains those acaricides and insecticides registered for use in Florida, though it changes constantly.
 They are listed according to IRAC's classification scheme by their group and subgroup codes, primary target site of action, chemical sub-group or exemplifying active ingredient, and active ingredient, based on that appearing in The Pesticide Manual, 15th edition, 2009, edited by C.D.S.
 Tomlin, published by The British Crop Protection Council.
 Today�s insecticides and fungicides are manufactured from literally hundreds of chemical compounds � both organic and inorganic.
 These chemical compounds, in turn, can be grouped into several dozen chemical groups.
 Each group of insecticides and fungicides has associated with it a particular mode of activity or mode of action (MOA).
 These MOAs serve to describe how a particular chemical or chemical group acts to kill or disable insects or fungi.
 Table 1 summarizes the six major MOAs and associated chemical groups for insecticides, and Table 2 summarizes the six major MOAs and associated chemical groups for fungicides.
 Chemical Group and Insecticide Modes of Activity Activity
 Inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase which serves to interrupt the transmission of nerve impulses.
 Chlorinated Hydro- carbons and Pyrethroids Pyrethroids
 Act as axonic poisons by interfering with the sodium channels of both the peripheral and central nervous system thereby stimulating repetitive nervous discharges, leading to paralysis.
 Macrocyclic Lactone and Carbazates Carbazates
 Interferes with the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptors of insect neurons leading to repetitive nervous discharges.
 Chloronicotinyls Chloronicotinyls
 Bind to acetylcholine receptors thereby disrupting nerve impulse transmission.
 Pyridine, Triazine, Insect Growth Regulators Regulators
 Insect growth regulators are chitin synthesis inhibitors or juvenile hormone mimics.
 Chitin synthesis inhibitors prevent the formation of chitin, an essential compound in an insect�s exoskeleton.
 Juvenile hormone mimics cause insects to remain in an early/young life stage.
 Soaps and Oils Oils
 Soaps and oils work by either damaging the waxy layer of the exoskeleton of soft-bodied insects, resulting in dessication (drying), or by covering the breathing pores (spiracles) of insects, resulting in suffocation.
 Here�s the important point for rosarians:
 insects and fungi can develop resistance to insecticides and fungicides if products having the same MOAs are used repeatedly.
 The organism targeted for control by a chemical, or chemicals, with a particular MOA will ultimately mutate and possibly become immune to that MOA.
 The solution to this problem is to rotate the chemicals used among the different MOAs so that, for example, the fungus that is becoming resistant to MOA-x is now confronted with MOA-y, and so on.
 Rotation among the MOAs can be done over time.
 For example, spray a product with MOA-x one week and one with MOA-y the next.
 For equal effectiveness, products with two different MOAs can be tank-mixed (if they are otherwise compatible) and applied together.
 An example of the latter approach can be found in the over-the-counter insecticide Bayer Advanced Garden Rose & Flower Insect Killer manufactured by the Bayer Company.
 This product combines Merit (MOA 4) and Tempo (MOA 2) in a ready to use (RTU) spray.
 Table 2.
 Chemical Group and Fungicide Modes of Action Action
 MOA CHEMICAL GROUP GROUP
 HOW THEY WORK WORK
 Demethylation Inhibitor (DMI) fungicides such as triazoles and imidazoles, imidazoles,
 Inhibits the biosynthesis of sterol in fungal membranes.
 There are five classes of these sterol biosynthesis inhibitors (SBI) encompassing 44 different active ingredients � for example, propiconazole, the active ingredient in Banner MAXX.
 Methyl Benzimidazole Carbamates � the MBC fungicides such as thiophanates, benzimidazoles, etc.
 Interferes with fungal mitosis (normal cell division).
 There are four groups of mitosis inhibiting chemicals encompassing nine different active ingredients � for example, thiophanate-methyl, the active ingredient in Cleary�s 3336F.
 Dicarboximides and Carbamates Carbamates
 Inhibits membrane synthesis and promotes the oxidation of fungal lipid (�fat�) molecules.
 Phenylamides (PA) fungicides fungicides
 Inhibits the synthesis of nucleic acids, both DNA and RNA.
 There are three other groups closely related to the PA group, and they and the PA group encompass 12 different active ingredients.
 Carboxamides plus Quinone outside Inhibitors (QoI) and Quinone inside Inhibitors (QiI) fungicides fungicides
 Interferes with fungal respiration.
 There are seven classes of respiration inhibitors encompassing 28 different active ingredients � for example, trifloxystrobin, the active ingredient in the QoI fungicide, Compass.
 Multi-Site Contact Activity Activity
 These fungicides simply act to kill the fungus by overwhelming it with materials that are poisonous to it.
 These fungicides are primarily based on inorganics such as aluminum, copper, and sulfur, and upon the dithiocarbamates combined with zinc and manganese ions � this latter group includes the fungicides Manzate, Maneb, and Junction.
 Low risk of resistance buildup.
 Now you know that there are basically six MOAs for insecticides and fungicides.
 And you know not to repeatedly use insecticides or fungicides from the same MOA.
 However, I recognize that it�s unlikely you can go to your local garden supply store and say to the salesperson, �I�d like 6 oz.
 of a methyl benzimidazole carbamate fungicide, please� � I don�t think that would work.
 Therefore, in the next two tables I�ve identified popular-with-rosarians insecticides (Table 3) and fungicides (Table 4) by their trade names, and grouped them into their respective MOAs.
 Also identified in the tables are the toxicities of each product, based on the signal word on the labels, i.e., C = Caution, W = Warning, and D = Danger, and the type of product, i.e., S = Systemic, T = Translaminar or Locally Systemic, and C = Contact.
 Systemic means the product is absorbed by the plant and moves upward through the plant�s vascular system (but not into the bloom).
 Translaminar means the product is absorbed by the plant but does not move through it.
 And, contact means the product is active only on the plant�s surface where it was sprayed.
 Based on my experience with the rotation of fungicides I use a combination of the two rotation approaches to successfully control (indeed, eliminate) black spot.
 For example, I use Banner MAXX, Cleary�s 3336F, and Compass � each of which has a different MOA.
 One time I spray with a tank mix of Banner MAXX and Compass, and the next with a mixture of Cleary�s 3336F and Compass.
 This avoids the fungus being exposed to the same MOA for any length of time.

 Common Name Name
 A generic name for a chemical compound (see the Weed Science Society of America list of herbicide nomenclature).
 For example:
 The common name for 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinoxyacetic acid..
 is triclopyr.
 The common name is the name generally used in discussing pesticidal toxicology and environmental behavior and fate.
 Pesticide Names:
 Product Name Name

 An insecticide is a pesticide used against insects.
 They include ovicides and larvicides used against the eggs and larvae of insects respectively.
 Insecticides are used in agriculture, medicine, industry and the household.
 The use of insecticides is believed to be one of the major factors behind the increase in agricultural productivity in the 20th century. Nearly all insecticides have the potential to significantly alter ecosystems; many are toxic to humans; and others are concentrated in the food chain. needed]
 The classification of insecticides is done in several different ways: needed]
 Systemic insecticides are incorporated by treated plants.
 Insects ingest the insecticide while feeding on the plants.
 Contact insecticides are toxic to insects brought into direct contact.
 Efficacy is often related to the quality of pesticide application, with small droplets (such as aerosols) often improving performance.[2] performance.[2]
 Natural insecticides, such as nicotine, pyrethrum and neem extracts are made by plants as defenses against insects.
 Nicotine based insecticides are still being widely used in the US and Canada though they are barred in the EU.[3] EU.[3]
 Plant-incorporated protectants (PIPs) are insecticidal substances produced by plants after genetic modification.[4] For instance, a gene that codes for a specific Baccilus thuringiensis biocidal protein is introduced into a crop plant's genetic material.
 Then, the plant manufactures the protein.
 Since the biocide is incorporated into the plant, additional applications at least of the same compound, are not required.
 Inorganic insecticides are manufactured with metals and include arsenates, copper compounds and fluorine compounds, which are now seldom used, and sulfur, which is commonly used.
 Organic insecticides are synthetic chemicals which comprise the largest numbers of pesticides available for use today.
 Mode of action�how the pesticide kills or inactivates a pest�is another way of classifying insecticides.
 Mode of action is important in predicting whether an insecticide will be toxic to unrelated species, such as fish, birds and mammals.
  OrganochloridesThe insecticidal properties of the best known representative of this class of insecticides, DDT, was made by the Swiss Scientist Paul M�ller.
 For this discovery, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1948.[5] DDT was introduced on the market in 1944.
 With the rise of the modern chemical industry, it was possible to make chlorinated hydrocarbons.
 DDT works by opening the sodium channels in the nerve cells of the insect.
  OrganophosphatesThe next large class developed was the organophosphates, which bind to acetylcholinesterase and other cholinesterases.
 This results in disruption of nerve impulses, killing the insect or interfering with its ability to carry on normal functions.
 Organophosphate insecticides and chemical warfare nerve agents (such as sarin, tabun, soman and VX) work in the same way.
 Organophosphates have an accumulative toxic effect to wildlife, so multiple exposures to the chemicals amplifies the toxicity.[6] toxicity.[6]
  CarbamatesCarbamate insecticides have similar toxic mechanisms to organophosphates, but have a much shorter duration of action and are thus somewhat less toxic. needed]
  PyrethroidsTo mimic the insecticidal activity of the natural compound pyrethrum another class of pesticides, pyrethroid pesticides, has been developed.
 These are nonpersistent sodium channel modulators, and are much less acutely toxic than organophosphates and carbamates.
 Compounds in this group are often applied against household pests. needed]
  NeonicotinoidsNeonicotinoids are synthetic analogues of the natural insecticide nicotine (with a much lower acute mammalian toxicity and greater field persistence).
 These chemicals are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists.
 Broad-spectrum�systemic insecticides, they have a rapid action (minutes-hours).
 They are applied as sprays, drenches, seed and soil treatments�often as substitutes for organophosphates and carbamates.
 Treated insects exhibit leg tremors, rapid wing motion, stylet withdrawal (aphids), disoriented movement, paralysis and death. needed]
  RyanoidsRyanoids are synthetic chemicals with the same mode of action as ryanodine, a natural insecticide extracted from Ryania speciosa (Flacourtiaceae).
 They bind to calcium channels in cardiac and skeletal muscle, blocking nervous transmission.
 Apparently only one such insecticide is currently registered, Rynaxypyr, generic name chlorantraniliprole.[7] chlorantraniliprole.[7]
  Insect Growth RegulatorsInsect growth regulators is a term coined to include insect hormone mimics and an earlier class of chemicals, the benzoylphenyl ureas, which inhibit chitin (exoskeleton) biosynthesis in insects.
 Diflubenzuron is a member of the latter class,used primarily to control caterpillars which are pests.
 The most successful insecticides in this class are the juvenoids (juvenile hormone analogues).
 Of these, methoprene is most widely used.
 It has no observable acute toxicity in rats, and is approved by WHO for use in drinking water cisterns to combat malaria.
 Most of its uses are to combat insects where the adult is the pest, including mosquitoes, several fly species, and fleas.
 Two very similar products, hydroprene and kinoprene are used for controlling species such as cockroaches and white flies.
 Methoprene has been registered with the EPA since 1975, and there are virtually no reports of resistance.
 A more recent type of IGR is the ecdysone agonist tebufenozide (MIMIC), which is used in forestry and other applications for control of caterpillars, which are far more sensitive to its hormonal effects than other insect orders.
  Biological insecticidesRecent efforts to reduce broad spectrum toxins added to the environment have brought biological insecticides back into vogue.
 An example is the development and increase in use of Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterial disease of Lepidopterans and some other insects.
 Toxins produced by different strains of this bacterium are used as a larvicide against caterpillars, beetles, and mosquitoes.
 Toxins from Saccharopolyspora spinosa are isolated from fermentations and sold as Spinosad.
 Because these toxins have little effect on other organisms, they are considered more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides.
 The toxin from B.
 thuringiensis (Bt toxin) has been incorporated directly into plants through the use of genetic engineering.
 Other biological insecticides include products based on entomopathogenic fungi (e.g.
 Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae), nematodes (e.g.
 Steinernema feltiae) and viruses (e.g.
 Cydia pomonella granulovirus). needed]
  AntifeedantsMany plants have evolved substances, like polygodial, which prevent insects from eating, but do not kill them directly.
 The insect often remains nearby, where it dies of starvation.
 Since antifeedants are nontoxic, they would be ideal as insecticides in agriculture.
 Much agrochemical research is devoted to make them cheap enough for commercial use. needed]
  Environmental effects Effects on nontarget speciesSome insecticides kill or harm other creatures in addition to those they are intended to kill.
 For example, birds may be poisoned when they eat food that was recently sprayed with insecticides or when they mistake insecticide granules on the ground for food and eat it.[6] it.[6]
 Sprayed insecticides may drift from the area to which it is applied and into wildlife areas, especially when it is sprayed aerially.[6] aerially.[6]
  DDTMain article:
 DDT DDT
 One of the bigger drivers in the development of new insecticides has been the desire to replace toxic and irksome insecticides.
 DDT was introduced as a safer alternative to the lead and arsenic compounds. needed]
 Some insecticides have been banned due to the fact that they are persistent toxins which have adverse effects on animals and/or humans.
 An oft-quoted case is that of DDT, an example of a widely used (and maybe misused) pesticide, which was brought to public attention by Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring.
 One of the better known impacts of DDT is to reduce the thickness of the egg shells on predatory birds.
 The shells sometimes become too thin to be viable, causing reductions in bird populations.
 This occurs with DDT and a number of related compounds due to the process of bioaccumulation, wherein the chemical, due to its stability and fat solubility, accumulates in organisms' fatty tissues.
 Also, DDT may biomagnify, which causes progressively higher concentrations in the body fat of animals farther up the food chain.
 The near-worldwide ban on agricultural use of DDT and related chemicals has allowed some of these birds, such as the peregrine falcon, to recover in recent years.
 A number of the organochlorine pesticides have been banned from most uses worldwide, and globally they are controlled via the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants.
 These include:
 aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, mirex and toxaphene. needed]
  Pollinator declineInsecticides can kill bees and may be a cause of pollinator decline, the loss of bees that pollinate plants, and colony collapse disorder (CCD),[8] in which worker bees from a beehive or Western honey bee colony abruptly disappear.
 Loss of pollinators will mean a reduction in crop yields.[8] Sublethal doses of insecticides (i.e.
 imidacloprid and other neonicotinoids) affect foraging behavior of bees.[9] However, research into the causes of CCD was inconclusive as of June 2007.
 Herbicide Mode of Action Action
 To be effective, herbicides must 1) adequately contact plants; 2) be absorbedby plants; 3) move within the plants to the site of action, without being deactivated; and 4) reach toxic levels at the site of action.
 The application method used, whether preplant incorporated, preemergence, or postemergence, determines whether the herbicide will contact germinating seedlings, roots, shoots, or leaves of plants.
 The term mode of action refers to the sequence of events from absorption into plants to plant death.
 The mode of action of the herbicide influences how the herbicide is applied.
 For example, contact herbicides that disrupt cell membranes, such as acifluorfen (Blazer) or paraquat (Gramoxone Extra), need to be applied postemergence to leaf tissue in order to be effective.
 Seedling growth inhibitors, such as trifluralin (Treflan) and alachlor (Lasso), need to be applied to the soil to effectively control newly germinated seedlings.
 Soil-Applied Herbicide Activity in Plants Plants
 Because the seeds of many weed species are quite small and germinate within 0.5 to 1.0 inch of the soil surface, it is important that soil- applied herbicides be positioned in the top 1 to 2 inches of soil to be effective.
 Herbicide positioning can be accomplished by mechanical incorporation or rainfall.
 Once a herbicide comes in contact with the plant, absorption through the roots or shoots is very important.
 A herbicide that is absorbed through the roots will be taken up as long as the herbicide-treated soil remains in contact with the absorbing region near the root tips.
 As the roots grow to greater soil depths, herbicide uptake declines.
 Therefore, weeds not killed before the root tips grow out of the herbicide-treated soil are likely to survive.
 Many soil-applied herbicides are absorbed through plant shoots while they are still underground and may kill or injure the shoots before they emerge from the soil.
 Volatile herbicides such as the thiocarbamates (e.g., EPTC [Eradicane]) and the dinitroanilines (e.g., trifluralin [Treflan]) can penetrate the shoot as gases.
 Less volatile herbicides such as the acetanilides (e.g., alachlor [Lasso]) are absorbed into the shoot as liquids.
 Physical and environmental factors that promote rapid crop emergence reduce the length of time that a plant is in contact with a soil-applied herbicide and, therefore, reduce the possibility of crop injury.
 Herbicides differ in their ability to translocate (i.e., move) within a plant.
 The soil-applied dinitroaniline herbicides (e.g., trifluralin [Treflan]) are not mobile within the plant.
 Therefore, their injury symptoms are confined to the site of uptake.
 Other herbicides are mobile within the plant.
 For example, soil-applied atrazine is absorbed by plant roots and moves upward within the water transport system of the plant (i.e., xylem) to be concentrated in the leaves.
 In general, injury symptoms will be most prominent at the site where the mobile herbicides concentrate.
 Postemergence Herbicide Activity in Plants Plants
 Effective postemergence herbicide application is dependent upon adequate contact with above-ground plant shoots and leaves.
 Therefore, it is important that spray pressure and volume be adjusted for adequate plant coverage.
 Also, it is very important that the proper nozzles be used.
 Hollow-cone or flat-fan nozzles are generally recommended.
 Read the herbicide label for details.
 For postemergence herbicides, the chemical and physical relationships between the leaf surface and the herbicide often determine the rate and amount of uptake.
 Factors such as plant size and age, water stress, air temperature, relative humidity, and herbicide additives can influence the rate and amount of herbicide uptake.
 Additives such as crop oil concentrates, surfactants, or liquid fertilizer solutions (e.g., UAN) can increase herbicide uptake by a plant.
 Application of herbicides under hot and dry conditions or application to older and larger weeds or weeds under water stress can decrease the amount of herbicide uptake.
 Differences in the rate and amount of herbicide uptake influence the potential for crop injury and weed control and often explain the year to year variation in the effectiveness of the herbicide.
 Also, the faster a herbicide is absorbed by a plant, the less likely it will be that rain will wash the herbicide off the plants.
 Like soil-applied herbicides, postemergence herbicides differ in their ability to move within a plant.
 For adequate weed control, nonmobile postemergence herbicides must thoroughly cover the plant.
 Nonmobile herbicides are often called contact herbicides and include the bipyridylium, diphenylether, benzothiadiazole, and nitrile families.
 Other herbicides are mobile within the plant and can move from the site of application to their site of herbicidal activity.
 For example, growth regulator herbicides such as 2,4-D and dicamba (Banvel) move both upward and downward within a plant's food transport system (i.e., the phloem) to the growing points of the shoots and roots.
 In general, injury symptoms will be most prominent at the sites at which the mobile herbicides concentrate.
 Herbicide Selectivity Selectivity
 Plants that can rapidly degrade or deactivate a herbicide can escape that herbicide's toxic effects.
 Corn is tolerant to the triazine herbicides because it quickly deactivates these herbicides by binding them to naturally occurring plant chemicals.
 Soybean tolerance to metribuzin (Sencor, Lexone) is at least partially due to the deactivation of the herbicide by conjugating (i.e., binding) to plant sugar molecules.
 Situations may occur in which a crop may be injured by a herbicide to which it is normally tolerant.
 This often occurs because environmental stresses such as hot or cold temperatures, high relative humidity, or hail decrease a plant's natural ability to reduce herbicide uptake or deactivate a herbicide.
 Postemergence cyanazine (Bladex) injury to corn under cold and wet weather conditions is a good example of environmentally induced herbicide injury.
 An excessive application of herbicide, due to misapplication, can also injure a tolerant crop by overwhelming the crop's herbicide degradation and deactivation systems.
 Herbicide Resistance Resistance
 A number of weed species that were once susceptible and easily managed by certain herbicides have developed resistance.
 These weeds are no longer controlled by applications of previously effective herbicides.
 To date, at least 53 species of weeds are resistant to at least five different herbicide families.
 Some well-known herbicides and resistant species are presented in Table 1.
 Table 1 Herbicide classification and geographic location of weeds that have developed herbicide resistant biotypes.
 Herbicide resistance probably develops through the selection of naturally occurring biotypes of weeds exposed to a particular family of herbicides over a period of years.
 A biotype is a population of plants within the same species that has specific traits in common.
 Resistant plants survive, go to seed, and create new generations of herbicide resistant weeds.
 Mechanisms for resistance vary depending on herbicide family.
 Resistant biotypes may have slight biochemical differences from their susceptible counterparts that eliminates sensitivity to certain herbicides.
 For example, in sulfonylurea susceptible plants, a herbicide attaching or binding to an enzyme (acetlactate synthase or ALS) is responsible for disrupting amino acid biosynthesis (see Figure 1).
 Sulfonylurea herbicide resistant plants have a modified ALS enzyme that prevents herbicide binding.
 Also, while photosynthesis is inhibited in triazine herbicide susceptible biotypes, because of a slight change in a chloroplast protein, triazine resistant biotypes are able to continue normal photosynthesis upon exposure to triazine herbicides (see Figure 2).
 The potential for developing herbicide resistant biotypes is greatest when an herbicide has a single site of action (Figures 1 and 2).
 Regardless of the mechanism for resistance, becoming familiar with the herbicide mode of action can help design programs that prevent the introduction and spread of herbicide resistant weeds.
 Management programs for herbicide resistance should emphasize an integrated approach that stresses prevention.
 Dependence on a single strategy or herbicide family for managing weeds will surely increase the likelihood of additional herbicide resistance problems in the future.
 Some guidelines for an integrated approach to managing herbicide resistant weeds are given below.

 Herbicide Families Families
 An understanding of how herbicides kill weeds (i.e., herbicide mode of action) may be useful in selecting and applying the proper herbicide for a given weed control problem and for preventing herbicide resistance problems.
 Understanding herbicide mode of action is also very useful in diagnosing herbicide injury complaints.
 Although a large number of herbicides are available in the marketplace, several have similar chemical properties and herbicidal activity.
 Herbicides with a common chemistry are grouped into "families." Herbicide families are a convenient way of organizing information about herbicides.
 In addition, two or more herbicide families may have the same mode of action within the plant and thus express the same herbicide activity and injury symptoms.
 The following paragraphs describe the characteristics of widely used herbicide families grouped by their mode of action.
 These seven major modes of action are as follows:
 growth regulation, amino acid synthesis inhibition, lipid synthesis inhibition, seedling growth inhibition, photosynthesis inhibition, cell membrane disruption, and pigment inhibition.
 I.Growth Regulators Regulators
 Return to Table of Contents Contents
 The growth regulators include the following herbicide families:
 phenoxy acetic acids, benzoic acids, and the pyridines.
 Growth regulator herbicides can act at multiple sites in a plant to disrupt hormone balance and protein synthesis and thereby cause a variety of plant growth abnormalities.
 Growth regulator herbicides selectively kill broadleaf weeds; however, they are capable of injuring grass crops.
 Herbicides in this group can move in both the xylem and the phloem to areas of new plant growth.
 As a result, many herbicides in this group are effective on perennial and annual broadleaf weeds.
 Herbicide uptake is primarily through the foliage but root uptake is possible.
 Injury symptoms are most obvious on newly developing leaves.
 1.Phenoxy Acetic Acids Acids
 a.Use:
 2,4-D for small grains, corn, grass pastures, and non- cropland.
 MCPA for small grains 2,4-DB for alfalfa and soybeans soybeans
 b.Injury Symptoms:
 Broadleaf plants exhibit stem twisting (epinasty), callus tissue formation, and leaf malformations (cupping, crinkling, parallel veins, leaf strapping).
 Corn plants exhibit rolled leaves (onion-leafing), fused brace roots, stalk bending and brittleness, and missing kernels.
 Small grains exhibit twisted flag leaves, sterile florets or multiple florets.
 The amino acid synthesis inhibitors include the following herbicide families:
 sulfonylureas, imidazolinones, sulfonamide, and amino acid derivatives.
 Amino acid synthesis inhibitors act on a specific enzyme to prevent the production of specific amino acids, key building blocks for normal plant growth and development.
 Sulfonylurea, imidazolinone, and sulfonamide herbicides prevent the production of three essential branch-chain amino acids by inhibiting one key plant enzyme.
 The amino acid derivative herbicides inhibit the production of three essential aromatic amino acids by inhibiting another key plant enzyme.
 In general, injury symptoms are slow to develop (1 to 2 weeks) and include stunting or slowing of plant growth and a slow plant death.
 Herbicides in the sulfonylurea, imidazolinone, and sulfonamide families can move in both the xylem and phloem to areas of new growth and can be taken up through plant foliage and roots.
 Herbicides in these three families may have activity on annual and perennial broadleaf or grass weeds and may be soil- or foliar-applied.
 The amino acid derivative herbicides are nonselective and the site of uptake is the plant foliage.
 Herbicides in this family move via the phloem to all parts of the plant; these are excellent perennial weed control herbicides and are active on annual weeds as well.
 Grass plants may be stunted, with interveinal yellowing (chlorosis) or purpling.
 Corn plants may be stunted and show symptoms of root inhibition such as pruning of lateral roots.
 Leaves emerging from the corn whorl may not unfurl properly and may be yellow to translucent in appearance.
 Broadleaf plants may be stunted and chlorotic or purple.
 Soybean injury can range from stunting to death of the terminal growing point.
 Soybean leaves may be yellow in appearance and leaf veination may appear red or purple in color.
 Same as the imidazolinone herbicides.
 Site of Action:Acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzyme.
 Also referred to as acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS).
 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3 phosphate synthase (EPSP synthase) enzyme.
 III.Lipid Synthesis Inhibitors Inhibitors
 Return to Table of Contents Contents
 The lipid synthesis inhibitors include the following herbicide families:
 aryloxyphenoxypropionates and cyclohexanediones.
 These herbicides prevent the formation of fatty acids, components essential for the production of plant lipids.
 Lipids are vital to the integrity of cell membranes and to new plant growth.
 The lipid synthesis inhibitor herbicides inhibit a single key enzyme involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (Figure 1).
 Broadleaf plants are tolerant to these herbicide families, however, almost all perennial and annual grasses are susceptible.
 Injury symptoms are slow to develop (7 to 14 days) and appear first on new leaves emerging from the whorl of the grass plant.
 These herbicides are taken up by the foliage and move in the phloem to areas of new growth.
 Newer leaf tissue will be yellow (chlorotic) or brown (necrotic) and the leaves in the leaf whorl can be easily separated from the rest of the plant.
 The seedling growth inhibitors include the following herbicide families:
 dinitroanilines, acetanilides, and thiocarbamates.
 Seedling growth inhibitors interfere with new plant growth, thereby reducing the ability of seedlings to develop normally in the soil.
 Herbicides in these families must be soil-applied.
 Plants can take up these herbicides after germinating until the seedling emerges from the soil.
 Therefore, these herbicides are only effective on seedling annual or perennial weeds.
 Plants that have emerged from the soil uninjured are likely to remain unaffected.
 Seedling growth inhibitors are active at two main sites, the developing shoot and the root.
 Much more is known about how seedling root inhibiting herbicides work than about how seedling shoot inhibitors work.
 The root inhibitors stop plant cells from dividing, which inhibits shoot elongation and lateral root formation.
 Uptake is through developing roots and shoots.
 Because herbicide movement within the plant is limited, herbicide injury is confined primarily to plant roots and shoots.
 Shoot inhibiting herbicides are taken up by developing roots and shoots and can move via the xylem to areas of new growth.
 There is evidence to suggest that these herbicides can affect multiple sites within a plant, primarily interfering with lipid and protein synthesis.
 General symptoms include stunted plants that do not fully emerge from the soil and short, thick lateral roots.
 Grass shoots are short and thick and may appear red or purple in color.
 Broadleaf plants may have swollen and cracked hypocotyls (the area below the cotyledons).
 Following preemergence treatments, callus tissue may appear at the base of soybean stems.
  General symptoms include stunting of shoots that result in abnormal seedlings that do not emerge from the soil.
 Grasses may leaf-out underground or leaves may not properly unfurl.
 Broadleaves may have crinkled leaves and/or a shortened mid-vein, which produces a "drawstring" effect.
 General symptoms include stunting of shoots and poor emergence from the soil.
 Grasses may fail to emerge from the coleoptile or leaf-out underground.
 Leaf tips may not unfurl from the coleoptile properly, which results in the "buggy whip" effect.
 Broadleaves may have crinkled or puckered leaves or leaf buds may not open.
 c.Site of Action:
 Specific site(s) unknown, believed to have multiple sites of action.
 II.Photosynthesis Inhibitors Inhibitors
 Return to Table of Contents Contents
 The photosynthesis inhibitors include the following herbicide families:
 triazines, phenylureas, uracils, benzothiadiazoles, and nitriles.
 Photosynthesis inhibitors shut down the photosynthetic (food producing) process in susceptible plants by binding to specific sites within the plant's chloroplasts.
 Inhibition of photosynthesis could result in a slow starvation of the plant; however, the plant experiences a more rapid death that is believed to be due to the production of secondary toxic substances.
 Injury symptoms include yellowing (chlorosis) of leaf tissue followed by death (necrosis) of the tissue.
 Three of the herbicide families (triazines, phenylureas, and uracils) are taken up into the plant via the roots or foliage and move in the xylem to plant leaves.
 As a result, injury symptoms will first appear on the older leaves, along the leaf margin.
 After foliar application, triazine, phenylurea, and uracil herbicides are less mobile and do not move out of the leaf tissue.
 The nitrile and benzothiadiazole herbicide families are not mobile in plants and are classified as postemergence contact herbicides.
 These herbicides have no soil activity.
 Contact herbicides must thoroughly cover a susceptible plant's foliage if complete control is to be achieved.
 Photosynthetic inhibitors may control annual or perennial grass or broadleaf weeds.
 Photosynthesis inhibitors do not prevent seedlings from germinating or emerging.
 Injury symptoms only occur after the cotyledons and first leaves emerge.
 Initial injury symptoms include yellowing of the leaf margins or tips.
 In broadleaf plants, yellowing between the leaf veins (interveinal chlorosis) may occur.
 Older and larger leaves will be affected first because they take up more of the herbicide-water solution and they are the primary photosynthetic tissue of the plant.
 Injured leaf tissue will eventually turn brown and die.
 Due to the chemical nature of the herbicide/soil relationship, injury symptoms are likely to increase as the soil pH increases (higher than pH 7.2).
 Plant injury is confined to foliage that has come in contact with the herbicide.
 Affected leaves will become yellow or bronze in color and eventually turn brown and die.
 Injury symptoms can look similar to the injury caused by cell membrane disrupters.
 Crop oil concentrate and other additives may increase weed control and crop injury symptoms.
 Plant injury is confined to foliage that has come in contact with the herbicide.
 Foliage that has been thoroughly covered with the herbicide will turn yellow, then turn brown and die.
 Contact of a low rate of herbicide with leaves may result in spotting or speckling of the leaf surface.
 Crop oil concentrates and other additives may intensify injury symptoms.
 D-1 quinone-binding protein of photosynthetic electron transport.
 III.Cell Membrane Disrupters Disrupters
 Return to Table of Contents Contents
 The cell membrane disrupters include the diphenylether and bipyridylium herbicide families.
 These herbicides are postemergence contact herbicides that are activated by exposure to sunlight to form oxygen compounds such as hydrogen peroxide.
 These oxygen compounds destroy plant tissue by rupturing plant cell membranes.
 Destruction of cell membranes results in a rapid browning (necrosis) of plant tissue.
 On a bright and sunny day, herbicide injury symptoms can occur in 1 to 2 hours.
 Because these are contact herbicides, they are excellent for burndown of existing foliage and postemergence control of annual weeds.
 Perennial weeds usually regrow because there is no herbicide movement to underground root or shoot systems.
 These herbicides have little soil activity.
 Plant leaves will have a limp, water-soaked appearance, which is followed by browning (necrosis) of the plant tissue.
 Drift injury will appear as speckling on leaf tissue.
 Plant leaves will yellow and then turn brown and die.
 Reddish-colored spotting on the leaf surface may appear shortly after the herbicide is applied.
 Plants that do not die may be stunted for a week or more.
 Crop oils and other additives, as well as extremely cool or warm temperatures, may increase plant injury.
 c.Site of Action:
 Inhibition of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (Protox).
 V.Pigment Inhibitors Inhibitors
 Return to Table of Contents Contents
 Pigment inhibitors prevent plants from forming photosynthetic pigments.
 As a result, the affected plant parts become white to translucent.
 Clomazone (Command), a soil-applied herbicide, is the only member of the isoxazolidinone family in use at this time.
 Command is taken up by plant roots and shoots and can move in the xylem to plant leaves.
 The newly developed foliage of many plant species is so sensitive to Command that very small amounts can whiten new plant growth.
 Norflurazon (Zorial), a soil-applied herbicide, is the only member of the pyridazinone family in use at this time.
 Zorial is taken up by plant roots and moves to the growing points of susceptible plants.
 Susceptible weeds will emerge as white plants before dying.
 Phytoene and phytofluene desaturase enzymes of the terpenoid pathway.
 The problem problem
 Agricultural pests can develop resistance to fungicides, herbicides or insecticides.
 Resistance is the result of repeated use of one or more similar pesticides over a number of years.
 In Alberta, the potential exists for resistance to develop to a number of products.
 Producers should follow agronomic practices that both prevent or minimize the development of resistance and prevent the spread of existing resistant populations.
 Pest biotypes resistant to one or more chemical pesticides occur naturally.
 Repeated use of either one pesticide or of pesticides with a similar mode of action can result in a build-up of resistance and a loss of control.
 Pesticide resistant biotypes do not differ in appearance from the susceptible biotypes.
 Therefore, it is extremely difficult to observe the progression of resistance until a loss of control is observed.
 Identifying resistance resistance
 �Loss of control is observed.
 One pest may escape control while other pest species are controlled.
 �Was pesticide performance adversely affected by weather conditions or misapplication?
 �Does the field history indicate repeated use of one or more pesticides with a similar mode of action?
 �Did the pest infestation occur after pesticide application?

 The IRAC mode of action classification is considered as the definitive global authority on the target site of insecticides and crucial to this is the scientific integrity of the scheme.
 It is used globally to classify insecticides, as the basis for mode of action labelling, and is an essential tool for the development of IRM strategies involving multiple modes of action in a window-based approach.
 The MoA Team, which is largely composed of technical experts, is charged with maintaining the scheme and its status, carrying out updates as required as well as developing educational resources such as posters to promote the correct use of the scheme.
 The team considers data to support new submissions for entries to the scheme and acts as an arbiter on questions of MOA.

 CropLife Australia provides guidance for the responsible and sustainable use of pesticides is used by pests developing resistance to the pesticides pesticides
 Many crops and forests are protected from pest attacks by several applications of pesticides (mostly fungicides, insecticides or herbicides) so as to prevent economic losses of food, fibre or other plant products.
 However, regular, repeated use of certain pesticides can cause the pests to develop resistance to a particular pesticide, making the pesticide (and chemically related pesticides) ineffective.
 Pesticides belong to different chemical groups based on their �mode of action� against the pests.
 Each chemical or mode of action group may contain a number of different pesticides.
 In any pest population, there is likely to be a small number of individuals that are naturally resistant to particular pesticides, even before the pesticides are used.
 When the pesticide is used, these resistant individuals may survive and reproduce, whereas the majority of susceptible pests are killed.
 The number of resistant individuals in the population may then increase.
 Therefore, continued use of the same pesticide or chemical group will eventually result in a significant fraction of the pest population with resistance.
 Resistance arises due to overuse or misuse of a particular pesticide or chemical group, and results in the selection of populations of the pest that are resistant to that pesticide.
 In order to help pesticide users to minimize development of pest resistance, all fungicides, insecticides and herbicides sold in Australia are grouped according to their mode of action, indicated by a letter / number code on the product label.
 The mode of action labelling allows the user to identify pesticides that work by similar means (ie.
 those within a particular mode of action group) and which share a common resistance risk.
 The mode of action classification is based on grouping chemicals that control pests by the same biochemical action.
 The chemicals in one mode of action group therefore have a similar risk of the pest developing resistance to that group of chemicals.
 The resistance risk for some mode of action groups is greater than for others.
 The selection of pests for resistance to a pesticide may be slowed by limiting the exposure of a pest population to pesticides with a particular mode of action.
 This can be achieved by limiting the total number of applications of pesticides from any one mode of action group and by alternating pesticides from chemical groups with different modes of action.
 Australia was the first country to introduce compulsory mode of action labelling on pesticide products.
 The CropLife Australia website (www.croplifeaustralia.org.au) has Mode of Action tables for fungicides, insecticides and herbicides, and Resistance Management Strategies based on these to prevent or delay resistance developing.
 The website also contains some regional or crop-based Resistance Management Strategies.
 CropLife Australia's Resistance Management Strategies are also available in other publications for farmers, product distributors and others involved in the distribution, sale and use of crop protection products.
 These other publications include the �Grains Research & Development Corporation Paddock Diary� and the �Kondinin Group's Field Crop Fungicide and Insecticide Guide�.
 Some educational institutions also use these strategies within their training resources.
 The Resistance Management Strategies and Mode of Action tables for fungicides, insecticides and herbicides are revised each year by three CropLife Resistance Management Review Groups in conjunction with researchers, agronomists and farmers, and with reference to international developments.
 These Resistance Management Strategies provide growers with guidelines for pesticide use and other pest control measures (eg.
 integrated pest management or cultural techniques, such as soil cultivation to prevent weeds setting seed) for sustainable pest control and to maintain the effectiveness and availability of the pesticides.
 A good understanding of the life cycle of the pest is essential to target the best control methods.
 All crop protection products must be handled and applied strictly as specified on the product label.
 The Resistance Management Strategies do not replace product labels.
 They are a guide only and do not endorse particular products, groups of products or cultural methods in terms of their performance.
 CropLife Australia promotes good farming practice, responsible use of crop protection products and environment protection.

 The Mode of Action Classification Classification
 Insecticide resistance is becoming an increasing problem worldwide; over 500 insects are documented to be resistant to one or more insecticides.
 Although we often think of insecticide resistance as a problem in tropical areas, or in greenhouses where insects can produce many generations in a year, there have been problems with insecticide resistance in Nebraska.
 Western corn rootworms have developed resistance to insecticides twice:
 in the 1950s to persistent soil insecticides such as aldrin, dieldrin, and heptachlor and more recently, in the 1990s to foliar insecticides such as methyl parathion and carbaryl that were used to control adult corn rootworms in central Nebraska.
 Also, some greenbug populations are resistant to chlorpyrifos.
 We now have a greater diversity of types of insecticides labeled for use on Nebraska field crops than in the past.
 Understanding available modes of action of these insecticides and not repeatedly using products with the same mode of action can play an important role in reducing future problems with insecticide resistance.
 Insecticide Resistance Resistance
 Pesticide resistance may be defined as a decreased response of a population of animals or plants to a pesticide or control agent as a result of previous exposure to the pesticide.
 Resistance is different from �tolerance� which is the innate ability to survive a given toxicant dose without prior exposure and evolutionary change.
 Insecticide resistance can be thought of as �accelerated evolution� or a population responding to an intense selective pressure and survival of those individuals that possess genes conferring resistance.
 Insecticide resistance occurs as a response to insect management practices over multiple years.
 Resistance develops as a result of random mutations, producing a small number of individuals which possess traits that allow survival of normally lethal doses of insecticides.
 The insecticide itself does not produce a genetic change.
 Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) (IRAC)
 IRAC is an international industry consortium providing a coordinated response to prevent or delay the development of resistance in insect and mite pests.
 Its website (www.irac-online.org) has a great deal of additional information.
 The following text from the IRAC Website has been modified with permission.
 Mode of Action, Target Site Resistance and Cross-resistance Cross-resistance
 In most cases, not only does resistance render the selecting compound ineffective, it often also confers cross-resistance to other chemically related compounds.
 This is because compounds within a specific chemical group usually share a common target site within the pest, and thus share a common mode of action.
 For example, both carbamates such as Furadan and Sevin and organophosphates such as Lorsban and Counter, are acetylcholine inhibitors.
 Carbamates and organophosphates are subgroups with a similar mode of action.
 It is common for resistance to develop based on a genetic modification of this target site.
 When this happens, the selecting compound�s interaction with its target site is impaired and the pesticide loses its pesticidal efficacy.
 Because all compounds within the chemical sub-group share a common mode of action, there is a high risk that the resistance that has developed will automatically confer cross-resistance to all the compounds in the same sub-group.
 It is this concept of cross-resistance within chemically related insecticides or acaricides that is the basis of the IRAC mode of action classification.
 Effective IRM Strategies Use Alternations or Sequences of Different Modes of Action Action
 The objective of successful Insecticide Resistance Management (IRM) is to prevent or delay the evolution of resistance to insecticides, or to help regain susceptibility in insect pest populations in which resistance has already arisen.
 Effective IRM is an important element in maintaining the efficacy of valuable insecticides.
 It is important to recognize that it is usually easier to proactively prevent resistance from occurring than it is to reactively regain susceptibility.
 Experience has shown that all effective insecticide or acaricide resistance management strategies seek to minimize the selection for resistance from any one type of insecticide or acaricide.
 In practice, alternations, sequences, or rotations of compounds from different mode of action groups provide a sustainable and effective approach to IRM.
 This ensures that selection from compounds in any one mode of action group is minimized.
 The IRAC mode of action classification is provided as an aid to insecticide selection for these types of IRM strategies.
 The following IRM principles are recommended and endorsed by IRAC:
 Consider options for minimizing insecticide use by selecting early maturing or pest-tolerant varieties of crop plants.
 Include effective cultural and biological control practices that work in harmony with effective IRM programs.
 Adopt all non-chemical techniques known to control or suppress pest populations, including biological sprays (Bt�s), resistant varieties, within-field refuges (untreated areas), and crop rotation.
 Where possible, select insecticides and other pest management tools which preserve beneficial insects.
 Use products at their full, recommended doses.
 Reduced (sub-lethal) doses quickly select populations with average levels of tolerance, while doses that are too high may impose excessive selection pressures.
 Apply insecticides with appropriate, well-maintained equipment and use recommended water volumes, spray pressures, and optimal temperatures to obtain optimal coverage.
 Where larval stages are being controlled, target younger larval instars where possible because these are usually much more susceptible and therefore much more effectively controlled by insecticides than older stages.
 Use appropriate local economic thresholds and spray intervals.
 Where there are multiple applications per year or growing season, use alternate products with different mode of action classes.
 In the event of a control failure, do not reapply the same insecticide.
 Change the class of insecticide to one having a different mode of action and to which there is no locally known cross-resistance.
 The Mode of Action Classification Classification
 This classification was developed and endorsed by IRAC and is based on the best available evidence of the mode of action of available insecticides.
 IRAC companies have agreed to the classification details and internationally recognized industrial and academic insect toxicologists and biochemists have approved the classification.
 What is a pesticide?
 Definition and composition of a pesticide pesticide
 Usually, a pesticide is a product designed to destroy organisms deemed to be undesirable or noxious.
 End-use products contain one or several active ingredients and formulants.
 Active ingredient:
 constituting a product to which is linked the pesticide�s effect.
 The common name of the active ingredient appears on the label product under the heading �guarantee�.
 Formulant:
 any substance or group of substances other than the active ingredient that is intentionally added to a pest control product to improve its physical characteristics (e.g., sprayability, solubility, spreadability or stability).
 Contrary to active ingredients, formulants which are contained in the composition of an end-use product are not mentioned on the product label.
 Kerosene, ethanol, gelatin and soybean oil are formulants.
 To learn more about these, please consult the List of Formulants used in pesticides in Canada.
 A pesticide is designated by its common name, chemical name or commercial name.
 The common name refers to the active ingredient.
 The chemical name designates the active ingredient chemical structure name.
 The commercial name is the name given by the manufacturer.
 For example, Roundup, a commercially available product, contains formulants and an active ingredient, known under the common name "glyphosate" and under the chemical name "N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine".
 Legal definitions definitions
 In addition to their usual definition, pesticides also have a legal definition.
 These products are designated by two terms:
 "pest control products" according to the legislation at federal level, and "pesticides" at the provincial level.
 At federal level level
 At federal level, the Pest Control Products Act includes the definition of two terms, namely:
 "control product" which means any product, device, organism, substance or thing that is manufactured, represented, sold or used as a means for directly or indirectly controlling, preventing, destroying, mitigating, attracting or repelling any pest.
 "pest" which means any injurious, noxious or troublesome insect, fungus, bacterial organism, virus, weed, rodent or other plant or animal pest, and includes any injurious, noxious or troublesome organic function of a plant or animal.
 Any pest control product imported, sold or used in Canada must be registered by the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Health Canada.
 This measure applies to every active ingredient, manufacturing concentrates, as well as to all end-use products containing such ingredients.
 By the end of its registration process and before it is marketed, each product is given a sequential registration number, which must appear on its label.
 Registration process is summed up in the document The Regulation of Pesticides in Canada.
 In Canada, over 550 active ingredients are being used in some 6000 commercial products.
 You may consult their label contents by using the Search Product Label tool, created and updated by the PMRA.
 Research work can be done in using the active ingredient name, trade name or product registration number.
 In addition, certain pesticides are named biopesticides by the PMRA.
 The definition includes:
 naturally occurring or genetically altered microorganisms (microbials) (bacteria, fungus, virus, protozoan or algae) (Guidelines for the Registration of Microbial Pest Control Agents and Products); Products);
 pheromones (Guidelines for the Research and Registration of Pest Control Products Containing Pheromones and Other Semiochemicals); Semiochemicals);
 pesticides, including biochemicals, that have been accepted and registered as biopesticides by the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
 List of domestic biopesticides (French, PDF, 49 kb) kb)
 At provincial level level
 In Qu�bec, under the Pesticides Act, the word "pesticide" means any substance, matter or microorganism intended to directly or indirectly control, destroy, mitigate, attract or repel any organism that is injurious to or noxious or troublesome for humans, animal life, vegetation, crops or any other object, or intended for use as a plant growth regulator, except a vaccine or a medication other than a topical medication for external use on animals.
 It is important to know that Qu�bec legislation applies to pesticides registered by the PMRA.
 Moreover, some pest control products are not subject to Qu�bec legislation, namely:
 algicides or bactericides for swimming pools and aquariums or for the treatment of drinking water; water;
 air cleaners; cleaners;
 disinfectants; disinfectants;
 detergent additives; additives;
 mechanical or physical mechanisms, such as apparatuses to attract and destroy flying insects, ionizers for algae control in swimming pools and spas, devices to repel pests by causing physical discomfort by means of sound, touch or electromagnetic radiation.
 Although 4700 products and 450 active ingredients meet the Qu�bec pesticide definition, only 1100 products and 300 active ingredients are actually sold within the province�s territory (Account of pesticides sales in Qu�bec).
 Pesticides grouping grouping
 Usually, pesticides are named according to their grouping which takes into account the product�s target, its origin and chemical structure, how it is marketed as well as the target site and its mode of action.
 A pesticide can be grouped according to the following criteria:
 Most of the pesticides can be grouped according to their target.
 Note that the suffix �cide means "to kill".
 Category of use Targets Examples of targets targets
 Miticide Mite House dust mite mite
 Maple bladdergall mite mite
 Twospotted spider mite mite
 Avicide Birds Pigeon Pigeon
 Insecticide Insects Cockroach Cockroach
 Colorado potato beetle beetle
 Hairy chinch bug bug
 Eastern spruce budworm budworm
 Herbicide Undesirable plants Lamb�s-quarter Lamb�s-quarter
 Quack grass grass
 Poison ivy ivy
 Plantain Plantain
 Fungicide Microscopic fungi causing plant diseases Diplocarpon rosae causing rose black spot spot
 Pucciniastrum epilobii causing fir needle rust rust
 Venturia inaequalis causing apple scab scab
 Piscicide Fish White sucker sucker
 Rodenticide Rodents Rat Rat
 Mouse Mouse
 Molluscicide Terrestrial molluscs Snail Snail
 Slug Slug
 Nematicide Nematodes causing plant diseases Meloidogyne hapla causing carrot root knot knot
 Also, some pesticides� names end with the suffix �fuge which means "to repel", as in the word "insectifuge", which means "insect repellent".
 Other pesticides, which name includes �cide as a suffix, such as "ovicide", "larvicide" or "adulticide", designate substances specifically intended for destroying insects at the egg, larvae or adult stage.
 Other categories of use exist, which are:
 wood preservative; preservative;
 vaccine or anti-pest medication for external use on animals; animals;
 pruning paint; paint;
 antifouling paint; paint;
 pheromone; pheromone;
 plant growth regulator; regulator;
 animal repellent.
 Origin Origin
 Usually pesticides are grouped in two categories:
 organic and inorganic pesticides.
 Organic pesticides contain carbon, while inorganic pesticides contain carbon which can be found only under the form of carbonate or cyanide.
 These pesticides are derivatives made from arsenic, mercury, fluorine, sulphur and copper, as well as derivatives made from cyanide.
 Organic pesticides can be divided into three groups:
 synthetic pesticides (developed in laboratories and manufactured), natural pesticides (from animal, microbial or vegetal origin) and microorganisms.
 Inorganic pesticides are mostly derived from minerals.
 Chemical group group
 A chemical group is formed with pesticides which have a similar chemical structure.
 For example, the chemical structure of atrazine shown in the following diagrams allows putting this pesticide in the triazines and tetrazines group.
 Chemical groups established by the Minist�re du D�veloppement durable, de l�Environnement et des Parcs are described in the Guide for classification of pesticides by chemical group.
 Type of formulation formulation
 Pesticides are available in different formulations and can be obtained under solid, liquid or gaseous form.
 Some pesticides are marketed as ready-to-use products, in other words they do not need any special preparation before application.
 On the other hand, others do need to be prepared.
 For example, some products may need to be mixed in exact proportions with water before application.
 This mixture usually called spray mixture, is then applied on the undesirable organism.
 In this very case, preparation is diluting a concentrated product.
 Formulant examples Ready to use or to be mixed mixed
 Solid form form
 Bait Ready to use use
 Powder Ready to use use
 Wettable powder To be mixed mixed
 Liquid form form
 Spray Ready to use use
 Emulsifiable concentrate To be mixed mixed
 Solution To be mixed mixed
 Gaseous form form
 Fumigant Ready to use use
 Type of activity activity
 Herbicides, fungicides and insecticides can be designated according to their action on undesirable organisms.
 Herbicide Herbicide
 Contact Is active only on plant parts that are covered with it.
 Systemic Absorbed by the plant, this herbicide moves inside it.
 Selective Herbicide that destroys certain plants among those being under treatment.
 Non selective Controls all of the treated plants.
 R�siduaire Residual A product that breaks down slowly and controls plants over a long time.
 Non residual Action ceases quickly after application and controls plants over a short time.
 Fungicide Fungicide
 Protective Protects the plant prior the disease infection by preventing the latter to develop.
 Eradicant Fights a disease which has already developed.
 Insecticide Insecticide
 Contact Acts when insect is in contact with the product.
 Inhalation Acts when insect inhales the product.
 Ingestion Acts when insect feeds on product.
 Site or mode of action action
 Pesticides can be grouped according to the site or mode of action on the undesirable organism on which they act.
 Several sites or modes of action are known for herbicides, insecticides as well as fungicides.
 Here are some examples:
 Insecticides control insects:
 by interfering on their nervous system, or or
 by preventing moulting from the larval to the adult stage.
 Herbicides control plants:
 by inhibiting photosynthesis, or or
 by reproducing effects of plant growth regulators which they produce naturally.
 Fungicides control fungi:
 by inhibiting amino acid synthesis, or or
 by interfering with cell division.
 The list of pesticides groups constituted according the site or mode of action is available in the federal registration directive Voluntary Pesticide Resistance-Management Labelling Based on Target Site/Mode of Action.
 Glossary Glossary
 Registration:
 an administrative act authorizing the sale, importation or use of pest control products in Canada.
 Topical medication for animals:
 external use product which acts where it is applied on the animal.
 These medications relate mainly to two product ranges:
 those intended for house pets (for example, shampoo, lotion, powder, anti-flea collars and tags for dogs and cats) and those intended for livestock and cattle (for example, insecticide ear tags for cattle).
 Pheromone:
 a message-bearing substance produced by a plant or animal, or a synthetic analogue of that substance that evokes a behavioural response in individuals of the same or other species.
 EPA has completed its reregistration eligibility decisions (RED) for the heavy duty wood preservatives chromated arsenicals, pentachlorophenol, and creosote.
 In general, EPA has determined that the compounds contribute benefits to society and are eligible for reregistration provided the mitigation measures and associated label changes identified in the REDs are implemented and required data are submitted.
 In its risk assessments, the Agency identified risks of concern associated with occupational exposure (i.e., treatment plant workers) to all three preservatives and ecological exposure to pentachlorophenol and creosote.
 Chromated copper arsenate (CCA) is a chemical wood preservative containing chromium, copper and arsenic.
 CCA is used in pressure treated wood to protect wood from rotting due to insects and microbial agents.
 EPA has classified CCA as a restricted use product, for use only by certified pesticide applicators.
 CCA has been used to pressure treat lumber since the 1940s.
 Since the 1970s, the majority of the wood used in outdoor residential settings has been CCA-treated wood.
 Pressure treated wood containing CCA is no longer being produced for use in most residential settings, including decks and playsets.
 The Agency has completed its reregistration eligibility decision (RED) and will continue to work with stakeholders to implement its decision.
 Pesticide manufacturers to voluntarily phased out certain CCA use for wood products around the home and in children's play areas.
 Effective December 31, 2003, no wood treater or manufacturer may treat wood with CCA for residential uses, with certain exceptions.

 Coatings (Sealant) Studies Studies
 EPA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) conducted two-year studies (August 2003-August 2005) of the effectiveness of coatings in preventing leaching of arsenic from CCA-treated wood.
 Both studies examined whether or not the application of different wood sealants on CCA-treated wood affects the amount of CCA residues to which an individual may be exposed.
 The data suggest that application of penetrating stains and coatings to decks or other residential CCA-treated structures at least once a year can reduce potential exposure to arsenic.
 CPSC released its draft final report in October 2006.
 EPA�s Science Advisory Panel (SAP) submitted its final report on the EPA and CPSC studies in January 2007.
 The data demonstrate the SAP report suggested more definitive studies are needed.
 They also invited the coatings industry to develop products with specific characteristics intended to reduce dislodgeable arsenic.

 Creosote is a wood preservative used for commercial purposes only; it has no registered residential uses.
 Creosote is obtained from high temperature distillation of coal tar (itself a mixture of hundreds of organic substances), and over 100 components in creosote have been identified.
 It is used as a fungicide, insecticide, miticide, and sporicide to protect wood and is applied by pressure methods to wood products, primarily utility poles and railroad ties.
 EPA reassessed creosote as part of its reregistration program for older pesticides.
 The Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) for creosote was signed on September 25, 2008.
 Federal law directs EPA to periodically reevaluate older pesticides to ensure that they continue to meet current safety standards.

 This document provides a general overview of human toxicity and a cross reference of chemical, common, and trade names of common wood treatment pesticides registered for use in Florida.
 This guide summarizes some of the more commonly-used wood preservatives.
 General General
 Florida has a more hazardous environment for the life of wood than any other state in the U.S.
 Wood preservatives are applied to finished and unfinished wood products for protection against decay organisms and boring insects.
 Treating wood is not a new concept, as the Greeks poured oil into bored holes to preserve pillars supporting buildings.
 Impregnating wood with chemicals using vacuum and pressure processes began in 1831 with the French, and many chemicals have been tested for the wood-preserving activity.
 In spite of the long history, there are relatively few chemicals suitable for wood preservation.
 There are several miscellaneous chemicals used in wood treatment not listed in this guide, but there are 3 main groups of wood preservatives today:
 coal tar creosote, a group known collectively as the inorganic arsenicals, and pentachlorophenol.
 Inorganic Arsenicals Arsenicals
 Chromated copper arsenate (CCA) was, by far, the most widely-used wood preservative in the U.S.
 Its uses as a commercial preservative began during the 1940s.
 There are three types of CCA, and at times, these may have been used interchangeably.
 These are CCA types A, B, and C.
 The difference among them arises in the relative contents of chromium trioxide, copper oxide, and arsenic that each contain.
 Some uses of wood preservatives containing CCA have been discontinued for wood products intended for residential building and consumer products.
 EPA determined that CCA posed unreasonable human health risks and discontinued certain residential uses at the end of 2003.
 Many of its industrial uses are still available.
 Examples of industrial uses that remain registered for CCA use include marine timbers and pilings, utility poles, and plywood roof decking.
 Ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate (ACZA) is similar to CCA, but chromate is not its fixing agent.
 It is made water-soluble by adding ammonia.
 After wood is treated, the ammonia and water portions evaporate, resulting in water-insoluble copper arsenate in the wood.
 Developed in the 1920s, it is more commonly used in the western U.S.
 for treating Douglas fir and other species that are difficult to treat.
 During the 1980s, the product was improved with the addition of zinc oxide.
 The inorganic arsenicals, as a group, are advantageous in that they do not produce smell or vapors and surfaces that have been treated with them may be painted.
 Several disadvantages also exist, however, in that unless wood is re-dried after treatment, warping and cracking may occur.
 Additionally, these compounds don't protect wood from excessive weathering.
 Coal Tar Creosote Creosote
 Coal tar creosote is a brownish-black oily substance that has a �smoky� odor.
 It is produced as a byproduct in the production of coke, which is produced from coal and used in the manufacturing of steel.
 Creosote products were probably the first group of wood preservatives entering the commercial market.
 Because of its thick, oily consistency, it does not readily penetrate wood at ordinary temperatures.
 A process invented in 1838, known as �pressure-treating,� allows creosote to penetrate wood.
 Creosote along with the pressure-treating process was instrumental in the development of the U.S.
 It is used mainly to treat railroad ties, but is also used in the treatment of large timbers, fence posts, poles, and pilings.
 An advantage of creosote is that it is insoluble in water; disadvantages include its strong odor, tendency to exude from surfaces, and it can't be used in homes or other living areas because of its fumes.
 Pentachlorophenol Pentachlorophenol
 Pentachlorophenol, also known as �penta� or PCP, had its wood preserving properties discovered in the 1930s.
 After the EPA cancelled its uses as a defoliant, disinfectant, herbicide, and mossicide, the commercial wood-preserving uses were restricted in 1987.
 It is usually dissolved in petroleum or other organic solvents that allows it to adequately penetrate wood.
 At times, it is added to creosote to enhance preserving effectiveness.
 Most commercial uses of PCP are used to treat utility poles and crossarms for utility poles.
 It has no residential uses.
 Advantages of PCP are that it can be dissolved in oils having a wide range of viscosity, vapor pressure and color, and it is easy to handle and use.
 Disadvantages are that it does not provide protection as well as creosote, it's not suitable for use in living areas, and it is toxic and irritating to plants, animals, and people.
 Toxicity Toxicity
 Wood preservatives are pesticides that protect wood from decay and insects; therefore they must be toxic to be effective.
 Applicators that do the treating of wood are most subject to exposure and those who use the products are much less likely to suffer exposure.
 Because of this, it's especially important for applicators to take precautionary measures to minimize their risk of exposure.
 Exposure to these chemicals can occur during the mixing process, handling operations, entering treatment cylinders, working around spraying or dipping operations, handling freshly-treated wood products, cleaning or repairing equipment, or disposing of chemical wastes.
 These are like other pesticides in regards to routes of exposure:
 oral ingestion, dermal or eye absorption, and inhalation of vapors into the respiratory tract.
 Because most wood preservatives have a strong odor and taste, ingestion is very unlikely.
 The more likely exposure routes are through skin contact or inhalation of vapors; consequently, many of these products' labels will contain precautionary measures regarding suitable personal protective equipment, including respirators.
 Products within all three of these major groupings of wood preservatives carry the signal word, DANGER, on their labels and are classified as restricted use pesticides.
 The product labels provide basic first aid instructions, as do the Material Safety Data Sheets supplied by distributors.
 Inorganic Arsenicals Arsenicals
 Acute effects of exposure to high concentrations of inorganic arsenicals can cause nausea, headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, if ingested.
 Prolonged exposure can produce persistent headaches, abdominal distress, salivation, low-grade fever, and upper respiratory irritation.
 Long-term exposure can cause liver damage, loss of hair and fingernails, anemia, and skin disorders.
 Chronic effect studies with laboratory animals indicate that it causes genetic effects.
 It has been shown to be associated with cancer in people who either drink water or breathe air contaminated with arsenic.
 There are no literature citations regarding adverse environmental effects.
 Arsenate is strongly adsorbed on soil and is largely unavailable for plant uptake or leaching into groundwater.
 Coal Tar Creosote Creosote
 Creosote can acutely cause skin irritation, burns, or dermatitis.
 Its vapors are irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract, and ingestion can cause nausea and abdominal distress.
 Chronic animal studies indicate that it is a carcinogen, and it has been associated with skin cancer in some occupationally exposed workers.
 The presence of creosote or other phenolic compounds in the human body will impart a dark, smoky color to the urine.
 Other laboratory animal studies indicate that it is a mutagen.
 There are statements on individual product labels which convey these potential effects.
 There are no known injuries to wild animals involving creosote.
 Although small amounts of creosote may enter the environment, most of it is quickly biodegraded.
 Pentachlorophenol Pentachlorophenol
 Pentachlorophenol is irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract.
 Ingestion or excessive dermal or inhalation exposure can lead to fever, headache, weakness, dizziness, nausea, and profuse sweating.
 The exact amount required to produce human illness is unknown.
 Skin penetration is the most common route of exposure.
 Prolonged high exposure levels can lead to an acne-like skin condition or other skin disorders; it may also cause damage to the liver, kidneys, and nervous system.
 Product labels note that it is restricted in use due to fetotoxicity and oncogenicity in laboratory animals.
 This chemical is extremely toxic to fish and exposure to concentrations in the parts-per-billion range can cause death of fish.
 Because the major uses of PCP don't involve soil applications, any concentrations detected in soil would most likely be due to bleeding of the preservative from treated wood.
 Accumulation in plants and animals is unlikely because it's not translocated in plants and it's rapidly eliminated by mammals following exposure.
 Insects and mold can damage wood over time.
 To prevent that damage, wood is often treated with pesticides.
 Treated wood is commonly used to build telephone poles, road signs and marine pilings as well as decks, play structures and raised garden beds.
 Several wood preservatives are registered with the EPA, each with different uses and potential risks.
 Wood preservatives can extend the life of wood and reduce the need for forest resources, but proper use is important.
 Some preservatives can slowly leach into the surrounding soil or water.
 Sometimes, touching the wood can leave residue on exposed skin.
 Use the resources below to learn about selecting and using treated wood properly.
 When using treated wood, keep these tips in mind:
 �Make sure you select the proper type of treated wood for the job.
 Some treated wood and wood preservatives are restricted to specific uses.
 �Consider wearing gloves when handling unsealed treated wood to reduce exposure to your skin.
 �Consider wearing a dust mask while cutting treated wood to help prevent treated sawdust from being inhaled.
 Even untreated wood can irritate a person's airways.
 �Never burn treated wood.
 Toxic chemicals can be released in the smoke.
 �Consider using paint, varnish or some other type of sealant on treated wood as a barrier between the chemical and the surrounding environment.
 �Some wood preservatives can leach into soil and be taken up by plants.
 If you are planning to use treated wood close to edible plants, consider reviewing the resources below or talking to a NPIC specialist about ways to minimize the risks of treated wood.

 Beyond Pesticides has focused on the heavy-duty wood preservatives, namely the inorganic arsenicals (such as chromated copper arsenate, or CCA), pentachlorophenol (penta) and creosote, since the early 1980s.
 The heavy-duty wood preservatives rank with the most deadly chemicals on the market.
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified all of the chemicals, as well as their contaminants, as known or probable carcinogens.
 It remains the policy of Beyond Pesticides to work towards a complete ban on the use of these extremely toxic and obsolete chemicals through watchdogging EPA, working with legislators, and providing technical assistance to grassroots.
 EPA is currently working through the reregistration process with the heavy-duty wood preservatives.
 That process began in the mid-1990s.
 EPA is on record stating that Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) documents (the culmination of reregistration) would be complete in 1998.
 The agency currently claims that the REDs will be available in 2003.
 EPA released it's revised risk assessment of these chemicals in April 2008.
 In 1978 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated a Rebuttable Presumption Against Reregistration, now called Special Review, a process evaluating the risks and benefits of the heavy-duty wood preservatives.
 Only chemicals that trigger serious health and environmental concerns are placed in this expedited Special Review and EPA set a four-year timeline.
 EPA initiated the risk assessment based on the following health effects:
 Inorganic arsenicals - oncogenicity (causes cancerous tumors), mutagenicity (causes genetic damage), fetotoxicity (kills developing babies) and other reproductive effects effects
 Pentachlorophenol (or its contaminants dioxins, furans and hexachlorobenzene) - oncogenicity, teratogenicity (causes birth defects) and fetotoxicity fetotoxicity
 Creosote - oncogenicity and mutagenicity mutagenicity
 The process was not complete until 1986, four years behind schedule.
 The outcome was far from satisfactory from a human and environmental health perspective.
 EPA allowed the continued use of all of the heavy-duty wood preservatives.
 Since the mid-1980s, Beyond Pesticides has worked with elected officials and regular citizens, as well as the press to educate people about the extreme risks associated with exposure to these pesticides.
 We have published numerous articles in our quarterly newsletter Pesticides and You, as well as timely action alerts, providing updates on EPA's actions, current legislative efforts and information about the toxicology of the wood preservatives.
 Collecting and disseminating stories about victims of exposure to wood preservatives specifically and pesticides generally is one of our more important projects.
 Please share your own story with us by filling out a Pesticide Incident Report (PIR) form.
 Beyond Pesticides has published two reports addressing the risks of exposure to these chemicals.
 Our first report, Poison Poles, published in 1997 examines the toxic trail left by the manufacture, use, storage and disposal of the heavy-duty wood preservatives from cradle to grave.
 Pole Pollution, published in 1999, focuses on EPA's draft preliminary science chapter on penta and provides the results of our survey of over 3,000 utilities across the United States and Canada.
 Both EPA's science chapter and our survey provide shocking numbers.
 For example, EPA has calculated that children face a 220 times increase in the risk of cancer from exposure to soil contaminated with penta leaching out of the utility poles.
 Those utility poles are ubiquitous across our country.
 We also found that over 68 percent of utilities are in the habit of given away discarded utility poles that continue to leach toxic chemicals into the environment to the public.
 Inadequate chemical restrictions and failure to consider alternative materials materials
 regulatory action on wood preservatives is best characterized by a series of missteps and backpedaling.
 The risk-benefit standard in the Federal Insecticid,e Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) empowers the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow high levels of risk based on assumptions about a chemical's benefit.
 At the same time, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulates wood preserving plants and treated wood waste with a series of exemptions and standards that allow for high levels of contamination.
 Environmental Stewardship Stewardship
 Meanwhile, EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs has launched a Pesticide Environmental Stewardship program.
 In participation with federal agencies, "groups or companies agree that environmental stewardship is an integral part of pest management practices." Although a number of utility companies have agreed to a set of principles with non-specific risk reduction goals and undefined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) management of power line rights-of way, no attention has been focused on the utilities as a major user of wood preservative-treated utility poles.
 The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Because EPA does not operate with a "bright line" standard of unacceptable hazards and attributes benefits to chemicals without fully evaluating the availability of nonchemical strategies, the agency is constantly putting the public at unnecessary risk.
 Furthermore, because EPA does not consider the full range of adverse effects from a chemical's cradle to grave, from manufacturing to use to disposal, the full extent of the chemical's hazards are not analyzed.
 It was 1978 when EPA began its review of wood preservatives because of serious concerns about the public health and environmental threat that these chemicals represent.
 At that time, the agency put the chemicals into a special review process, then Rebuttable Presumption Against Registration (RPAR).
 Only chemicals that trigger serious health and environmental concerns are placed into this faster track review.
 However, instead of moving expeditiously to begin removing uses of these chemicals from the market, the agency delayed.
 A review timeline set by EPA at four years in 1978 was extended to over eight years ending in 1986.
 Over that period, EPA reversed itself and softened its approach under tremendous pressure and legal challenges from the chemical and wood preserving industry.
 The original proposals for chemical restriction became progressively weaker over the years.
 When EPA completed its review and negotiations with the wood preserving and chemical industry in 1986, it did not specifically regulate wood poles, but did regulate the use of wood preservatives.
 Moreover, as a part of this review, EPA did not evaluate the cradle to grave considerations.
 Because EPA identified extraordinarily high risk to human health from the most widely used wood preservatives, the agency began a regulatory review process which evaluated the acceptability of their continued use.
 The agency on October 18, 1978 initiated what at the time was called a Rebuttable Presumption Against Registration, now called Special Review.
 This is a process during which EPA evaluates the risks and the benefits of the pesticides in question.
 EPA initiated action based on the following health triggers:
 creosote - for oncogenicity (cancer) and mutagenicity (genetic damage).
 pentachlorophenol (or its contaminants) - for oncogenicity, teratogenicity (birth defects) and fetotoxicity.
 inorganic arsenicals (including copper chromated arsenate) - for oncogenicity, mutagenicity, reproductive effects and fetotoxicity.
 EPA set a timetable in which it announced an expected final regulatory decision by the middle of 1980.
 However, the process did not conclude until six years after that date and major issues are still not resolved.
 When EPA began its review process in 1978, it began an evaluation of wood preservative benefits that assumed the need for these chemicals because of their widespread use.
 As a result, the review process lacked credibility because it did not evaluate the viability of alternatives, including alternative materials to treated wood.
 The National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides' (NCAMP) review of the Special Review process in Unnecessary Risks resulted in an indictment of the benefits review process.
 The process assumes the benefits of poisons that are routinely and widely used, like wood preservatives, despite significant risk to human life and the environment and regardless of safer alternatives.
 Furthermore, EPA does not have a process to revisit the issue of new, safer alternative technologies, materials or approaches that emerge, thus challenging assumptions of the need for a chemical.
 The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences notes that:
 Formal benefits assessments are conducted only during this [Special] review and do not generally contain detailed economic analyses of alternative nonchemical or IPM [Integrated Pest Management] strategies.
 The effect of this practice is to assume that the economic value of nonchemical or integrated control strategies is near zero.
 Consequently, the benefits assessments tend to overstate the economic benefits of the individual pesticide under review as well as the impact of pesticide cancellation.
 EPA issued a preliminary notice of determination concluding the RPAR for the wood preservatives in 1981.
 In this document, EPA proposed to adopt what it called "risk-reduction measures which are cost effective and which will reduce risk by a significant amount." Here again, the agency attributed irreplaceable benefits to wood preservatives, almost across-the-board, that rationalized continued use.
 In its position document, EPA wrote, "Due to the non-substitutability of the wood preservative compounds and the lack of acceptable non-wood or other chemical alternatives for many use situations, the economic impact which would result from an across-the-board cancellation would be immense." The agency does not reference alternative materials, just alternative chemicals.
 The data base for the alternative wood preservatives is so deficient as to disallow a definitive assessment of the risks associated with the use of the alternative wood preservatives.
 However, there is suggestive evidence to indicate that the acute toxicity of TBTO and Cu-8 may be unacceptable for unrestricted use.
 Similarly, the data for CZC, ACC, Cu-8, 2,4,5-TCP, 2,4,6-TCP and 2,3,4,6-Tetra indicate potential long term adverse effects.
 The toxicological potential of copper napthenate and zinc naphthenate cannot be assessed on the basis of a few acute toxicology studies in which LD50 [lethal effects that kills half the test population] values could not be determined.
 In conclusion, from a safety point of view, the alternatives do not appear to be preferable to the RPAR wood preservatives.
 The agency's proposed risk-reduction measures would have changed the terms and conditions of the chemicals' registration in the following ways:
 cancel spray penta products available for retail sale in concentrations of 5% or less;.
 classify some products for restricted use (only available to certified applicators or those operating under their supervision); supervision);
 require protective clothing and equipment; equipment;
 prohibit eating, drinking, and smoking while applying wood preservatives; preservatives;
 require proper care and disposal of work clothing and equipment; equipment;
 require a closed mixing and a closed emptying system for all prilled (granular) formulations of penta, powder and prilled (granular) formulations of sodium penta and the powder formulations of the inorganic arsenicals; arsenicals;
 prohibit indoor applications of the wood preservatives; preservatives;
 prohibit the use of pesticide-treated wood indoors, except for a few low exposure uses; uses;
 prohibit applications of the wood preservative pesticides in a manner which may result in direct exposure to domestic animals or livestock, or in the contamination of food, feed, or drinking an irrigation water; and, and,
 require control technologies to reduce arsenic surfaces residues on the treated wood.
  EPA announced final action in 1984, now six years into its process of review, deliberation and negotiation.
 Despite all this effort, the action was immediately challenged by wood preservation trade associations and user groups, who requested an administrative hearing.
 As a result, EPA action was enjoined for another year.
 The notice proposed the following:
 restricts sale and use of wood preservatives to certified applicators; applicators;
 starts a mandatory consumer awareness program, Consumer Information Sheets will accompany pressure-treated wood ; ;
 requires gloves, protective clothing, and respirators (when entering cylinders or opening cylinder doors), dust masks for high levels of inorganic arsenicals; arsenicals;
 limits immediately the level of dioxin contamination in penta to 15 ppm [parts per million], and to one ppm within 18 months; and, and,
 label changes, to include protective clothing statements, can't be applied inside or to wood intended to be inside, no eating, drinking, or smoking while applying.
 During the period July, 1984 to September, 1985, EPA negotiated with the trade and user groups, resulting in a weakening the original final action.
 Changes in the settlement include:
 mandatory consumer awareness program was shifted to Volunteer consumer awareness program; program;
 under this voluntary program, an annual survey will be conducted by American Wood Preservers Institute (AWPI) and Society of American Wood Preservers (SAWP), not EPA, as originally proposed; and, and,
 EPA has the right to inspect the survey records for two years.
 This settlement agreement finalized EPA action on wood preservatives, "except that registrants of penta wood preservative products who .
 reserved the right to request a hearing on the Agency's requirements for maximum certified limits for HxCCD [dioxin] and other contaminants or on the requirements for verification of such limitations set forth in the amended Notice." Notice."
 The EPA proposal to limit dioxin contamination in penta was challenged by chemical manufacturers following the agency's issuance of the July, 1984 Notice of Intent to Cancel, which included an allowable 1 ppm (parts per million) of dioxin contamination.
 The two companies involved in this proceeding included Vulcan Materials Company and Idacon, Inc.
 Under pressure, EPA agreed to raise the dioxin levels by 4 times to 4 ppm in some cases.
 EPA reached a settlement on November 7, 1986 which accomplished the following:
 changes the levels of hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HxCDD) from the original notice (lower the level to 15 ppm immediately, 1 ppm in 18 months) to:
 immediately 15 ppm; ppm;
 in one year, no batch will contain more than 6 ppm, but the average will not exceed 3 ppm; and, and,
 in 2 years, no batch will exceed 4 ppm, average will not exceed 2 ppm ppm
 results must be analyzed and reported to EPA monthly.
 EPA has not acted on the use of wood preservatives since 1986.
 According to EPA staff, although the wood preservatives are undergoing reregistration along with hundreds of other pesticides, the issue has been "backburnered" as EPA focuses on food use pesticides.
 1987 1987
 In announcing its January 2, 1987 Final Determination and Notice of Intent to Cancel and Deny Application for Registrations of Pesticide Products Containing Pentachlorophenol (including but not limited to its salts and esters) for nonwood uses, EPA said, said,
 The Agency is concerned about the ubiquity of pentachlorophenol, its persistence in the environment, its fetotoxic and teratogenic properties, its presence in human tissues, and its oncogenic risks from the presence of dioxins in the technical material.
 Where in the World is Pentachlorophenol Banned?
 From-Pesticide Action Network, "1995 Demise of the Dirty Dozen," and United Nations, "Consolidated List of Products Whose Consumption and/or Sale Have Been Banned, Withdrawn, Severely Restricted or Not Approved By Governments," Fifth Issue, 1994.
 Failure to Consider the Alternatives to Treated Wood Poles Poles
 EPA allows the continued use of these hazardous materials despite the availability of alternatives to wood poles.
 The range of economically viable alternatives include recycled steel, concrete, and fiberglass poles, and burying lines.
 In 1995, Canada took up the issue of wood preservative use with the establishment of a Strategic Options Process (SOP) for the Wood Preservation Sector.
 Environment Canada recognized that the availability of alternatives may have changed since this issue was evaluated in the 1980s and therefore launched a study to "rank the feasible alternatives to products that are made from creosote-, CCA-, ACA-, or pentachlorophenol-treated wood." According to a memorandum describing the review, "Alternative products may be wood treated with other pesticides, products made from materials other than wood, or alternative practices." Alternatives to be considered include steel, concrete, aluminum, fiberglass, plastics and composites.
 The Resource Conservation and Resource Recovery Act (RCRA) (RCRA)
 Under RCRA, arsenical treated wood waste has been exempted from the hazardous waste designation and creosote or pentachlorophenol levels in waste wood fall below the agency's defined hazard threshold, known as a Toxicity Characteristic.
 As a result, treated wood waste circumvents regulations that would require disposal in hazardous waste landfills.
 This means that unless a state government acts, the treated wood may end up in an unprotected municipal landfill.
 The state of California has set levels for residues of wood preservatives in wood that are more stringent than the federal government.
 According to the state, tests have shown that wood preserved with pentachlorophenol, arsenic, chromium and copper fail the states Total Threshold Limit Concentration (TTLC), making the wood hazardous waste.
 However, a 1995 state law, AB 1965, specially exempts treated wood waste removed from electric, gas, or telephone service.
 While the treated wood waste is defined as hazardous, the law exempts it from being managed as hazardous waste if certain disposal management practices are used.
 Even prior to this law, the state had issued variances for the major utility in the state, PG&E, allowing the reuse, handling, and disposal of treated wood poles as nonhazardous waste, and permitting disposal in non-Class I hazardous waste landfills.
 Nevertheless, the state requires the disposal for wood wastes treated with creosote, penta and arsenicals in municipal landfills that:
 contain a composite-lined portion; portion;
 are approved by the Regional Water Quality Control Board; Board;
 do not allow scavenging of the waste; and, and,
 prohibit burning of such waste.
 PG&E says it saves $500,000 a year by sidestepping the hazardous waste management designation.
 The costs associated with managing hazardous waste include:
 filing a notice of hazardous waste generation or an application to store, treat and dispose of hazardous waste if material is held for more than 90 days; a manifest or recordkeeping system; the use of only registered haulers; and, possible standards testing.
 Other states have adopted similar laws to California.
 Both Washington and Oregon, while defining the treated wood waste as hazardous, have excluded it from hazardous waste management requirements with stipulations that the disposal occurs in landfills with leachate collection systems.
 Regarding waste generated by wood treatment plants, EPA is currently working on Land Disposal Restrictions which will regulate wastes, such as sludge and other wastes from wood preserving plants, as hazardous waste.
 Regulations are due out by April, 1997.
 A similar effort by regulators in California was stopped by legislators in that state.
 Arsenic-Treated Wood [ Print Version ] ]
 Arsenic-treated wood is the result of a chemical process in which wood is treated with a pesticide/preservative called chromated copper arsenate (CCA) to prevent rotting in lumber designed for outdoor use.
 CCA contains arsenic, chromium, and copper and was widely used for residential purposes in the United States from the 1970s until EPA phased it out in 2003.
 CCA-treated wood can be hazardous to human health because arsenic is classified as a known carcinogen.
 Exposure to arsenic can cause cancer of the lung, bladder, skin, kidney, prostate, and nasal passage.
 Data released in November 2003 by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) show that 90 percent of children repeatedly exposed to arsenic-treated wood face a greater than one-in-one million risk of cancer.
 (One-in-one million is the EPA�s historic threshold of concern about the carcinogenic effects of toxic chemicals.) Arsenic exposure can also lead to nerve damage, dizziness, and numbness.
 Arsenic has been linked to immune diseases, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and changes in hormone function.
 Lung and bladder cancer are the two health effects most often related to exposure to CCA-treated wood.
 For information on other cancer risks in the home environment, please see Cancer Risks.
 CCA-treated wood can be found virtually anywhere outdoor lumber is being utilized.
 Due to the increased risk to children, the uses currently receiving the most attention are play sets, decks, and picnic tables.
 Arsenic can leach to the surface of the treated wood, becoming accessible for absorption through exposed hands and skin touching the wood surface and, especially in the case of children, ingestion through normal hand-to-mouth behavior.
 The arsenic can also leach into the ground surrounding the location of the treated wood, providing yet another exposure pathway for children playing in the area.
 Government and public attention to the issue of health hazards from CCA-treated wood, both national and international, has been growing steadily over the past few years.
 In March 2003, EPA finalized a voluntary agreement with preservative manufacturers to ban the production of CCA-treated wood for most residential uses as of December 31, 2003.
 However, the ban does not prohibit the sale of CCA-treated wood produced prior to December 31, 2003, nor does the measure address existing structures.
 With regard to retail sales, a warning label must be displayed in locations where CCA-treated wood is sold.
 The EPA has also removed chromated copper arsenate from its list of approved chemical pesticides.
 The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is also involved in the regulation of arsenic-treated wood.
 The CPSC has officially stated that there is an increased lifetime risk of developing lung or bladder cancer from exposure to arsenic for the individual who plays on CCA-treated wood play sets during early childhood.
 However, in November 2003, CPSC declined to ban the use of CCA-treated wood in playground equipment, citing the EPA-industry voluntary agreement to phase out the manufacture of CCA-treated wood.
 In research that is still underway, the EPA and CPSC are studying whether wood sealants could effectively prevent arsenic from leaching out CCA-treated wood.
 Informed individuals need not wait for government action on CCA application.
 Alternatives do exist to using arsenic-treated wood in new construction, and there are recommendations to reduce exposure from existing structures.
 When purchasing new materials, some of the available alternatives include wood treated with non-arsenic preservatives; wood that does not require pressure-treatment; and non-wood alternatives such as metal, cement, and plastic.
 The pros and cons for such alternatives (other potentially hazardous chemical treatments, sustainable harvesting, durability, etc.) should be examined prior to making a purchasing decision.
 A company called Timber Treatment Technologies announced in April 2006 that a new wood treatment process will replace CCA and other pesticide wood treatments in wood used for decks, porches, fences, and other outdoor home-related structures.
 The new treatment process, called TimberSil, uses a sodium silicate solution, which is infused into the wood.
 The solution, which is essentially a type of liquid glass, and the wood are heated, rendering the solution water insoluble.
 This creates a barrier and makes the wood inedible to insects, microbes, and molds.
 When dealing with existing structures that cannot be replaced, general recommendations include applying a sealant to the wood at least once a year; washing hands after coming into contact with arsenic-treated wood, particularly before eating; avoiding toy storage under arsenic-treated decks; keeping children and pets away from dirt beneath and surrounding arsenic-treated materials, as rains can transfer leached arsenic to these locations; and not eating at an arsenic-treated picnic table.
 In our experience, the best customer is a well-informed customer.
 We also do our best to answer customers questions honestly and directly.
 Here are some of the common questions we get asked about Injector Plugs.
 If you don�t see your question here, please feel free to write to us at ask@injectsolutions.com.
 Are Injector Plugs only installed in wood?
 What about other materials?
 The IPexterior plug can be used in wood from a thickness of 3/4" to 2" in thickness.
 The IPinterior plug is a "molly" design which enables it to be used in thinwall applications such as Formica or interior drywalls.
 It is designed for materials from 1/8" to 2 1/2" in thickness.
 How do you inject the treatments into the plug?
 Is it safe?
 Every plug has a 3/8" hollow core through which you can inject pest control chemicals or wood preservative.
 Once a treatment has been applied, the decorative cap can be placed on top of the Injector Plug until the next treatment, and yes, it is both child and pet safe.
 What kinds of chemicals do you use?
 We provide the Injector Plugs only.
 We do not provide the chemicals.
 You purchase the manufacturers chemicals of your choice for the problem you�re trying to solve - usually in powder, liquid, or granular form.
 Common pests, like carpenter ants, termites and powder post beetles, generally thrive on wood structures, particularly wood that also has high moisture content.
 That�s why we often recommend treating problem areas with a wood preservative, followed by a pest control treatment.
 Can I use the same plug for different problems?
 Once the plug is installed, you can use it for multiple purposes, including insects, rodents, odors, wood rot, smoke damage and more.
 We often recommend treating problem areas with a wood preservative, followed by a pest control treatment.
 Where and how do I install the plugs?
 Installation is simple.
 Just drill a 1" hole and install the appropriate plug.
 The IPexterior is used in wood or other solid materials, and requires a minmum of 3/4" material thickness.
 The IPinterior only requires 1/8" of material thickness.
 The plugs are designed with a 1/2" square hole at the head which accepts a 1/2" square ratchet drive and a short extension which makes it easy to drive both plugs into position and ready for use.
 Generally you will need to install one plug every six feet.
 I hear noises in my walls and ceilings, what can I do?
 I recommend installing the Injector Plugs as close to the problem area as possible.
 If you�re not sure what kind of infestation you have, you can apply one type of treatment (e.g., for mice) and then, if the problem persists, try a different treatment (e.g., for ants or termites) using the same plugs.
 I live in a two family home and I hear something running around in my floors.
 How can I solve this problem?
 You can easily install an Injector Plug in the floor of a closet or other out of the way place.
 Once you have installed the plug you can inject the appropriate treatment of baits and your pesticides of choice.
 I have exterior wood columns on my home and we cannot keep paint on them.
 This problem typically occurs because the columns have not been treated with wood preservative on the inside (or core) of the hollow column.
 This allows moisture to be wicked from the inside to the outside of the column, where it then causes the paint to flake away from the wood.
 You can treat the problem by installing an IPexterior plug approximately 8" down from the top of each column (note:
 if column wall is less than 3/4" thick you may use the IPinterior plug).
 Inject a clear wood preservative into the column, using as much pressure as possible to disperse the liquid.
 This should be repeated several times over the period of two days to allow individual treatments to fully penetrate the wood.
 Once the wood preservative has fully dried we also recommend that you inject a pesticide into the column to protect against carpenter ants and termites.
 I have big ants around my kitchen and floor, what can I do to get rid of them?
 You may have a nest of Carpenter ants under your cabinets.
 A good start is to install one plug under your kitchen sink (in or near the toe kick), and from there, install one plug every 4' on either side of the sink cabinet.
 The trim at my front and back doors is beginning to show signs of peeling paint and rot.
 How do I prevent more damage?
 Cut approximately one-quarter inches from the bottom of the casing to prevent additional water from wicking into the trim.
 If the trim is setting directly on the ground or on masonry, cut approximately 1/2" from the bottom.
 Locate Injector Plugs about eight inches above the floor height and three inches to the side of the trim on each area that is having a problem.
 Inject two or three good doses of the clear preservative over a period of two or three days, letting the materials dry for a day or so between applications.
 Then inject the appropriate pesticide to prevent any pest problems, install the plug cap and you�re done.
 You can then refinish the trim.
 What if I have aluminum or vinyl siding on my home?
 In the case of aluminum or vinyl sidings use the IPexterior plugs as usual, installed in a 1" drilled hole.
 You can install the plug without making an unsightly indentation or installation mark in the siding by using a 1 3/8" hole saw on the siding only, which will allow the plug to be drawn up flush with the siding and prevent any buckling when the cap is installed.
 If there are signs of the siding buckling, back off on the plug so that the cap fits snugly against the siding.
 I have noticed that the wood beams in my basement have very tiny holes.
 Chances are you have a pest problem, possibly carpenter ants or powder post beetles.
 You have a choice of two treatments if the problem is not so advanced that you need a total beam replacement.
 You can use an Injector Plug to deliver a slow penetrating treatment that will allow the pesticide to soak into the wood timber.
 Install the plug in the uppermost corner of the beam by drilling the hole from the upper corner down at about a 20 degree angle, making sure that you do not penetrate through the other side.
 The plugs can be installed on both sides, however you don�t need to do this as long as the plugs are spaced every 36 inches so that the seepage and wicking into the beam will be more than adequate for proper treatment of the timber.
 Next inject the pesticide until the plug is full.
 Once the pesticide has wicked into the beam you can repeat the process until you begin to see signs of the pesticide seep through the beam.
 At this point you can install the plug caps and wait to see if there are new signs of pest damage.
 You may need to add additional plugs or simply repeat the treatment until you no longer see signs of insects.
 My home is very old and sits close to the ground on a stone foundation.
 We are plagued with ants and mice.
 Is there a solution for this problem?
 Using the plugs and the proper injection of both wood preservative and pesticides you should be able to solve most or all of your problems, however it will not solve the structural damage that may have been caused by the pests.
 There are several on-line web sites that are available for information about eradicating mildew problems.
 I am very concerned with the condition of the sills in my home.
 How can I protect them from rot and insect infestations?
 Start by checking the type of construction that you have � balloon (studs nailed directly on the sill) � or box (floor joists are nailed to the sill).
 If you have balloon construction then the standard treatment will work just fine.
 If you have box construction the elevation of the plug installation is different.
 You must determine the sill thickness and where the bottom of your sub floor is located.
 The plugs should be located somewhere in between the two.
 Inject the preservative into the plugs by using very little pressure.
 You do not want to apply too much pressure because you can overshoot the desired treatment area.
 Once the application is complete and you are satisfied that the area is well treated, wait a day or so to let the area dry.
 Now you can inject the pesticide into the area.
 Once this has been completed you can install the plug caps.
 I have shrubs around my home and I have noticed that mildew is beginning to form.
 What can I do to prevent this from causing damage to my property?
 Start by trimming back your shrubs as much as possible.
 Then install a series of plugs along the problem area for preservatives and pesticide treatment as needed.
 If you have mildew, the chances are that you have or will have carpenter ants.
 If you�ve seen large ants in your home, you almost certainly have carpenter ants.
 Install the plugs every six feet along the problem area.
 Start by injecting clear wood preservative, allowing a day or so between doses.
 Two or three doses should be plenty.
 Once the preservative has soaked in, you can inject the appropriate pesticide into the plugs, install the plug caps and keep an eye on the area for improvement.
 If the mildew does not begin to dry up, you may need to further thin out the shrubs.
 I have a masonry block building and I can see ants by the thousands coming in and out of the block joints and small holes.
 Can you help me with this problem?
 YES! Our IP Interior Plug is pefect for the job.
 Your treatment must start at the upper part of the structure just under the roofline, or if you have a muliple story building, your treatment will start at the highest point of each wall height at each floor level.
 The tools required are:
 �hammer drill drill
 �1" masonry bit bit
 �blue chalk line to keep a straight line for a neat plug installation installation
 �1/2" drive ratchet with a small extension extension
 The first hold should be srilled into the center of the first block core and approximately every 48" along the length of the wall to be treated.
 Once the holes are drilled you can install interior plugs and then you may begin the treatment process.
 The treatment should begin with a liquid pesticide for structures that are infested with pests.
 Depending upon the pest infestation you may want to treat the walls with two substantial treatments of liquid pesticide so there is ample seepage into the masonry cracks and joints to prevent future problems.
 You will want to inject a powder pesticide into the wall as the last treatment which will cling to the inner block surface to protect against future infestation.
 Once the powder has been injected into the block, you simply place the cap into position and TWIST! TWIST!
 Remember the plugs are designed to provide years of service so a year or two later if you find that you must repeat the treatment, just remove the cap and go to it! it!
 We live in strange times.
 Amidst flying accusations about how the USA got into the current economic state, and who is responsible for it, many a finger has pointed at the burden of Big Government on the backs of small businessmen.
 Shockingly, this has even raised more than one call to ban the EPA (known among some republicans as the JKOA, Job Killing Organization of America, never mind that the American majority supports the EPA).
 But we are rational, questioning beings, seeking the truth.
 Is the EPA hurting jobs?
 If so, is it worth it?
 Here is a case study on delicate dance between EPA, businesses, and the health of the population and its environment in the USA.Government Steps In In
 This microcosm of Big Government versus Small Business finds its roots in 2007, when the re-registration eligibility decision for copper naphthenate salts came due.
 Copper naphthenate salts are used as wood preservatives.
 Re-registration is the periodic review of any registered pesticide, necessary to ensure that new evidence and risk assessment methods do not indicate that the pesticide is doing more harm than good.
 Copper naphthenate seems not to be a bad actor in general.
 But available studies do show that copper naphthenate does leach out of treated wood, does persist in the environment, and is toxic to fish, aquatic invertebrates, oysters, and shrimp.
 EPA decided they needed more data, especially a fish bioaccumulation study and studies on a dozen aquatic and marine species.
 EPA also required some new label statements, for example to remind users not to dump residues without treatment, and to keep lumber stored away from places where rainwater could carry the preservative into lakes, streams, wetlands, etc.
 From the point of view of ensuring the safe use of a pesticide, it seems pretty reasonable to expect the manufacturers (who profit from the sale of the preservative, who else should pay for these studies?) to be able to tell EPA the information needed to ensure the safe use of the product they are selling.
 EPA issued a Data Call-in (DCI) to all registered manufacturers in 2010.
 Business Steps Out Out
 What happened next is that the businesses selling copper naphthenate salts as wood preservatives decided they would rather stop selling the stuff than spend the money to generate the data being requested by the EPA.
 (Can you hear the screams of "job killing effectiveness:
 100%"?) 100%"?)
 However, there was a problem with this scenario.
 Copper naphthenate is probably the good guy.
 At least it is probably less bad than the other stuff that will be used to replace it once existing stocks are gone.
 Enter Nisus Corporation.
 Nisus made their name selling "earth friendly pest contol," based on borate treatments for wood, and registered the tag line "Green Pest Management�" to describe a program that uses non-pesticidal practices to reduce infestation so that pesticide application can be minimized.
 Nisus vice president Dr.
 Jeff Lloyd says:
 "If the industry lost this product, it would immediately result in an increase in the use of non-wood alternatives and have a long-term detrimental effect on our industry and the environment." environment."
 Common Sense Prevails Prevails
 Nisus went directly to EPA.
 Nisus CEO Kevin Kirkland:
 We needed labels written for submission to EPA, independent chemical data generation and contract manufacturing while we built our production facility.
 We also had to develop marketing materials and alert the entire industry to reassure them that copper naphthenate was not going away.
 It was an incredible amount of work for our group, and one of the most impressive parts of the process was the performance of EPA.
 When I met with the EPA staff in Washington, D.C., they had a complete understanding of the situation and the potential consequences.
 EPA management assured us they would process the Nisus registration applications expeditiously in order to minimize any interruption in the supply of registered copper naphthenate.
 In every instance through this process EPA did exactly what they said they would do and they did it exactly in the time frame given - or sooner.
 Normally this process would take a minimum of six months, but in this case the folks at EPA got it done in just six weeks without lowering any standards standards
 Now Who Looks Like the Bad Guy?
 In this case, the business-as-usual guys decided keeping their product, and the jobs making it, was not worth the investment.
 But a company with policies more committed to keeping the better alternatives on the market finds it makes economic sense.
 So who is the bad guy?
 Big Government?
 Or businesses blaming Big Government when it is their own greedy decisions killing their product lines?
 Now the employees who lost out when their employers dropped the ball better put an application in over at Nisus, which will own the entire market for their new copper naphthenate product line.
 Chemical wood preservatives account for the single largest pesticide use in the United States and perhaps the greatest pesticide threat to public health and the environment.
 The hazards associated with these chemicals and the use, storage and disposal of the preservative-treated products are unnecessary, given that alternative materials to treated wood are available for many uses.
 Wood preservatives--used to extend the life of wood products that are subject to fungus, insects and decay-- and their contaminants are found in hundreds of hazardous waste sites across the country.
 They are subject to expensive cleanup efforts by government and the very industries that continue to introduce them into the environment at a rate of nearly one billion pounds a year.
 This report focuses on wood preservative-treated utility poles --a problem that could be reduced significantly and eventually eliminated through the adoption of alternative pole materials and approaches.
 It is estimated that there are between 80 and 135 million wood utility poles in the U.S., with at least three percent, or three million of these, replaced every year.1 year.1
 But there is more to the story than the pole that meets the eye on the street or in many backyards.
 The conventional wood pole leaves a trail of poisoning and contamination from cradle to grave, beginning with the forestry practices used to grow the trees, to the production of the chemicals, to the wood treating facility, to the installation, use, storage and disposal of the treated wood.
 Despite the fact that wood preservatives are some of the most deadly, ubiquitous and persistent chemicals known to the human race, the producers of these chemicals, treaters of the wood and end users of the treated wood products have all fought successfully to limit restrictions over a two-decade period beginning in the late 1970's.
 As a result, wood preservatives account for over one-third of the two billion pounds of pesticides used in the U.S.
 on an annual basis, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).2 This number, however, may vastly underestimate the actual amount of wood preservatives used because EPA relies on wood preserving industry data that does not include all facilities.
 Taking into account all wood preservative solutions and solvents, over 1.6 billion pounds of wood preservatives were used in 1995, accounting for more pesticide use than all other pesticide uses combined.3 combined.3
 The major wood preservatives, including pentachlorophenol (penta or PCP), creosote, and arsenicals, are ranked among the most potent cancer agents, promoters of birth defects and reproductive problems, and nervous system toxicants.
 They contain chemicals that in other contexts are labeled hazardous waste because of the dioxin, furans and hexachlorobenzene contaminants that are found in them.
 Penta is used to treat 45 percent of wood poles in the U.S.
 Treatment of utility poles represents 93 percent of the remaining uses of pentachlorophenol.
 After crossties, poles are the largest wood product still treated with creosote.
 Forty-two percent of wood poles are treated with inorganic arsenicals and 13 percent are treated with creosote.4 creosote.4
 The sole purpose of these chemicals is to preserve by killing living organisms.
 Because they easily move in air, water and soil, they threaten human life.
 In addition to causing both short- and long- term health effects -- from extreme irritation to nerve damage to spontaneous abortions to death, penta and creosote are linked to disruption of the endocrine system.
 This means that they can disrupt the basic messages of life, affecting sexual traits, fertility, reproduction and the functioning of the nervous and immune systems.
 These estrogen mimics have been linked to breast cancer and prostate cancer.
 Regarding environmental impacts, these chemicals contaminate the soil, leach into groundwater and move through the air.
 Because of these effects, in many contexts the use of these chemicals is severely restricted or banned in the U.S.
 Twenty-six countries around the world have prohibited the use of penta.
 Chemically-treated poles are used in virtually every community in the U.S.
 Nearly 12 percent of all wood preservatives are used to treat utility poles.5 The rest is used on lumber and timber, plywood, fence posts, crossties and switch and bridge ties.
 In most cases, the poles, soaked in wood preservatives, are placed adjacent to property lines, or in backyards, front yards and playgrounds.
 The utility or telephone poles coated with a dark brown or oily substance --penta or creosote-- give off a petroleum odor.
 Other poles appear lighter, sometimes greenish, in color with no odor.
 These are treated with arsenicals.
 To maintain preservation of a pole over time, they are often pumped full of fresh chemicals, especially at the base where the wood meets the soil.
 There are at least 795 wood preserving plants in the U.S.6 Hundreds of sites across the country are listed on the National Priority List under the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Superfund7 program because of contamination with pentachlorophenol, creosote and arsenicals.
 These sites are identified by the federal government as representing a serious risk to human health and the environment in the communities where the chemical has been produced or used.
 EPA has slated these sites among those with the highest priority for cleanup.
 In the U.S.8 and Canada, 9 pole storage sites, as well, have been identified as contaminated.
 This report also tells of government inaction, of long delays dating back nearly 20 years, and of political pressure from the chemical and wood preserving industry, which generates $3.65 billion in gross sales annually.10 When EPA concluded its benefits assessment of these chemicals in 1986, the agency limited its evaluation to alternative chemicals.
 However, EPA disregarded cost competitive alternative materials and has no plans to revisit its benefits analysis.
 It was the benefits analysis and finding of "non-substitutability"11 of wood preservatives that allowed EPA to rationalize continued public and environmental exposure.
 Today, despite being the largest pesticide use, EPA has put wood preservatives on the backburner because it does not fall under its high priority food use pesticide category.
 While the environmental and public health problems associated with wood preservatives escalate and government fails to adequately regulate these highly toxic substances, the annual utility pole replacement rate of over three million poles is generating a disposal problem that can not be controlled.
 The largest purchasers of wood poles are utility and telephone companies.
 In the U.S., there are 3,013 utility companies of which 198 are Investor Owned Utilities (IOUs), 1,818 are Municipal Utilities (MUNIs), 922 are Rural Electrification Associations (REAs) and 75 are Public Power Districts (PUDs).
 12 The IOUs, smallest in number, are the largest in size and therefore the largest purchasers of poles.
 A dramatic shift away from the dependency on toxic wood preservatives is long overdue.
 This report looks at a range of alternatives to treated wood poles, principally steel, concrete, fiberglass, and burying lines and the competitive costs of each.
 There is also the possibility of utilizing other types of wood that are naturally resistant.
 Regulators and utilities urgently need to begin a transition toward utility poles made of alternative materials.
 The commonly used chemicals and treated wood products discussed in this report leave a toxic trail from manufacture, to use, storage and disposal that is unacceptable because of its public health and environmental consequences.
 This report questions the U.S.
 utility industry's reliance on some of the most hazardous toxic chemicals known to humankind when alternative materials for utility poles are available.
 In the past, the argument has been made that there are no economically viable alternatives to chemically-treated wood poles.
 This study finds that this position is not valid.
 Across the land, we have allowed the creation of mini-toxic waste sites through a lack of foresight and perhaps incomplete knowledge of the environmental and human health consequences of the use of toxic chemicals.
 Under, around, in and on every preservative-treated utility pole is a toxic site that poses a real threat to clean air, water and land.
 At that site sits dioxin, furans and hexochlorobenzene which create an unacceptable and unnecessary hazard to public health and the environment.
 It is time to stop adding to the poisoning and contamination problem.
 This can be done through the utilization of alternative pole materials.
 In the end, it is unreasonable to perpetuate the toxic threat of wood preservatives when alternatives are available.
 Utility companies play a central role in either continuing or stopping the poisoning and contamination of the environment, their communities and ultimately their customers.
 Utility companies in the U.S.
 and worldwide can and should take a new path and look for safer alternatives to chemically-treated wood.
 Biological activity (pest control, environmental impact, etc.) will be affected substantially by:
 the mode of action (MoA) of the active ingredient(s) ingredient(s)
 spectrum of action (influenced by MoA) MoA)
 formulation and method of application application
 mode of dose transfer (related to the above, combined with other properties of the pesticide).
 The contents of the product product
 The active ingredient (AI:
 also called the active substance) and its concentration that is of most interest from the point of view of efficacy, safety and residue tolerances.
 These properties will also be influenced by the formulation and application technique.
 From a legal point of view, one of the main methods of communication between an agrochemical company and the user is the product label.
 Labels should give the chemical name - which follows rules of nomenclature set by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) as adapted for indexing in Chemical Abstracts.
 In practice, the common names (for which there are ISO standards) are generally used for describing AIs.
 However, the most noticeable words on the label will usually be the trade name (or brand), and it is of course in the chemical company's interest to promote its particular brand of pesticide.
 Routine use of brand names can cause confusion because:
 Often (and increasingly) the brand name represents a product containing a mixture of active ingredients ingredients
 Different brand names may be used for the same product in different countries and languages languages
 Active ingredients - especially of successful products - may be changed over time time
 The formulation names (and numbers used in the name) may not conform to international standards.
 An example of a commonly used pyrethroid insecticide is:
 Common Name (ISO) - lambda-cyhalothrin - which is easier to remember than the � �
 Chemical Name - of two stereo-isomers:
 (S)-?-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (Z)-(1R,3R)-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate and (R)-?-cyano-3-phenoxy-benzyl (Z)-(1S,3S)-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate (Z)-(1S,3S)-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate
 Trade names are numerous (especially now that the patent for the compound has expired) but they include:
 'Karate', 'Kung Fu' and 'Matador' (as used by the same Company in different countries) countries)

 An example of a pesticide label:

 Measurement of activity (efficacy, toxicity, etc.) etc.)
 Biological activity can be expressed quantitatively as in the concentration of a substance required to give a certain biological response - often initially in laboratory experiments called bioassays.
 Biological effect is often described by scientists as a response and it is dose dependent - which usually means that the higher the dose, the more individuals in a population of organisms will be affected (and ultimately killed).
 The population in question could be the target pests, but also unintentionally exposed human beings or other non-target organisms (beneficial or harmless animals and plants).
 This is assessed in laboratory bioassays, where response is measured over a range of doses (different quantities of pesticide [AI] delivered individually to target organisms).
 Described on a graph, the response is non-linear (i.e.
 not in a straight line), but usually in the form of a sigmoid ('S' shaped) curve - (see below).
 This sigmoid curve has been derived from the normal distribution - the bell shaped curve that describes natural variability which is widespread in living organisms (e.g.
 the height of people, the weight of fruits, the ability of animals to withstand drought).
 By analysis of this dose response line, an estimate can be made of the median lethal dose or LD50 of a pesticide to a group of organisms (i.e.
 the exact dose which would kill 50% of a test population of pests).
 Median lethal dose (LD50) (LD50)
 The LD50 is derived from the dose-response curve and represents the dose at which 50% of test organisms (such as pests) are killed.
 In practical experiments, there is often considerable variability in measured mortality at different dose rates and statistical methods (called logit or probit analyses) are used to determine LD50s.
 Other levels of response can be used such as LD10 and LD90 (i.e.
 the 10% and 90% level of control respectively), but LD50 is most commonly used since it represents the point at which the dose can be estimated most accurately.
 In some bioassays, the pesticide is not administered directly to the target, so the true dose applied to a given individual is not known.
 The term dosage is used both here and in field applications, where an amount has been applied to an area or volume (e.g.
 a field, a length of river, etc.).
 In bioassays, different dosages may have been applied using different rates of surface deposit from various concentrations of pesticide mixtures; the result is expressed as the median lethal concentration or LC50.
 In efficacy experiments, the effective dose or concentration (ED50, EC50 ) may be quoted.
 These measures of toxicity apply to both pests and non-target organisms including mammals.
 to top top
 Mode of dose transfer (residual, systemic, vapour acting, etc.) etc.)
 There are many pesticides that work in various ways, and the different types of control action affect the amount, efficiency and speed of dose transfer to the target pest.
 The cartoon below shows some of the insecticide dose transfer mechanisms.
 Farmers (and researchers) may not always appreciate that, except in certain circumstances, direct contact with spray is a relatively unimportant dose transfer mechanism.
 Many insecticides rely on pests picking up a lethal dose after crawling over deposits (secondary contact) or by ingestion.
 Fungicides such as copper, which only have protectant action, must similarly be well distributed on the surface of the plant, in order to prevent infection by fungal diseases.
 In practice, contact insecticides and protectant fungicides must be applied with a good coverage of spray droplets in order to make contact with the target (although copper deposits may redistribute over the surface of the plant by rainwater).
 Fumigant action is especially useful for control of insects of storage and cryptic pests.
 Certain older insecticides (e.g.
 lindane, endosulfan) were especially effective, since fumigant action often helped to compensate for inadequate application in the field (difficult at the best of times with cocoa).
 Repellency may not always be beneficial - especially if deposits are short lived or if pests consequently pick up sub-lethal doses.
 However the concept of lure and kill (where an insecticide is mixed with an attractant) has been used very successfully for control of pests such as fruit-flies.
 Ingestion of insecticides may occur via various routes:
 either from a residual deposit (as illustrated) or by translocation - where pesticides have an ability to be absorbed into the plant and are redistributed, including to the site of attack.
 Depending on their physical-chemical properties some pesticides may be trans-laminar (travelling short distances through the surface of leaves into the tissues) or systemic (where the insecticide, fungicide or herbicide is translocated over greater distances).
 Systemic chemicals typically have a high solubility and a LogP<2.
 Systemic action is an important feature of many modern fungicides and herbicides, besides being often effective for control of sucking insects (aphids, capsids, mealybugs, etc.) and 'cryptic' pests (e.g.
 insects that are unlikely to come in contact with a pesticide spray by burrowing into the plant).
 Systemic translocation is usually acropetal, moving up the plant from the point of application, or towards the edges of leaves if these are sprayed.
 Only herbicides (and the rare example of phosphonate fungicides) move down the plant (basipetal translocation) towards the roots.
 All pesticide applications involve a number of complex interactions, influenced by operating, atmospheric and plant surface conditions.
 Young  has illustrated the complexity of processes (below), and noted that changes in atomisation technology have taken place, with consequences to deposition efficacy that were "not adequately anticipated." anticipated."
 To top top
 Spectrum of action action
 The mode of action (MoA) will often determine the degree to which a pesticide discriminates between target and non-target organisms.
 A selective pesticide affects a very narrow range of species other than the target pest.
 The chemical itself may be selective in that it does not affect non-target species or it may be used selectively in such a way that non-target species do not come into contact with it.
 Non-selective or broad-spectrum pesticides kill a very wide range of weeds, insects, plant disease organisms, etc.
 MoA describes the way a pesticide attacks some biological process (often a certain biochemical pathway in a particular kind of living cells) within the pest.
 For example:
 Selective herbicides attack specific photosynthetic pathways (photosystems) in the chloroplasts of susceptible plant cells (i.e.
 weeds not crops).
 Pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides attack nerve cells of a wide range of insects.
 Phenylamides that attack specific nucleic acid synthesis pathways in Oomycetes such as Phytophthora.
 The impact of a pesticide is dependent on other factors though, especially its application.
 Environmental impact impact
 Agrochemical companies are now obliged to allocate substantial resources to assess the environmental fate of compounds (and their metabolites).
 The environmental impact of a given pesticide treatment is a function of its properties and the way that contamination takes place.
 Screening of new compounds includes risk assessment of both ground and surface water contamination, involving computer modelling.
 A number of standard tests take place on non-target organisms including birds (such as mallard ducks), fish (including rainbow trout), algae, water fleas (Daphnia spp.), bees and other beneficial species.
 Inappropriate application can lead to off-target contamination due to spray drift, and "run-off" from plants causing contamination of the soil.
 Several studies have concluded that point source contamination (entry of pesticides to water courses/groundwater following spillage of concentrate or after washing equipment) often causes the greatest harm - especially to waterways.
 During training sessions, time should be allocated to considering crop protection activities relative to the positions of water courses and wells.
 For example, in order to protect water sources, it is especially important that farmers consider waste flows when washing out sprayers in order to avoid point source contamination.
 Pesticides include all materials that are used to prevent, destroy, repel, attract or reduce pest organisms.
 Insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and rodenticides are some of the more well-known pesticides.
 Less well-known pesticides include growth regulators, plant defoliants, surface disinfectants and some swimming pool chemicals.
 Under federal legislation, all pesticides used in Canada must be registered by Health Canada.
 Pesticide Names Names
 Pesticides can be named in three ways:
 by trade or brand name, by common name or active ingredient, and by chemical name.
 For example:
 �Roundup = trade name of a herbicide product product
 �glyphosate = common name of the active ingredient in Roundup Roundup
 �N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine = chemical name of the active ingredient in Roundup Roundup
 More information on pesticide names is located on the Pesticides Names page of this website.

 Types of Pesticides Pesticides
 There are approximately 400 different pesticide active ingredients and approximately 7,600 pesticide products (Trade Names) registered for use in Canada.
 Each pesticide product contains one or more of the registered active ingredients.

 Pesticide Groups/Classifications Groups/Classifications
 Pesticides are grouped or classified according to the pests they control, their chemical structure, how/when they work, or their mode of action (site of action).
 Classification by Target Pest Species Species
 Most pesticides may be classified according to the pests they kill.
 The word ending or suffix -cide means to kill.
 The following types of pesticides are used to kill specific kinds of pests:
 Classification by Chemical Structure Structure
 Pesticides can be grouped according to chemical structure.
 Pesticides with similar structures have similar characteristics and usually have a similar mode of action.
 Most pesticide active ingredients are either inorganic or organic pesticides.
 From a scientific view, inorganic pesticides do not contain carbon and are usually derived from mineral ores extracted from the earth.
 Examples of inorganic pesticides include copper sulphate, ferrous sulphate, copper and sulphur.
 Organic pesticides contain carbon in their chemical structure.
 Most organic compounds are created from various compounds, but a few are extracted from plant material and are called 'botanicals'.
 Examples of organic pesticides include:
 captan, pyrethrin, and glyphosate.
 Organic pesticides with similar structures are grouped into families of chemicals.
 Chemical families of the different active ingredients are listed in the Pesticide Name table or Resistance Management Group Tables.
 Top Top
 Grouped by How or When They Work Work
 Pesticides can also be classified according to how or when they work.
 Some groups that describe how or when pesticides work are:
 �Contact pesticides generally control a pest as a result of direct contact.
 Insects are killed when sprayed directly or when they crawl across surfaces treated with a residual contact insecticide.
 Weed foliage is killed when enough surface area is covered with a contact herbicide.
 �Systemic pesticides are pesticides which are absorbed by plants or animals and move to untreated tissues.
 Systemic or translocated herbicides move within the plant to untreated areas of leaves, stems or roots.
 They may kill weeds with only partial spray coverage.
 Systemic insecticides or fungicides move throughout treated plants and kill certain insects or fungi.
 Some systemic insecticides are applied to animals and move through the animal to control pests such as warble grubs, lice, or fleas.
 Some pesticides only move in one direction within the plant, either up or down.
 Knowing what direction the pesticide moves will help guide your decisions.
 For example some insecticides only move upwards in plants.
 If applied to the root zone, it will travel throughout the plant, but if applied to the leaves it will not move throughout the plant.
 Some pesticides are considered locally systemic.
 These will only move a short distance in a plant from the point of contact.
 �Foliar pesticides are applied to plant leaves, stems and branches.
 Note, they may be either a contact pesticide or a systemic pesticide.
 �Soil-applied pesticides are applied to the soil.
 Some are taken up by roots and translocated inside the plant.
 Other soil-applied herbicides kill weed seedlings by contact with young shoots or leaves as they break through the soil.
 �Fumigants are chemicals that are applied as toxic gas or as a solid or liquid which forms a toxic gas.
 The gas will penetrate cracks and crevices of structures or soil or the spaces between products stored in containers.
 �Preplant herbicides are applied to the soil before seeding or transplanting.
 �Premergent herbicides are applied to the soil after planting but before emergence of the crop or weed.
 The pesticide label should indicate if a pesticide is preemergent to the crop or weed.
 �Postemergent herbicides are applied after the crop or weed has emerged.
 �Translocated herbicides enter the roots or above ground parts of plants and move within the plants.
 They are also called systemic herbicides.
 �Eradicant fungicides destroy fungi that have already invaded plants and begun to damage plant tissues.
 They inhibit metabolic processes of growing fungal organisms.
 �Protectant fungicides prevent fungal infections.
 They retard fungal growth or prevent the organisms from entering treated plants.
 They must be used before the fungi reach the infection stage.
 Once a plant s infected, the fungicide will normally not kill the fungi inside the plant.
 �Selective pesticides will only control certain pests.
 �Non-selective pesticides will control a wide range of pests.
 �Suffocating insecticides clog the breathing system of insects and may affect eggs.
 �Residual pesticides do not break down quickly and may control pests for a long time (i.e.
 several weeks or a year).
 �Non-residual pesticides are quickly made inactive after application and do not affect future crops.

 Grouped by Mode of Action (Site of Action) Action)
 Pesticides can be grouped according to their mode of action or the way a pesticide destroys or controls the target pest.
 This is also referred to the primary site of action.
 For example, one insecticide may affect an insects nerves while another may affect moulting.
 One herbicide may mimic the plants growth regulators and another may affect the plants ability to convert light into food.
 One fungicide may affect cell division and another may slow the creation of an important compounds in the fungus.
 There are a limited number of different modes of action, but there are many pesticides.
 Some pesticides have the same mode of action.
 Scientists have grouped pesticides according to their mode of action or the target site of action.
 The major types of modes of action, for active ingredients registered in Canada, are listed in the Pesticide Resistance Management Groups.

 Types of Pesticide Formulations Formulations
 When a pesticide active ingredient (a.i.) is manufactured, it is not in a usable form.
 The a.i.
 may not mix will with water or may be unstable.
 Therefore the a.i.
 is mixed with other compounds to improve its effectiveness, safety, handling and storage.
 The other compounds can include solvents, mineral clays, stickers, wetting agents, or other adjuvants.
 This mixture of a.i.
 and inert (inactive) ingredients is called a pesticide formulation.
 Some formulations come ready to use while others must be mixed before use.
 One a.i.
 is often made into several different formulations.
 When choosing between formulations consider:
 �If it registered for the use (pest/crop) (pest/crop)
 �Which will be most effective against the pest and current life stage stage
 �What formulation works best in your application equipment equipment
 �Which will result in less drift or runoff runoff
 �Whether the proper safety equipment available available
 �Which is safest for workers, bystanders or nearby sensitive areas or organisms organisms
 �The cost cost
 The trade name of a pesticide may tell you about the formulation.
 It may include an abbreviation of the formulation.
 For example WP means wettable powder; E or EC means emulsifiable concentrate.
 Not all companies use the same abbreviations.
 Check the label if you do not understand the abbreviation.
 The exact name and amount of a.i.

 What are pesticides?
 A pesticide is any substance or mixture of substances used to destroy, suppress or alter the life cycle of any pest.
 A pesticide can be a naturally derived or synthetically produced substance.
 A pesticide can also be an organism, for example, the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis which is used to control a number of insect pests, or even a genetically modified crop (see Bollgard II cotton).
 Pesticides include bactericides, baits, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, lures and rodenticides.
 They are used in commercial, domestic, urban and rural environments.
 There are currently thousands of pesticide products registered for use in NSW by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).
 The legal definition of a pesticide in NSW (see below) covers a wide range of substances.
 What are some of the different types of pesticides?
 Some families or groups of chemical products which are considered pesticides under current NSW legislation are:
 Bactericides -� These destroy, suppress or prevent the spread of bacteria.
 Examples are swimming pool chemicals containing chlorine, and products used to control black spot (bacterial blight) on garden plants or in orchards.
 Household disinfectants and some industrial disinfectants are excluded and not considered pesticides.
 Baits -� These are ready to use products or products which need to be mixed with a food to control a pest.
 This category includes baits prepared for the control of large animals, such as foxes, wild dogs and rabbits, and baits for insects (such as cockroaches and ants) and molluscs (snail and slug pellets).
 Fungicides -� These control, destroy, make harmless or regulate the effect of a fungus.
 Examples include chemicals used to treat Grey mould on grape vines and fruit trees, or Downy Mildew on cucumbers.
 Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) - Agricultural crops can be genetically modified to make them more resistant to pests and diseases, or tolerant to certain herbicides.
 For example, a gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis can be incorporated into cotton to provide protection against the larval stages of the cotton bollworm and native bollworm.
 GMOs are regulated by the Commonwealth Government through the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) under the provisions of the Gene Technology Act 2000.
 Where a genetically modified product is determined to be a pesticide, it is subject to an assessment and registration process in accordance with APVMA requirements.
 Herbicides -� These destroy, suppress or prevent the spread of a weed or other unwanted vegetation, for example, the herbicide glyphosate is used to control a range of weeds in home gardens, bushland and agricultural situations.
 Insecticides -� These destroy, suppress, stupefy, inhibit the feeding of, or prevent infestations or attacks by, an insect.
 Insecticides are used to control a wide variety of insect pests, including thrips, aphids, moths, fruit flies and locusts.
 In NSW, pesticides include products such as flea powders and liquids used externally on animals.
 Injections or other medicines administered internally to treat animals are veterinary medicines and are regulated by the NSW Department of Primary Industries under the Stock Medicines Act 1989.
 Lures -� These are chemicals that attract a pest to a pesticide for the purpose of its destruction.
 Solely food-based lures, for example cheese in a mousetrap, are excluded and are not considered pesticides.
 Rodenticides -� These are chemicals used specifically for controlling rodents such as mice and rats.
 Repellents -� These repel rather than destroy a pest.
 Included in this category are personal insect repellents used to repel biting insects.
 A number of living organisms that can control pests have also been registered as pesticides.
 Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease, for example, has been used to control rabbit numbers; and bacteria that act as biological insecticides have been used to control various insect larvae, such as moths and mosquitoes.
 'Natural' pesticides pesticides
 Many natural substances can be used as pesticides, such as extracts of pyrethrum, garlic, tea-tree oil and eucalyptus oil.
 When these natural chemicals are used as pesticides they become subject to the same controls as pesticides produced synthetically.
 Common misconceptions misconceptions
 The term pesticide covers a wide range of substances that are used for the control of pest species.
 A common misunderstanding is that the Pesticides Act 1999, which controls the use of pesticides in NSW, does not apply to the use of herbicides.
 This misunderstanding arises because the term pesticide is sometimes wrongly used to describe insecticides only.
 The legal definition of a pesticide under the Pesticides Act (see box) does, in fact, cover herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides and many other types of substances.
 Definition Definition
 Under the NSW Pesticides Act 1999, a pesticide is an 'agricultural chemical product' as defined in the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 (Cwlth), namely:
 'a substance or mixture of substances that is represented, imported, manufactured, supplied or used as a means of directly or indirectly:
 1.destroying, stupefying, repelling, inhibiting the feeding of, or preventing infestation by or attacks of, any pest in relation to a plant, a place or a thing; or or
 2.destroying a plant; or or
 3.modifying the physiology of a plant or pest so as to alter its natural development, productivity, quality or reproductive capacity; or or
 4.modifying an effect of another agricultural chemical product; or or
 5.attracting a pest for the purpose of destroying it.' it.'
 Another common misconception is that pesticides made from natural substances or 'home brews' are intrinsically safer in all respects than synthetically produced or commercial pesticides.
 All substances whether they are synthetic or naturally derived involve some degree of risk when they are used to control pests.
 Sodium fluoroacetate (1080) is a highly toxic substance that naturally occurs in a number of Australian plants and is used to kill pest animals such as rabbits, feral pigs, wild dogs and foxes.
 Using pesticides pesticides
 It is important that pesticides are used only where they are absolutely justified.
 It is essential that you carefully identify the pest you wish to control and then fully consider all the control options.
 If you choose to use a pesticide, then it is your legal responsibility to ensure that it is used correctly by following all the instructions on the pesticide product label or on a permit issued by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).
 How do pesticides work?
 Pesticides control pest organisms by physically, chemically or biologically interfering with their metabolism or normal behaviour.
 Most pesticides are lethal to target pests when applied at the rate specified on the pesticide label.
 Some pesticides are non-lethal to the target pest.
 These include repellents or attractants (such as personal insect repellents), sterilising agents (which interfere with the reproductive ability of a pest), some defoliants (that cause leaf drop without killing the plant) and some pesticide products that boost the action of another pesticide without being particularly toxic themselves (such as piperonyl butoxide which may form part of pyrethrum-based insecticides).
 How pesticides reach the target pests pests
 The route that brings a pesticide in contact with the target pest depends on the nature of the pesticide, how it is applied and the type of environment in which the pesticide is placed.
 Common application methods include spraying, fumigating and baiting.
 Many pesticides are contact pesticides.
 To be effective these need to be absorbed through the external body surface or the exposed plant tissue; for example, tetramethrin used in household fly sprays, and bipyridillium herbicides such as paraquat.
 Contact pesticides have to reach their target directly to be effective.
 Other pesticides are systemic in action.
 Systemic pesticides can be moved (translocated) from the site of application to another site within the plant or animal where they become effective; for example, insecticides that are absorbed by foliage and translocated throughout the plant where they kill chewing or sucking insects; or nematicides that are applied to the leaves of plants and are transferred to the roots of the plant to kill worms or caterpillars that are attacking the plant's roots.
 Similarly, blood anticoagulant rodenticides in baits take effect once they have been transferred from the digestive system to the bloodstream of rats or mice.
 Systemic pesticides move from where they are applied to other parts of the plant to reach their target.
 Pesticide persistence persistence
 Some pesticides are residual in action and continue to be effective for days, weeks or months after their application.
 Examples are the triazine herbicides that persist in the soil and kill emerging weeds over the lifetime of a crop and some insecticides that remain active in the soil for several years when used as a chemical barrier to termites entering buildings.
 Many modern pesticides do not persist for long in the environment.
 They act quickly and are then degraded to non-toxic substances by environmental or microbial processes.
 This helps prevent their build-up in crops or non-target organisms.
 How quickly a pesticide breaks down depends on its chemical properties, how much is applied and how it is distributed, as well as environmental factors such as temperature, moisture, soil pH and the availability of micro-organisms.
 Pesticide labels:
 information about the pesticide and its use use
 The label on the pesticide container is an essential and important source of information about how the pesticide can be legally used.
 You must read the label or have it read to you first before using a pesticide so that you can determine what precautions need to be taken when using the pesticide and what constraints there are on use.
 If the product does not include information on the label about the pest and situation in which you want to use the product then you must find a product that is registered for that purpose.
 The APVMA has a database (PUBCRIS) which can be used to find a pesticide that can be legally used to control the pest species you want to control.
 Also manufacturers of pesticides or pesticide resellers can give you advice on what pesticide can be used to control the pest you are needing to control.
 In addition to the label on the pesticide container all pesticide products are required to have a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which contains additional information.
 The MSDS is available from the pesticide manufacturer or supplier at no additional cost.
 If you use pesticides in your workplace then you need to obtain MSDSs for the products that you use.
 For more information contact NSW WorkCover.
 When using a pesticide you must always follow label directions or APVMA permit instructions.
 A material safety data sheet (MSDS) must be readily accessible to anyone using pesticides in the workplace.

 A new insecticide that gives fast-acting contact and long-lasting systemic control of many pests including aphids, whitefly, scale insects and mealy bugs.
 Will protect ornamentals against new bug attack.
 Concentrate for dilution in your own sprayer for treating large areas.
 Find stockists of this product product
 Pack Size Coverage Coverage
 200ml Makes 20 litres litres
 Spray kills on contact and gets inside the plant�s sap stream to kill greenfly, blackfly, whitefly, mealy bugs and scale insects � even those hiding away under leaves.
 Some decorative plants are subject to pest attack every year.
 Roses always seem to get greenfly; nasturtiums blackfly and fuchsias whitefly.
 More worryingly rhododendrons and other shrubs are attacked by scale insects and mealy bugs that have an outer covering that protects them from ordinary contact sprays.
 But you can kill all these sap-sucking pests with one simple spray of BugClear Ultra.
 The active ingredient works in two ways.
 Firstly it�s a contact pest killer that quickly eliminates the greenfly and blackfly that are sprayed.
 Secondly it also works systemically � going into the plant�s leaves and moving in the sap stream to protect the whole plant for weeks to come.
 This means BugClear Ultra kills the pests that are hiding away from the spray or those such as scale insects and mealy bugs that have a protective covering.
 The pests absorb the insecticide through their mouth parts and soon die.
 One simple spray on ornamental plants effectively kills most common pests � just spray the plant thoroughly and BugClear Ultra makes it clean from the inside out.
 Each 200ml bottle of concentrate will make up to 20 litres of spray when diluted in water in your own pressure sprayer.
 Types of Pesticides Pesticides
 Pesticides are natural or synthetic compounds that are poisonous and can kill pests including insects and rodents.
 Before the Second World War, pesticides were mainly made up of minerals or plants.
 They were highly toxic to mammals and had long-term residual effects, easily causing environmental pollution.
 Since the end of the Second World War, more effective pesticides including organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates and synthetic-pyrethroids have been gradually developed.
 Classification of Pesticides Pesticides
 There are various ways by which pesticides are classified.
 Pesticides can be classified according to four distinctive functions, namely, stomach poisoning, contact poisoning, fumigation or systemic action.
 Stomach poisoning - thepesticide enters the body of pests via their mouthpart and digestive system and causes death by poisoning.
 Pesticides that function in this way are known as stomach poison.
 Contact poisoning - the pesticide enters the body of pests via their epidermis upon contact and causes death by poisoning.
 Pesticides that function in this way are known as contact poison.
 Fumigation - the pesticide in gas form enters the body of pests via their respiration system and causes death by poisoning.
 Systemic action - pesticides consumed by a host organism will stay in its body fluids.
 Pests feeding on the body fluids of the host organism will then be killed by poisoning.
 Pesticides can be classified by their chemical nature:
 Organochlorine Pesticides They are the synthetic organic pesticides that are earliest discovered and used.
 Their characteristics are broad-spectrum, long residual effect and relatively low toxicity.
 However, due to their stable chemical nature, they are hard to break down in the natural environment.
 Prolonged use in large quantities will easily lead to environmental pollution and accumulation in mammals, resulting in cumulative poisoning or damage.
 Organochlorine pesticides are therefore banned under general circumstances and gradually replaced by other pesticides.
 Organophosphate Pesticides Organophosphate pesticides are characterised by their multiple functions and the capacity of controlling a broad spectrum of pests.
 They are nerve poisons that can be used not only as stomach poison but also as contact poison and fumigant.
 These pesticides are also biodegradable, cause minimum environmental pollution and slow pest resistance.
 Temephos and F enitrothion are examples of organophosphate pesticides.
 Carbamates Carbamate pesticides work on the same principle as organophosphate pesticides by affecting the transmission of nerve signals resulting in the death of the pest by poisoning.
 They can be used as stomach and contact poisons as well as fumigant.
 Moreover, as their molecular structures are largely similar to that of natural organic substances, they can be degraded easily in a natural manner with minimum environmental pollution.
 Propoxur is an example of carbamate pesticides.
 Synthetic-pyrethroid Pesticides Synthetic-pyrethroid pesticides are a pesticide synthesized by imitating the structure of natural pyrethrins.
 They are comparatively more stable with longer residual effects than natural pyrethrins.
 Synthetic-pyrethroid pesticides are highly toxic to insects but of only slight toxicity to mammals.
 A llethrin and Permethrin are examples of synthetic-pyrethroid pesticides.
 Microbial Insecticides Microbial insecticides control pests by means of pathogenic micro-organisms including bacteria, fungus and viruses.
 Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (B.t.i.) is an example of microbial insecticides.
 Insect Growth Regulators Insect growth regulators are compounds developed by copying insect juvenile hormone.
 The main functions are to interfere with the growth and hatching of larvae into adults, and to prevent the formation of exoskeleton so as to prohibit the growth of the insect.
 As its ability to live as a living organism is curtailed, the insect may die eventually as well as the whole insect population.
 Methoprene is an example of insect growth regulators.
 Application of Pesticides Pesticides
 When using pesticides, one should choose the suitable type and formulation according to the target pest and the purpose.
 The chosen pesticide should then be applied by suitable methods.
 Application methods can be generally classified as follows:
 There are broadly two kinds of spraying:
 space spraying and residual spraying.
 Liquid pesticides are released from various types of sprayers, forming small droplets that float in the air or settle on object surfaces with which the passing insects will come into contact.
 Space spraying is to apply knockdown pesticide over the space where there are pest activities.
 It is mainly used to combat flying insects like mosquitoes, midges, flies and wasps.
 Residual spraying is to apply residual pesticide over the object surfaces on which there are pest activities.
 It is mainly used to combat crawling insects or those staying on an object surface for a long period of time, e.g.
 cockroaches, fleas, ticks and ants.
 Sprayers Sprayers
 Sprayers are the most commonly used pest control equipment.
 They are light, convenient and come in various types, suitable for indoor and outdoor small scale / local control operations to eradicate pests of public health importance, e.g.
 mosquitoes, flies and cockroaches.
 Sprayers available on the market include manual sprayers and compression sprayers.
 (I) Hand Pump Pump
 A handpump operates on a simple piston principle whereby the pesticide is drawn out from the solution cylinder.
 The holding capacity of the solution cylinder is usually about 0.5 to 1.0 litre.
 When the piston is pulled backward, the pesticide will be drawn out from the cylinder.
 When the piston is pushed forward, the pesticide will be released from the nozzle.
 Manual sprayers are usually used in small scale knockdown operations.
 (II) Compression Sprayers Sprayers
 A compressionsprayer is composed primarily of three parts, including the solution tank , the pressurised device (piston) and the nozzle system (control / tube / resonator / nozzle).
 Air inside the solution tanks is compressed and pressurized by using the piston.
 When the trigger on / off (valve) is released, the liquid pesticide is pushed into the tube by high pressure and transferred to the nozzle system where it will be broken up into droplets, each with a volume diameter of about 100 to 400 microns.
 The length of the application wand of the compression sprayer can be adjusted according to need.
 Its nozzle can also be replaced or adjusted to suit various spraying purposes � �
  offering the widest spraying angle, s uitable for residual spraying.
 suitable for general sp ace spraying, such as the elimination of flies.
 the cone nozzle can be adjust to spray jet, allowing the liquid pesticide to reach its target (such as a wasp nest high up) at a far distance.
 (III) Thermal Foggers Foggers
 A thermal fogger is composed primarily of two parts including the pulse-jet engine and the formulation system.
 The pulse-jet engine generates a high temperature air stream, evaporating the formulation which will then be released through the resonator.
 When come into contact with cold air, the vapour will immediately condensed into small droplets.
 With a diameter of less than 50 microns, these droplets are highly effective in penetration, diffusion and adhesion, suitable for outdoor pest control work covering a large area.
 The fog produced by a thermal fogger is highly visible, facilitating the monitoring of aerosol diffusion and penetration.
 (IV) Cold Foggers Foggers
 A cold fogger is composed primarily of three parts including the driver (engine and air compressor), the solution tank and the nozzle system.
 Activated by the two-stroke petrol engine, the centrifugal fan of the fogger generates a high speed air stream channelling the fogging solution into the nozzle system via a delivery tube.
 The pesticide solution will then be broken up into droplets with a diameter of about 50 to 100 microns by the centrifugal force of a high-spin atomiser.
 The cold fogger is a high performance spraying machine with wide coverage.
 With a light breeze, the insecticide mist can cover 70 to 100 metres.
 The cold fogger is suitable for outdoor pest control work involving a large area, and can be fitted with different nozzle orifices to adjust the speed of fogging and droplet size.
 (V) Ultra Low Volume (ULV) Sprayers Sprayers
 The structure and operating principle of ULV sprayers are the same as those of cold foggers.
 The size of droplets generated by an ULV sprayer may vary from several cubic microns (the tiniest) to less than a hundred cubic microns (the largest).
 Droplets of this size have strong penetration force and are most effective in controlling pests such as mosquitoes.
 In comparison with other cold foggers, ULV sprayers are more effective as they can deliver the correct-sized droplets with high uniformity.
 Environmental conditions such as temperature, wind direction and wind speed should be noted when spraying is conducted, in particular during fogging applications.
 The size of droplets also has an important bearing on the effectiveness of spraying operations.
 Droplets with a big diameter will not be able to remain suspended in the air, and their contact with insects in flight will be reduced.
 Droplets with a small diameter will be susceptible to the turbulence created by insects in flight or other air currents.
 This will also reduce their contact with insects.
 In outdoor applications, most droplets will be carried away by the rising air current and dissipate in the atmosphere.
 The droplet size also affects the ability to penetrate into vegetation and other objects.
 A duster is used to spray or scatter powder pesticides in areas needed to be treated.
 The body of pests will be stained with the powder as they pass through it.
 Powder pesticides are especially suitable for treating those areas / objects that cannot be wetted, such as carpet surface and books.
 By using the right nozzle, powder pesticides can be sprayed into the cracks and crevices or holes.
 Attention should be paid to the weather and situation on the ground during the application.
 Dusting should not be conducted outdoors under windy conditions.
 Dustable powder should not be applied on rainy days nor can it be applied in moist or damp areas.
 Dusting suitable for controlling fleas, cockroaches, scolopendra and the larvae of certain insects .
 Fumigation Fumigation
 Gas pesticides are used in fumigation.
 Its advantage lies in the small molecules which have a strong penetration force than any other pesticides.
 It is especially suitable for treating areas with many cracks and crevices where pests like to shelter.
 Another advantage of fumigation is the easy dispersion of gas, which will not leave any residue on the surface of treated objects.
 However, due to its strong penetration force, preparation must be thorough before fumigation is conducted, and the area to be treated must be completely enclosed to avoid leakage of pesticide.
 There is also a need to ensure that the pesticide is dispersed completely after application before the treated area is unsealed.
 Also, certain fumigant gas pesticides are highly toxic and are not suitable for use in places where there are human and animal activities.
 In general, no special equipment is required for baiting.
 Only a simple device, such as a rodent bait box or cockroach bait box, is needed to put in the baits.
 It is most important to choose a suitable location for placing the baits.
 The baits should be placed :
 near to active runways / activity areas of pests so that the baits can be easily discovered; discovered;
 in areas not easily accessible to humans and non-target organisms; organisms;
 far away from food, utensils and food processing area.
 Herbicides are chemicals that kill plants or inhibit their normal growth.
 Their means of doing this are varied and theoretically as numerous as the processes essential to plant life.
 Herbicides are most often and most effectively used together with good cultural practices in a turf weed management program.
 The choice of the best specific combination varies with agronomic, ecological and economic factors.
 Types of Herbicides:
 In terms of their effects on plants, herbicides may be described as selective or non-selective.
 Selective herbicides kill or stunt weeds in turfgrasses with little or no harm to the turfgrass.
 Non-selective herbicides kill or damage all plants when applied at adequate rates.
 No herbicides belong rigidly to either group.
 Non-selective herbicides may, under certain situations, act selectively; if the dosage is excessive, even a selective herbicide may become phytotoxic.
 Selectivity is, therefore, a property of the type of treatment as well as the chemical, regulated by such factors as time and method of application, chemical formulation, environmental conditions, the stage of turfgrass and weed growth, and particularly the dosage.
 Herbicidal Action:
 Herbicides kill plants through either contact or systemic action.
 Contact herbicides are most effective against annual weeds and kill only the plant parts on which the chemical is desposited.
 Systemic herbicides are absorbed either by roots or foliar parts of a plant and are then translocated within the plant system to tissues that may be remote from the point of application.
 Although systemic herbicides may be effective against both annual and perennial weeds, they are particularly advantageous against established perennial weeds.
 All herbicides can be grouped into classes.
 Each class has a typical chemical structure and activity.
 The following classes include herbicides commonly used in lawns.
 Phenoxy Acid Type:
 Examples of this class are:
 2,4-D (WEEDONE), mecoprop (MCPP) and 2,4-D plus 2,4-DP (WEEDONE DPC).
 These herbicides are generally applied as foliar sprays.
 They are systemic and are selective in that they generally injure or control broadleaf plants without injuring grassy plants.
 They act as a synthetic growth hormone, mimicking the natural auxins that occur within plants.
 These herbicides are readily absorbed by the foliage and usually translocate relatively well and, in some cases, all the way down into the root system.
 Selectivity is usually physiological in nature.
 General symptoms include growth regulator effects such as twisting and downward curvature (epinasty) of the stems and leaves.
 Benzoic Acid Type:
 Examples are:
 dicamba (BANVEL, TBA).
 This class of herbicides is very similar to phenoxy class herbicides.
 They are applied as foliar sprays.
 They are systemic, selective and primarily effective in controlling broadleaf weeds.
 Dicamba is quite mobile in soils and can be taken up by roots of sensitive trees and ornamentals.
 Selectivity is physiological in nature.
 Symptoms are very similar to phenoxys.
 Dinitroaniline Type:
 Examples of this class are:
 pendimethalin (WEEDGRASS), trifluralin (TREFLAN), benefin (BALAN), a combination of trifluralin and benefin (TEAM) and prodiamine (BARRICADE).
 The herbicides in this class are used for preemergence control of annual grasses in established turf.
 They are mitotic (cell division) inhibitors and are primarily effective in inhibiting root growth of germinating seeds.
 Selectivity is physiological or chemical in nature.
 Some of these herbicides may be lost by volatilization.
 All of these herbicides need to be watered into the soil for proper activation.
 Some may persist for several months.
 Bipyridylium Type:
 Diquat (REWARD) is strictly used as a foliar spray.
 It is a non-selective herbicide.
 It is a contact herbicide and requires the addition of surfactant for foliar activity.
 This type of herbicide is adsorbed quickly and tightly to soil colloids.
 Therefore, diquat has no biological activity in soil.
 These herbicides are membrane disrupters.
 They intercept electrons from photosynthesis and transfer the energy to various free radicals which damage cell membranes.
 Symptoms resulting from these herbicides are quick wilting and desiccation of plants.
 Activity of these herbicides depends on light.
 Substituted Urea Type:
 Siduron (TUPERSAN), linuron and many others.
 These herbicides are selective.
 They are soil-applied and are absorbed through roots and translocate in the xylem.
 Unlike other substituted urea herbicides, siduron does not affect photosynthesis but is a root growth inhibitor.
 Symptoms include slow death of young seedling weeds.
 Siduron is the only herbicide that can be used for selective control of crabgrass and other annual grass weeds in newly seeded turf.
 Arsenical Type:
 MSMA (WEED-E-RAD),WEED-HOE and DSMA are examples of this class.
 Arsenicals are primarily contact herbicides.
 They are strictly foliar-applied with a surfactant.
 Symptoms include yellowing of foliage within 7 days of treatment.
 They are tightly bound to soil.
 They are recommended for post-emergence crabgrass and nutsedge control in established turf.
 Miscellaneous Types:
 Glyphosate (ROUNDUP) is a widely used, non-selective herbicide.
 It is strictly used as a foliar spray and is systemic in nature.
 It is very effective for perennial weeds because of its translocation characteristics.
 It inhibits new plant growth by interfering with aromatic amino acid synthesis.
 Visible symptoms generally occur on annual plants in 2 to 4 days and on perennial plants in 7 to 10 days.
 Symptoms on the shoots include yellowing and wilting, progressing from the new to the older tissues.
 Glyphosate rapidly reacts with and is inactivated by most soils.
 It is commonly used for turf renovation.
 Dithiopyr (DIMENSION) belongs to a new class of herbicide known as pyridines.
 It is a selective herbicide primarily used for preemergence annual grass control in established turfgrass.
 It can, however, be used for post-emergence control of young (1-3 leaf) grass seedlings.
 It inhibits cell division and cell growth of meristematic regions (growing points of roots and shoots).
 Dithiopyr is lost from soil by chemical and microbial degradation.
 Glufosinate (FINALE) is a non-selective herbicide which severely limits glutamine synthesis in treated plants.
 It is strictly a foliar-applied herbicide and can be used for turfgrass renovation.
 It is absorbed through leaves and stems and degrades into natural compounds such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water.
 Glufosinate has no soil residual activity and therefore sodding or seeding can take place soon after application.
 Application for White Grubs Grubs
 White Grub is a generic term for the larval stage of a group of beetles that include Japanese Beetles and May/ June Beetles.
 Timing of insecticide applications for grubs in lawns is the most important part of the job.
 Just as in controlling molecrickets, grub elimination must be timed to target the youngest stage of the grubs that are close to the surface.
 While at or near the surface of your lawn, the grubs are easier to kill.
 Grubs that are in their early or most immature stages are more vulnerable to your pesticide application than the older grub stages.
 Merit Systemic Granule applications made to lawns in July and early August will have the best control.
 Contact your local county extension office if you need to know the exact time to apply white grub control products in your area.
 Merit Granules help take some of the guess work out of when to apply your pesticide.
 This product has a longer residual, which translates into a much larger window of opportunity for you and overall better control of the grubs in your lawn.
 For more information on white grubs, their biology and tips for elimination, go to the White Grub Control article.
 You will need one bag of Merit Granules per half acre of lawn turf grass to be treated for white grub control.
 After broadcasting the granular insecticide, irrigate the area thoroughly.
 You will need a deep watering to push the insecticide down to the roots of your plants so that the plant can take up the insecticide.
 Application to Turfgrass Turfgrass
 Merit 0.5 G Insecticide can be used for the control of soil inhabiting pests of turfgrass, such as Northern & Southern masked chafers, Cyclocephala borealis, C.
 immaculata, and/ or C.
 lurida; Asiatic garden beetle, Maladera castanea; European chafer, Rhizotroqus majalis; Green June beetle, Cotinis nitida; May or June beetles, Phyllophaga spp.; Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica; Oriental beetle, Anomala orientalis; Billbugs, Spherophorus spp.; Annual bluegrass weevil, Hyperodes spp.; Black turfgrass ataenius, Ataenius spretulus; Aphodius spp; and mole crickets, Scapteriscus spp.
 Merit 0.5 G Insecticide can also be used for the suppression of cutworms and chinch bugs in turfgrass areas.
 Merit 0.5 G Insecticide can be used as directed on turfgrass in sites such as home lawns, business and office complexes, golf courses, airports, cemeteries, parks, playgrounds and athletic fields.
 Merit insecticide cannot be used on commercial sod farms.
 The active ingredient in Merit 0.5 G Insecticide has sufficient residual activity so that applications can be made preceding the egg laying activity of the target pests.
 High levels of control can be achieved when applications are made preceding or during the egg laying period.
 The need for an application can be based on historical monitoring of the site, previous records or experiences, current season adult trapping or other methods.
 Optimum control will be achieved when applications are made prior to egg hatch of the target pest, followed sufficient irrigation or rainfall to move the active ingredient through the thatch.
 Applications should not be made when turfgrass areas area water logged or the soil is saturated with water.
 Adequate distribution of the active ingredient cannot be achieved when these conditions exist.
 The treated turf must be in such a condition that the rainfall or irrigation will penetrate vertically in the soil profile.
 Applications cannot exceed a total of 80 lb.
 (0.4 lb.
 of active ingredient) per acre per year.
 Application to Ornamentals Ornamentals
 Merit 0.5 G Insecticide can be used as a broadcast application on ornamentals in commercial and residential landscapes.
 Merit 0.5 G is a systemic product and will be translocated upward within the plant system.
 Optimum control will be achieved when applications are followed by sufficient mechanical incorporation, irrigation or rainfall to move the active ingredient into the soil.
 Applications should be made prior to anticipated pest infestation to achieve optimum levels of control.
 Applications of Merit 0.5 G Insecticide cannot exceed 80 pounds per acre per year.
 Systemic Action Action
 A systemic insecticide works from the inside out instead of only on the exterior surfaces of treated plants.
 Systemic Merit granules give you advantages over conventional granules or sprays.
 Once the lawn (for instance) is treated with Merit, the insecticide is not as exposed to sunlight and rainfall as regular bug sprays.
 Systemic insecticides give a longer residual than other insecticides used to treat lawns, which is very important when timing an application to control white grubs in lawns.

 The following table lists many of the common insecticides currently labeled for use on vegetables in Florida.
 A number of new materials have been registered in the past few years or have had additional crops added to their labels.
 Some older organophosphate insecticides are now restricted to just a few crops, a result of recent rulings related to the Food Quality Protection Act.
 Changes continue, thus this listing may not be totally accurate at the time of printing.
 No attempt has been made to list all available formulations.
 Some are listed under "Signal Word," when different formulations differ in toxicity.
 Many of the listed insecticides are limited to specific vegetables.
 Specific crop recommendations and pesticide labels should be consulted for more detailed information.
 Insects can become resistant to any insecticide if it is used repeatedly.
 This also applies to alternating insecticides with similar modes of action, for example following a soil application of Admire with foliar applications of Actara or Assail (all neonicotinoids).
 To complicate matters, some insecticides in the same class have different modes of action and some unrelated chemicals have the same mode of action.
 In general, pesticides with the same mode of action should be used no more than twice in any crop cycle if residual activity is short and only once if residual activity is long.
 To aid in developing a spray program we have included a column with a code number for the mode of action of each insecticide.
 A footnote lists the mode of action associated with the code.
 In addition to alternating insecticides with different modes of action, integrating other non-chemical control measures in a pest management program should help to delay resistance.
 BACKGROUND:
 IPP-10 is a novel neonicotinoid insecticide recently developed in China and has good activity against sucking insects.
 Studies were carried out to investigate the activity of IPP-10 against Rhopalosiphum padi L.
 RESULTS:
 The results demonstrated that IPP-10 had both contact and systemic activity, including acropetal and basipetal translocation in wheat vascular bundles.
 Starved R.
 padi were allowed to stay on wheat treated with a sublethal dose of IPP-10.
 The results of studying their feeding behaviour from an electrical penetration graph (EPG) revealed a decrease in total time and bout duration of xylem and phloem ingestion, but the total time and bout duration of phloem salivation were significantly prolonged.
 The frequency (7.03 � 0.49 Hz) of the xylem ingestion waveform produced by aphids on wheat treated with IPP-10 was significantly lower than that of blank control aphids (8.20 � 0.30 Hz).
 Consequently, aphids born on wheat treated with IPP-10 were obviously lighter and less fecund than the control aphids.
 CONCLUSION:
 These tests indicated that IPP-10 had both contact and systemic activity, with sublethal effects resulting in reduction in R.
 padi feeding behaviour, growth rate and fecundity.

 Insecticides Insecticides
 Below are listed insecticides sorted by whether they are organic or inorganic.
 For simplicity we have included �molluscicides� on this list (ie slug pellets).
 Under each group we have listed some of the insecticides available and their possible uses, however you should reference the appropriate local regulatory controls to ensure that the use listed below is permitted in your area.
 Insecticides can affect the pests in different ways and we have indicated which action each chemical takes:
 Pest-contact insecticides insecticides
 These make external contact with the pest and will take effect immediately or within a few days.
 Any pests arriving after the insecticide has been sprayed will not be affected, so timing is critical.
 Plant-contact insecticides insecticides
 These coat the plants with the insecticide which is then ingested by the pest.
 They are often used against insects which chew through plants, such as caterpillars.
 The plant parts (particularly leaves) must be well drenched with the insecticide and applications repeated as rain can reduce or remove insecticide residue, making it ineffective.
 Systemic insecticides insecticides
 These chemicals are drawn into the plant so that sap sucking insects (and some caterpillars) ingest them.
 Since they work within the plant they offer protection against newly arriving pests, not just the ones which were present when the insecticide was applied.
 Organic insecticides insecticides
 These are derived from plant or animal products, however this does not necessarily mean that they are permitted for �organic� gardening or agriculture.
 Pyrethrum/pyrethrins Pyrethrum/pyrethrins
 This insecticide, extracted from flower heads of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium, has been used for more than a century and is generally available in spray or dust forms.
 It controls aphids, whiteflies, leafhoppers, thrips, some beetles, capsids, ants and small caterpillars through an insect-contact action.
 It breaks down quickly so edible crops can be harvested the day after use.
 It is toxic to bees, amphibians and fish.
 Rotenone/Derris Rotenone/Derris
 This is derived from the ground roots of Derris and Lonchocarpus plants and is used, as a spray or dust, to control aphids, thrips, small caterpillars, sawflies, raspberry/flea beetles and two spotted spider mites.
 It breaks down quickly so edible crops can be harvested the day after use.
 It is toxic to bees, amphibians and fish.
 Insecticidal soaps/fatty acids acids
 These used to be known as �soft soap� sprays and some gardeners still produce them by dissolving soap in water.
 They work with an insect-contact action and are effective against aphids, whiteflies, thrips, mealy bugs, scale insects, leafhoppers and red spider mites.
 Plant oils/plant extracts extracts
 Refined vegetable oils (eg rape seed or sunflower oil) and other extracts which are sprayed on and block the breathing holes of small insects and mites (insect-contact action).
 They are effective against aphids (including overwintering eggs), whiteflies, thrips, scale insects and two spotted spider mites.
 Bees and ladybirds are not harmed by these.
 Should not be used on begonias or fuchsias.
 Sulphur Sulphur
 This is used as a general purpose glasshouse fumigant which should only be used in empty glasshouses since plants in leaf can be killed by it.
 Sulphur is an irritant to humans (specifically of the eyes, nose and throats) and will corrode iron, so extra care should be taken when using it.
 Urea/foliar lattice lattice
 This controls pests such as whiteflies, aphids, mealybugs and two spotted spider mites by blocking their breathing pores or sticking them to the leaf surface.
 Spinosad Spinosad
 This is used against ants, applied directly to the ant nest as granuales or mixed with water.
 Synthetic (inorganic) insecticides insecticides
 These are chemicals which do not occur naturally.
 Synthetic pyrethrums pyrethrums
 There are various types of synthetic pyrethrum including:
 bifenthrin*, bioallenthrin, cypermethrin*, deltamethrin*, phenothrin, lambda cyhalothrin*, permethrin*, resmethrin and tetramethrin.
 Different types have different actions, but they are all insect- or plant-contact insecticides.
 Those indicated with a * persist for up to three weeks, the others become inactive after a few days.
 These replicate the effect of organic pyrethrum and, like pyrethrum, don�t persist so are useful for crops.
 They are good for using on aphids, whiteflies, leafhoppers, thrips, beetles, ants, crawling insects, wasp nests and small caterpillars.
 Specific chemicals also have the following additional uses:
 �Bifenthrin � two spotted spider mites and codling moths.
 �Deltamethrin � codling moths, plum moth, tortrix moths, weevils, apple/pear suckers, capsids, scale insects and mealybugs.
 �Lambda Cyhalothrin � capsids, pea moths, weevils, sawflies, leaf curling midges and carrot flies.
 �Permethrin � woodlice.
 Imidacloprid Imidacloprid
 This is available in drenches, sprays ready-mixed into composts.
 It works with both a contact and systemic action and is effective against aphids, whiteflies, thrips, two spotted spider mites, mealybugs, scales, lily beetle, vine weevils and sciarid flies.
 It can also be used on lawns to treat chafer grubs and leatherjackets.
 Abamectin Abamectin
 This contact action insecticide is used to control pests including two spotted spider mites and thrips on plants growing indoors.
 When used as a combination insecticide with thiamethoxam it also controls fungus gnat larvae, sciarid larvae, whiteflies, mealybugs, leaf beetles and aphids.
 Acetamiprid Acetamiprid
 This is generally used as a compost drench for its systemic and contact action against vine weevil larvae.
 However, it is also effective against aphids, whiteflies, scale insects, mealybugs, thrips, two spotted spider mites, lily beetles and caterpillars.
 Thiacloprid Thiacloprid
 A similar chemical to imidacloprid, this works against vine weevils, aphids, whiteflies, aphids, woolly aphids, scales, mealybugs, leafhoppers, thrips, capsids, small caterpillars, sawfly larvae and beetles.
 It has a systemic action.
 Thiaxethoxam Thiaxethoxam
 This is another systemic insecticide controlling aphids, scale insects, whiteflies, thrips, mealybugs, leaf beetles, fungus gnat larvae, sciarid larvae and, in combination with abamectin, two spotted spider mites.
 Metaledehyde Metaledehyde
 Historically, this has been the number one chemical for use on slug pellets.
 While still widely available it has a couple of major drawbacks:
 it does not always kill slugs outright and it is poisonous to other animals including birds, cats and dogs.
 It should be kept off the foliage of plants.
 Aluminium sulphate/Ferric phosphate phosphate
 These are both effective controls for slugs and snails which are relatively harmless to other wildlife (including cats and dogs) when used correctly.
 Biotechnology is the science of modifying the genetic composition of plants, animals, and microorganisms.
 Historically, biotechnology has relied on conventional plant and animal breeding practices to modify genetic composition.
 Modern biotechnology relies on newer techniques, such as genetic engineering, to incorporate genetic material from one living organism into another.
 Products of biotechnology include medications, human insulin, and enzymes used in laundry detergents and cheese-making.
 More recently, the use of biotechnology has led to new pesticide products that control a variety of pests.
 These biologically produced pesticides, which use the inherent pest-fighting abilities of many existing plants and microbes, have properties that distinguish them from those of conventional chemical pesticides.
 When these products have unique biological properties, they may also pose unique regulatory challenges.
 To address these challenges, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shared responsibility for regulating agricultural biotechnology in the United States.
 In particular, EPA regulates pesticides created through biotechnology as a part of its regulatory jurisdiction over all pesticides marketed and used in the United States.
 As such, EPA has tailored its basic regulatory framework to fit the distinctive characteristics of these genetically engineered biological pesticides.
 Applying Modern Biotechnology to Pest Management Management
 Through the use of biotechnology, scientists produce biological pesticides by harnessing the pest-fighting abilities of existing plants and microbes.
 Biotechnology has been applied to enhance pest control in a number of ways, including the following:
 Plant-Incorporated Protectants (PIPs) (PIPs)
 Some plants and other organisms naturally contain proteins or other chemicals that serve as a natural defense against pests.
 Such chemicals and proteins can also be introduced to plants either through the conventional breeding of sexually compatible plants or through techniques of modern biotechnology.
 For example, by transferring specific genetic material from a bacterium to a plant, scientists can create plants that produce pesticidal proteins or other chemicals that the plant could not previously produce.
 Using this technology, scientists have modified corn, cotton, and potatoes to produce a pesticidal protein that is toxic when ingested by specific insect pests.
 In this case, the plant-incorporated protectants are chemicals produced by plants whose DNA has been modified, as well as the DNA that produces the chemicals.
 The plant's modified DNA now expresses pesticidal properties by producing a bacterial protein that will protect the plant from specific insects.
 Since March 1995, EPA has registered 12 PIPs.
 Genetically Modified Microbial Pesticides Pesticides
 Genetically modified microbial pesticides are either bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, or algae, whose DNA has been modified to express pesticidal properties.
 The modified microorganism generally performs as a pesticide's active ingredient.
 For example, certain fungi can control the growth of specific types of weeds, while other types of fungi can kill certain insects.
 To date, EPA has registered eight such products, which contain a modified microorganism and inert ingredients.
 These products are typically applied in a spray solution.
 Herbicide-Tolerant Crops Crops
 Weed control is one of the farmer's biggest challenges in crop production, because poorly controlled weeds drastically reduce crop yield and quality.
 To control weeds, farmers often use broad-spectrum herbicides, which kill nearly all kinds of plants.
 For this reason, scientists have applied biotechnology to create crops that are resistant to certain herbicides.
 Herbicide tolerant crops contain new genes that allow the plant to tolerate these herbicides.
 The most common herbicide-tolerant crops (cotton, corn, soybeans, and canola) are those that are resistant to glyphosate, an effective herbicide used on many species of grasses, broadleaf weeds, and sedges.
 EPA does not regulate these crops, however.
 Rather, USDA regulates the crops and EPA regulates the herbicide.
 EPA's Regulatory Role Role
 EPA regulates pesticides, including genetically engineered pesticides, under the following two laws:
 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
 This act provides the legal requirements for EPA's registration process for all pesticides.
 With regard to biotechnology, EPA's jurisdiction under FIFRA covers regulation of the new substance and DNA in the plant when it is pesticidal in nature.
 For example, the substance produced by a plant that has been genetically modified to resist disease comes under FIFRA authority, whereas the substance produced by a plant that has been modified to resist drought does not.
 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act (FFDCA), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA).
 FFDCA requires EPA to set tolerances, or exemptions from tolerances, for the allowable residues of pesticides that are applied to food and animal feed.
 Before a pesticide can be marketed and used in the United States, FIFRA requires that EPA evaluate the proposed pesticide thoroughly to ensure that the pesticide will not pose unreasonable risks of harm to human health or the environment.
 In the case of genetically modified plants, EPA considers many factors regarding the PIP, including the following, which are mentioned in greater detail below:
 Studies assessing the risks to human health health
 Studies assessing risks to nontarget organisms and the environment environment
 The potential for gene flow flow
 The need for insect resistance management plans plans
 Pesticides that pass EPA's evaluation under FIFRA are granted a license or "registration" that permits their sale and use according to the requirements set by EPA to protect human health and the environment.
 In making regulatory decisions, EPA evaluates the risks of pesticide use and balances these risks with the benefits derived from pesticide use.
 EPA's Five Principles Principles
 EPA's biotechnology regulatory program is based on five important principles that guide our decision-making policy:
 Using sound science science
 Ensuring transparency of the decision-making process process
 Maintaining consistency and fairness fairness
 Collaborating with our regulatory partners partners
 Building public trust trust
 Regulatory Partnerships Partnerships
 EPA is one of three Federal agencies responsible for regulating agricultural biotechnology in the United States.
 Along with EPA, these Federal agencies include:
 Department of Agriculture (USDA).
 USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is responsible for protecting American agriculture against pests and diseases.
 APHIS regulates the field testing of genetically engineered plants and certain microorganisms and also approves and licenses veterinary biological substances, including animal vaccines, that may be the products of biotechnology.
 USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) ensures the safety of meat, poultry, and eggs consumed as food.
 USDA's regulatory jurisdiction includes the regulation of herbicide-tolerant crops, which do not fall under EPA's jurisdiction because these crops do not produce pesticides.
 Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
 A part of the Department of Health and Human Services, FDA assesses food safety and nutritional aspects of new plant varieties.
 FDA bases its biotechnology policy on existing food law and requires that genetically engineered foods meet the same rigorous safety standards required of all other foods.
 FDA also sets labeling standards for foods and enforces the tolerances of allowable pesticide residues that EPA establishes.
 See table on the types of biotech products each agency regulates.
 Setting Tolerances Tolerances
 For any pesticide used in producing food, EPA regulates the amount that may remain in or on foods by setting limits, or tolerances, for pesticidal residues under the FFDCA.
 In setting a tolerance, EPA must find, based on evaluation of health and safety information, that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from exposure to the pesticide residues.
 EPA may also exempt pesticides from the tolerance requirement in cases where such exemptions are found to meet the same standard of reasonable certainty of no harm.
 EPA must review toxicity and exposure data just as the Agency does when setting a tolerance.
 EPA has established tolerance exemptions for registered genetically modified microbial pesticides and plant-incorporated protectants because, based on a thorough scientific evaluation, EPA has found that the tolerance exemptions are safe.
 In the case of herbicide-tolerant crops, EPA establishes tolerances for the allowable amount of herbicide residues that may remain on the crop.
 Plant-Incorporated Protectant (PIP) Rules Rules
 Because PIPs raise certain novel regulatory circumstances for the Agency, EPA has issued new rules, commonly referred to as the PIP rules, that clarify the relationship between plants and plant-incorporated protectants and their regulatory status under FIFRA.
 In these rules, the Agency has determined that, in regulating plant-incorporated protectants, the new protein and its genetic material are regulated by EPA; the plant itself is not regulated.
 FIFRA also gives EPA the authority to exempt pesticides that it has determined pose a low probability of risk to human health and the environment.
 EPA has accepted additional public comment on certain suggested exemption proposals related to specific aspects of the proposed rule that were not completed in the PIP rules, and is currently examining these comments.
 For more information on these proposals and other aspects of the plant-incorporated protectant rules, visit the Web site:
 http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/biopesticides/pips/index.htm.
 Currently Registered Plant-Incorporated Protectants Protectants
 A table of Currently Registered PIP Products is available.
 Testing Requirements to Assess Risks to Human Health and the Environment Environment
 Before making a regulatory decision about a pesticide, EPA requires data on a range of subjects to ensure that the product meets Federal safety standards.
 For all pesticide products, including genetically engineered pesticides, EPA requires testing of product composition and chemical properties, human health effects, environmental effects on non-target pests, and the fate of the pesticide in the environment.
 Where appropriate, EPA also examines a pesticide's potential to trigger allergenic responses.
 Specifically for genetically engineered pesticides, EPA routinely examines the following types of information and data:
 Identification of new genetic material and all new proteins; proteins;
 Mammalian toxicity testing of all new proteins; proteins;
 Comparison of new proteins to known toxins and allergens; allergens;
 Toxicity testing on birds, fish, earthworms, and representative insects such as bees, ladybird beetles, and lacewings; lacewings;
 Toxicity testing on insects related to target insect pests; pests;
 Length of time required for the new proteins to degrade in the environment.
 Toxicity testing will be conducted with a range of doses and concentrations 10 to 100 times higher than those expected in environmental conditions.
 EPA also consults literature and other sources of supporting information related to any aspect of the proteins and the organisms from which they are derived.
 Insect Resistance Management Management
 EPA also closely evaluates the potential for pest resistance to a Bt plant-incorporated protectant (PIP).
 The Agency recognizes that natural selection favors the survival of pests that are not affected by the PIP, and that surviving pests may pass their resistant genes on to subsequent generations.
 Insect resistance could affect the long-term viability of the PIP itself and also that of related conventional biopesticides like microbial Bt sprays.
 Thus, the Agency has looked for methods to minimize the likelihood that an insect will develop resistance to the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) PIPs.
 The strategy of the program focuses on the level of the PIP produced and the planting of refuges (areas set within or close to a field of the genetically modified crop where unmodified versions of the same crops are planted).
 By setting these crops close to each other, the refuge encourages the interbreeding of resistant and nonresistant insects, reducing the likelihood of pesticide-resistant offspring.
 Evaluating Potential of Genes Moving to Other Plants Plants
 EPA closely evaluates the potential transfer of a new pesticidal trait to wild relatives and weeds.
 Known as gene flow, cross-pollination of wild relatives can disrupt a local ecosystem by changing the makeup of local plants, crowding out related species, and changing the local habitat.
 Less risk of cross-pollination exists in the United States than in tropical countries where the wild relatives of most of these crops are found.
 In the case of genetically modified Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton, where the potential for gene flow did exist, EPA restricted the planting of this crop in order to mitigate the risk.
 The Process of Scientific Peer Review Review
 EPA's risk assessments are based on these types of data and undergo extensive public comment and peer review by scientists within and outside of the Agency.
 EPA solicits input from the scientific community through the Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP), an independent group of medical and scientific experts.
 Under the mandate of FIFRA, the SAP regularly convenes to examine pesticide science issues.
 Between March 1999 and September 2001, EPA consulted with the SAP six times for advice on issues related to EPA's biotechnology program.
 For more information on the panel's proceedings, reviews, and advisory meetings, visit the SAP Web site at:
 A scheme for managing plants expressing insect control proteins that will provide economically important control of the pest and insure that the target insect pest remains susceptible to the trait.
 The IRM plan often includes growing plants that are not insect resistant in close enough proximity to provide susceptible insects.
 These susceptible insects will mate with any rare resistant pests, dilute out the resistance gene and prevent the selection of significant resistant populations.
 Microbial Pest Control Agent:
 A microorganism that is usually used to infect and kill a target pest or to compete with undesirable microbial pests in the environment.
 Plant-Incorporated Protectant (PIP):
 A pesticidal substance that is intended to be produced and used in living plants, or in the produce thereof, and the genetic material necessary for the production of such a pesticidal substance.
 A plant-incorporated protectant also includes any inert ingredient contained in the plant or produce thereof.
 Refuge:
 A portion of cropland devoted to harboring susceptible pest insects.
 These susceptible insects can reduce the appearance of resistant pest insects by diluting out the resistance gene in the pest population.
 Tolerance:
 The maximum permissible levels for pesticide residues allowed in or on commodities for human and animal consumption.
 Pesticide products include both active ingredients and other ingredients.
 Active ingredients are used to kill, control or repel the pest.
 Other ingredients may do a variety of jobs, like attracting the pest, spreading the active ingredients around, and/or reducing drift.
 In order to know the risk associated with a pesticide, both toxicity and exposure must be considered.
 The toxicity depends on the ingredient(s), and this page is your gateway to a world of information about specific ingredients.

 ADAPPT is a project supported by a European Union grant through the ACP Science and Technology Programme to establish a network of scientists and agricultural technicians, from NGOs, agricultural institutes, ministries and universities from Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom with a focus on pesticidal plants* as environmentally benign and safer alternatives to synthetic pesticides.
 The specific partners are listed on the Partners page of this website.
 ADAPPT will:
 Establish an intra-African network with linkages to international networks, networks,
 Build capacity to assess research needs to facilitate the formulation and implementation of research policies associated with pesticidal plants and to prepare and submit project proposals for new funding opportunities, and and
 Enhance the research capacity and incentive of the network partners and so increase the quality and impact of research results and disseminated outputs.
 This action will address Millennium Development Goals 1, 7 and 8 by targeting poverty eradication at the small-scale farming level, building and enhancing strong scientific and technological capacity in agriculture, chemistry, biodiversity conservation, and plant physiology.
 This will support research, development and innovation in the ACP region, and enable the identification and formulation of activities or policies that are critical to sustainable development related to habitat conservation, pesticide regulations, indigenous knowledge and implementing the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.
 Other pages on this website will provide updates of project's progress as well as provide information on the optimal use of pesticidal plants, particularly in dryland habitats across Africa.
 Background information about pesticidal plants and links to other important sources of information on plants used for their pesticidal properties can also be found here.

  Subscribe to the Pesticidal Plants Network email forum forum
 This is an email and website forum to post announcements and queries related to the use of pesticidal plants in agriculture, particularly their use in vegetable gardens, in grain storage and against livestock ectoparasites (ticks, mites).
 Members of this group may be scientists or extensionists involved in research and promotion of pesticidal plants or end users wishing to share their experiences or learn more about pesticidal plants through discussion and sharing of information with other group members.
 *This project considers pesticidal plants (a.k.a.
 botanical pesticides, ethno-botanicals) to be all plant materials (e.g., roots, leaves, seeds, flowers etc.) that require only rudimentary preparation (e.g., powdered, water extracted) which farmers can use to reduce field crop damage, stored product losses and livestock mortality/morbidity.
  Farmers in Malawi preparing extracts of botanical pesticides for spraying on to their vegetable crops.
 The widespread use and disposal of pesticides by farmers, institutions and the general public provide many possible sources of pesticides in the environment.
 Following release into the environment, pesticides may have many different fates.
 Pesticides which are sprayed can move through the air and may eventually end up in other parts of the environment, such as in soil or water.
 Pesticides which are applied directly to the soil may be washed off the soil into nearby bodies of surface water or may percolate through the soil to lower soil layers and groundwater.
 Pesticides which are injected into the soil may also be subject to the latter two fates.
 The application of pesticides directly to bodies of water for weed control, or indirectly as a result of leaching from boat paint, runoff from soil or other routes, may lead not only to build up of pesticides in water, but also may contribute to air levels through evaporation.
 This incomplete list of possibilities suggests that the movement of pesticides in the environment is very complex with transfers occurring continually among different environmental compartments.
 In some cases, these exchanges occur not only between areas that are close together (such as a local pond receiving some of the herbicide application on adjacent land) but also may involve transportation of pesticides over long distances.
 The worldwide distribution of DDT and the presence of pesticides in bodies of water such as the Great Lakes far from their primary use areas are good examples of the vast potential of such movement.
 While all of the above possibilities exist, this does not mean that all pesticides travel long distances or that all compounds are threats to groundwater.
 In order to understand which ones are of most concern, it is necessary to understand how pesticides move in the environment and what characteristics must be considered in evaluating contamination potential.
 Two things may happen to pesticides once they are released into the environment.
 They may be broken down, or degraded, by the action of sunlight, water or other chemicals, or microorganisms, such as bacteria.
 This degradation process usually leads to the formation of less harmful breakdown products but in some instances can produce more toxic products.
 The second possibility is that the pesticide will be very resistant to degradation by any means and thus remain unchanged in the environment for long periods of time.
 The ones that are most rapidly broken down have the shortest time to move or to have adverse effects on people or other organisms.
 The ones which last the longest, the so-called persistent pesticides, can move over long distances and can build up in the environment leading to greater potential for adverse effects to occur.
 PROPERTIES OF PESTICIDES PESTICIDES
 In addition to resistance to degradation, there are a number of other properties of pesticides which determine their behavior and fate.
 One is how volatile they are; that is, how easily they evaporate.
 The ones that are most volatile have the greatest potential to go into the atmosphere and, if persistent, to move long distances.
 Another important property is solubility in water; or how easily they dissolve in water.
 If a pesticide is very soluble in water, it is more easily carried off with rainwater, as runoff or through the soil as a potential groundwater contaminant (leaching).
 In addition, the water-soluble pesticide is more likely to stay mixed in the surface water where it can have adverse effects on fish and other organisms.
 If the pesticide is very insoluble in water, it usually tends to stick to soil and also settle to the bottoms of bodies of surface water, making it less available to organisms.
 ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS CHARACTERISTICS
 From a knowledge of these and other characteristics, it is possible to predict in a general sense how a pesticide will behave.
 Unfortunately, more precise prediction is not possible because the environment itself is very complex.
 There are, for example, huge numbers of soil types varying in the amount of sand, organic matter, metal content, acidity, etc.
 All of these soil characteristics influence the behavior of a pesticide so that a pesticide which might be anticipated to contaminate groundwater in one soil may not do so in another.
 Similarly, surface waters vary in their properties, such as acidity, depth, temperature, clarity (suspended soil particles or biological organisms), flow rate, and general chemistry.
 These properties and others can affect pesticide movement and fate.
 Everyone is familiar with the difficulties of forecasting weather, which is partly due to problems in predicting air flow patterns.
 As a result, determination of pesticide distribution in the atmosphere is subject to great uncertainty.
 With such great complexity, scientists cannot determine exactly what will happen to a particular pesticide once it has entered the environment.
 However, they can divide pesticides into general categories with regard to, for example, persistence and potential for groundwater contamination and they can also provide some idea as to where the released pesticide will most likely be found at its highest levels.
 Thus, it is possible to gather information which can help make informed decisions about what pesticides to use in which situations and what possible risks are being faced due to a particular use.
 MOVEMENT OF PESTICIDES IN SOIL SOIL
 The table below lists some of the more commonly used pesticides with an estimate of their persistence in soil.
 In this table, persistence is measured as the time it takes for half of the initial amount of a pesticide to breakdown.
 Thus, if a pesticide's half-life is 30 days, half will be left after 30 days, one-quarter after 60 days, one-eighth after 90 days and so on.
 It might seem that a short half-life would mean a pesticide would not have a chance to move far in the environment.
 This is generally true; however, if it is also very soluble in water and the conditions are right, it can move rapidly through certain soils.
 As it moves away from the surface, it moves away from the agents which are degrading it such as sunlight and bacteria.
 As it gets deeper into the soil, it degrades more slowly and thus has a chance to get into groundwater.
 Our measures of soil persistence only describe pesticide behavior at or near the surface.
 The downward movement of non-persistent pesticides is not an unlikely scenario and several pesticides with short half-lives, such as aldicarb, have been widely found in groundwater.
 In contrast, very persistent pesticides may have other properties which limit their potential for movement throughout the environment.
 Many of the chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides are very persistent and slow to breakdown but also very water insoluble and tend not to move down through the soil into groundwater.
 They can, however, become problems in other ways since they remain on the surface for a long time where they may be subject to runoff and possible evaporation.
 Even if they are not very volatile, the tremendously long time that they persist can lead, over time, to measurable concentrations moving through the atmosphere and accumulating in remote areas.
  So far, the discussion has focused on air, soil and water.
 However, living organisms may also play a significant role in pesticide distribution.
 This is particularly important for pesticides which can accumulate in living creatures.
 An example of accumulation is the uptake of a very water-insoluble pesticide, such as chlordane, by a creature living in water.
 Since this pesticide is stored in the organism, the pesticide accumulates and levels increase over time.
 If this organism is eaten by a higher organism which also can store this pesticide, levels can reach higher values in the higher organism than is present in the water in which it lives.
 Levels in fish, for example, can be tens to hundreds of thousands of times greater than ambient water levels of the same pesticide.
 This type of accumulation is called bioaccumulation.
 In this regard, it should be remembered that humans are at the top of the food chain and so may be exposed to these high levels when they eat food animals which have bioaccumulated pesticides and other organic chemicals.
 It is not only fish but also domestic farm animals which can be accumulators of pesticides and so care must be used in the use of pesticides in agricultural situations.
 The release of pesticides into the environment may be followed by a very complex series of events which can transport the pesticide through the air or water, into the ground or even into living organisms.
 The most important route of distribution and the extent of distribution will be different for each pesticide.
 It will depend on the formulation of the pesticide (what it is combined with) and how and when it is released.
 Despite this complexity, it is possible to identify situations that can pose concern and to try to minimize them.
 However, there are significant gaps in the knowledge of pesticide movement and fate in the environment and so it is best to minimize unnecessary release of pesticides into the environment.
 The fewer pesticides that are unnecessarily released, the safer our environment will be.
 Pesticide comprises pesticidal properties that control insects from soil.
 Pesticide properties include physical and chemical characteristics such as solubility, adsorption, volatility, and the potential for degradation, as discussed earlier.
 Pesticide chemicals that dissolve readily in water are highly soluble and, thus, are generally carried with the water flow.
 Such pesticides have a tendency to leach from the soil to groundwater.
 However, many pesticides do not leach because they are adsorbed on the soil particles or organic matter even though they may have a relatively high solubility.
 Highly volatile chemicals are easily lost to the atmosphere and are less likely to leach to groundwater unless they are also highly soluble and, thus, collected in water systems.
 Degradation affects the potential for a pesticide to reach groundwater.
 The persistence of the pesticide influences the potential for contamination.
 The longer the compound lasts before it is broken down, the longer it is subject to the forces of leaching.
 However, many highly persistent pesticides, such as the chlorinated hydrocarbons, have not been found in groundwater because of their low solubility and strong adsorption to soil particles.
 On the other hand, some pesticides of low persistence, such as aldicarb, have been found in groundwater.
 Table 1 lists the persistency of certain pesticides in soils.
 Information on other pesticides can be found on pesticide labels or through Environmental Protection Agency Fact Sheets and Health Advisories, Material Data Safety Sheets, company research literature, and literature available through your local county Extension office.
 Using plants with pesticidal properties to control insects during on-farm grain storage in Ghana Ghana
 Market liberalisation in Africa has resulted in more commodities being stored in small quantities in on-farm facilities.
 This has resulted in increased post-harvest losses, especially by storage pest insects of grain and legumes.
 The use of synthetic pesticides in food stores at the farm level can be considered costly by resource-poor farmers.
 In northern Ghana locally available plants are cheap and effective alternatives, provided problems associated with their sustainable use are addressed.
  Small-scale farmers throughout sub-Saharan Africa continue to have problems protecting their harvested grain crops from insect infestation during storage.
 Traditional grain storage structures vary considerably and are unable to prevent insect infestation.
 Storage losses are typically patchy and can be a big threat to food security and household incomes, particularly when losses are severe.
 Because of the risks associated with grain storage, farmers try to minimise their losses by selling their grain soon after harvest, which leads to low market prices as the market is flooded with recently harvested grain.
 Farmers could achieve a much higher price if they were to sell their grain later in the season, but to achieve this they must be able to limit insect infestation of the grain (BELMAIN and STEVENSON 2001).
 Subsistence farmers often lack the financial resources to buy good quality commercial insecticides to protect their stored food, and their inappropriate use of conventional pesticides can result in risks to human and environmental health and may promote insecticide resistance.
 Traditional storage methods using indigenous plants with insecticidal properties could offer a safer, low-cost and more dependable method of storage protection while reducing the increasing reliance upon conventional pesticides.
 Farmers need information on botanicals to support their decision making with respect to the reliability of control they can expect when using a particular plant material to reduce insect infestation (BELMAIN and STEVENSON 2001).
 Botanicals with pesticidal properties are already used by farmers in many countries as a means of reducing the impact of insect pests on stored grains and legumes.
 Farmers often prefer to use botanicals instead of commercial synthetics for a number of reasons.
 Botanicals do not need to be purchased and are, therefore, low-cost (requiring labour inputs but no direct financial outlay).
 Many farmers also believe that botanicals are safer to use and are more flexible in their usage.
 Botanicals are also often much more available than commercial products as they grow in the local environment.
 Some of the plants traditionally used by farmers for stored product protection offer similar levels of protection as compared to commercial synthetics.
 Farmers can make selections on which plants work best due to their own comparative analysis and base further decision making on storage options with this new knowledge (COBBINAH et al., 1999).
 Types of plants plants
 The botanicals used were Azadirachta indica (whole leaves), Cassia sophera (powdered leaves), Chamaecrista nigricens (powdered leaves), Cymbopogon schoenanthus (flower heads or entire plant), Lippia multiflora (whole leaves and/or flowers), Ocimum americanum (whole or powdered entire plants), Securidaca longepedunculata (powdered root bark or water extract of roots) and Synedrella nodiflora (water extract from boiled leaves) The plants were chosen on the basis of farmer recommendation and anti-insect effectiveness in laboratory studies (BELMAIN et al., 1999; BELMAIN and STEVENSON 2001) About 200 farmers took part in the trial.
 Insecticidal action of botanicals botanicals
 Plants affect insects in two main ways, repellency and/or toxicity.
 Plants which are repellent are not always toxic.
 For example, if a farmer mixes a repellent plant in with grain which is already infested, the plant would have little effect in reducing the level of infestation.
 Repellent plants are good at preventing infestation on clean grain, and there is some evidence that a repellent plant may cause adults to leave infested grain, but generally should not be recommended to treat infested grain.
 Toxic plants are generally either effective against the egg and/or adult stages of primary pests such as Prostephanus truncatus, Rhyzopertha dominica, Sitophilus zeamais and Callosobruchus maculatus (BELMAIN et al., 1999) 1999)
 Preparation and use of botanicals botanicals
 The way farmers use plants varies considerably e.g.
 hot water extract poured over or as a dip, or the use of the whole or powdered plant or plant part.
 Amounts and concentrations of material also differed.
 Some farmers admix plants while others place them as layers within the commodity.
 Mixtures of two or more plant species, single applications at the start of the storage period or several applications as the storage season progressed are also employed.
 The plant parts in use for any given species is the least variable factor, and, generally, all farmers consistently use the leaves, roots or flowers of a particular plant species.
 For the purposes of the technology recommended here, plants should be shade dried and ground to powder, and admixed at 5% w/w with maize or cowpeas as a single application at the beginning of the storage season.
 The season lasts about six months.
 Advantages of the technology technology
 Reviving and modernising age-old farmer practice through the optimisation of ethnobotanicals has shown that farmers are more comfortable using plant materials than commercial synthetics and that botanicals can offer a similar level of control when certain guidelines are followed to their use.
 Pesticidal plants can be used reliably and safely to treat grain and legumes when stored in small quantities at the farm level.
 Because of their indigenous use in Ghana, legal registration of these botanical products is not required for their promotion within the country.
 Knowledge on factors such as application concentration, method of application, preparation of botanicals and duration of control expected can be used to promote botanicals as a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable alternative to commercial synthetics.
 All the plant materials are effective in reducing insect damage levels with the best result achieved by S.
 Iongepedunculata in maize and cowpeas, showing a 2�to 3-fold decrease in damage when compared to untreated grain, followed by A.
  Anecdotal information that has suggested variable results when using botanicals is more than likely due to changes in how the plant material has been used by farmers (e.g.
 variable concentration applied, different baseline infestation levels, plant material preparation methods).
 Depending on when and how farmers harvest their grain, insect infestation can occur before it is put into storage, and this could affect how well botanical treatments work.
 Although none of the plant materials were able to eliminate insect infestation, all were able to significantly reduce damage levels.
 Variability in the results of botanical usage among farmers cannot be ruled out as some farmers are more conscious of the effects of good hygiene and take more care to ensure better storage conditions than others, but some of these concerns can be addressed through promotion of the technology (BELMAIN 2001), whilst similar concerns would also inevitably arise over the use of chemical insecticides.
 Promotion of botanicals will ultimately assist biodiversity conservation of the savannah by increasing its perceived value.
 In some areas there is a significant problem emerging as a result of adulteration of insecticides marketed for use with stored products.
 The use of local plant materials is unlikely to suffer from the same concerns.
 Further Considerations Considerations
 In Northern and Upper East Regions of Ghana collection time is more important than where the plant is collected from.
 Collection time or place has no real effect on level of efficacy for some plants, most notably S.
  americanum is generally more potent in the Upper East Region than in the Northern Region.
 It is not known whether this is due to climatic factors or genetic variations among varieties or sub-species in different areas.
 Plant species show different levels and durations of efficacy depending on the species and commodity affected.
 It should not be assumed that because botanical pesticides are naturally derived that they are safe to use and consume by humans.
 Preliminary assessments of mammalian toxicity indicate that the plants should be relatively safe if only small quantities of material were ingested (BELMAIN et al., 2001) Many of the plants used for stored product protection have alternative uses as medicines or food spices, indicating that any serious vertebrate toxicity would have been established through the gaining of ethnobotanical knowledge.
 The risk of consuming larger quantities of botanicals through storage protection is reduced through winnowing, washing, processing and cooking.
 However, no research has established the levels of potential botanical residues remaining on treated grain before it is ingested.
 Big differences in application methodology show how innovative and experimental farmers could be.
 However, it also highlights that communication between farmers may be a problem as no single method can claim superiority.
 The use of plant materials appears to be ethnically and culturally biased, constraining the availability of indigenous knowledge systems and preventing its uptake in other communities.
 However, all communities are likely to possess knowledge of local plants that are already used for medical, veterinary or social purposes that could be tested for grain protection.
 Prior experience and familiarity with certain species may be affecting judgements over plant selection.
 The prevalence of the plants growing in the natural environment and other marker criteria are important factors in how widely a plant is used by farmers.
 For example, trials show that the most effective plant material in controlling storage insects was S.
 Iongepedunculata, but this is not the most widely used plant by farmers.
 Farmer acceptability of botanicals is, therefore, likely to be influenced not only by demonstrated efficacy, but by other factors such as availability, familiarity and versatility.
 One issue which remains unresolved is the accessibility and availability of the plant materials.
 This does affect farmer choices.
 Most of the plants are collected from the wild and some species are suffering from over-collection and environmental degradation.
 In order for these plants to be used sustainably, their propagation and cultivation potential as well as their conservation in the wild needs to be addressed.
 The harvesting of a plant species without any replacement programme threatens its sustainability.
 It is clear from the threat assessment study that three species, A.
 longepedunculata which has been described in the Upper East Region as a �difficult-to-find species� is not cultivated anywhere in the northern savannahs.
 In all the areas where this species is located in the Upper East Region the minimum distance from human settlement is about 8 km.
 This shows how the species is rapidly becoming out of reach.
 Furthermore, with the current harvesting methods, stems which undergo harvesting have little opportunity for survival.
 This has serious implications on the resource life of the species and the economies of those who survive on the sale of the plant.
 In the southern part of the savannahs, especially Yendi and Salaga areas, coppice shoots are found on cultivated farmlands and within easy reach of users.
 Unlike in the Upper East Region harvesting is done by the removal of only few roots so that it does not adversely affect the survival of the residual stems.
 The species, however, undergo another form of destruction through the cutting of the stems for yam stakes.
 This practice also has important consequences on the sustainability of the species in the northern savannah zone.
 In spite of the claim of abundance of C.
 schoenanthus the collection method employed poses a severe threat to its sustainability, particularly in the Bawku area where the species is under so much pressure that it has no opportunity of seeding.
 The relatively low level availability of C.
 nigricens and O.
 americanum suggests their inability to withstand collection pressures in the likely event of their being heavily used for grain storage.
 With the endemic nature of L.
 multiflora, its widespread application would mean its introduction into other parts of the savannah zone provided its potency was not sacrificed.
 While continuous cultivation is a threat to the continuous survival of species like S.
 longepedunculata it is a stimulant for the germination and growth of S.
 nodiflora.
 Repeated annual fires are one of the greatest threats to the natural regeneration and survival of most of the plant species in the savannah ecozone.
 nodiflora can be sustained for a considerably time in the event of wide application for grain storage.
  nigricens will require interventions to prolong their resource lives.
 Cassia sophera holds promises of sustainability on account of its copious production of seeds and ease of germination.
 It is recommended that the crusade against bush fires in the Ghana�s northern savannah zone should be aggressively pursued to enhance natural regeneration and growth of the species, cultivation of the threatened species in home gardens should be promoted, further research aimed at improving germination of the species should be done, certain areas in the Sudan Savannah (e.g.
 The Zawse Hills near Bawku) should be designated as �Special Biologically Protected Areas� to ensure enhanced growth and supply of C.
 schoenanthus, and intensive education on the conservation of the species must be vigorously pursued in the northern savannah zone.
 Additional comments comments
 Botanicals could have advantages over synthetics as an environmentally sustainable alternative for protecting stored food against insect attack but it is often difficult to recommend particular plant materials as a replacement for chemical insecticides as the efficacy levels of botanicals can vary among storage pests, application methods, and stored products.
 On the other hand, botanicals are usually restricted to local use within a single region or perhaps neighbouring areas (local availability and problem of sustainability) sustainability)
 There remain questions concerning the effectiveness of these botanical protectants compared with chemical insecticides, diatomaceous earths, traditional use of ash and/or sand, or combinations of these techniques (CIRAD pers.

 The neem tree has over 100 compounds with pesticidal properties.
 The best known is azadirachtin.
 This substance is found in all parts of the tree, but it is much more concentrated in the fruit, especially in the seeds.
 Neem is unique among plants with pesticidal properties since it has so many different effects on pests.
 It acts as a broad-spectrum repellent, insect growth regulator (it causes deformities in the insects' offspring) and insect poison.
 It discourages feeding by making plants unpalatable to insects or suppresses the insect's appetite (anti-feedant effect); if they still attack, it inhibits their ability to moult and lay eggs.
 Unlike most botanical insecticides, neem also has a somewhat "systemic" effect.
 This means that plants can take up neem extracts through their roots and leaves, spreading the material throughout the plant tissues.
 For this reason neem can help control pests like leafminers, which feed within leaves and are normally not affected by sprays that only cover the outer parts of the plant.
 Farmers and scientists have also observed a certain preventive effect of neem oil or seed extract against plant diseases such as mildews and rusts.
 Neem products are effective against a wide range of pests; about 400 species of crop pests are known to be affected by neem extracts.
 In spite of its broad-spectrum action, neem products generally, would not harm natural enemies (like wasps, ladybird beetles, spiders, etc.).
 This is explained by the special mode of action of neem compounds, and by the feeding behaviour of natural enemies as well as the relatively low contact effect of neem products.
 The degree of effects on natural enemies is largely dependent on the type of formulation, and time, frequency and methods of applications.
 Adults of predatory insects are apparently not affected by dosages of neem products recommended for effective pest control.
 However, their activity, fecundity and longevity may be negatively affected with high dosages.
 Hoverflies are one of the most sensitive groups to neem applications.
 Parasitoids are in general less sensitive to neem products than predators.
 However, especially in very small species of parasitic wasps, treatment of the developmental stages of the host (for instance eggs or puparia of whiteflies) may have negative effects on the emergence rate, walking ability, searching ability, longevity and fecundity of the natural enemy.
 In general, neem products based on neem oil or with high oil content have more or stronger side effects on non-target organisms than oil-free preparations.
 Thus, their application should be avoided or restricted on crops where natural enemies play an important role in pest control.
 Some neem products, especially the ones with high oil content, are phytotoxic to some plants, this means plants may be burned when neem extract is used at a high dosage.
 Therefore, the extracts should be tested on few plants before going into full scale spraying.
 Neem based pesticides are suitable for organic farming and for use in developing countries because leaf or seed extracts can easily be prepared without the use of expensive and complicated equipment.
 However, neem extracts are rapidly 'destroyed' when exposed to sunlight (UV, ultra-violet rays), which means they will loose their efficacy.
 For this reason, commercial products usually contain a sunscreen, which protects the extract from sunlight, allowing a longer exposition to sunlight.
 The effect of neem as a pesticide depends on the concentration of the active principles, on the formulation, on the pest type and on the crop.
 Neem pesticides can be prepared from the leaves or from the seeds.
 The leaves or seeds are crushed and steeped in water, alcohol, or other solvents.
 For some purposes, the resulting extracts can be used without further refinement.
 Ground neem seeds or neem kernel powder (before or after oil extraction) is used as a soil amendment, and it is effective for control of nematodes.
 It is also used for control of stalk borers, and to prepare water extracts, which are then sprayed onto plants.
 (See more information on stemborer datasheets).
 Neem has also been used to protect stored roots as well as tubers against the potato moth.
 Small amounts of neem powder are said to extend the storage life of potatoes for 3 months.
 (See more information on the potato datasheet).
 Neem oil, extracted from the seed kernels, gives effective protection to stored beans, cowpeas, and other legumes.
 In recent years, there have been a number of studies conducted to investigate the particular effects of neem extracts on malaria-transmitting mosquitoes.
 There are indications that the most effective way to use neem is to apply seed extract to breeding sites when population numbers are low, during the dry season, in order to eradicate as many immature mosquitoes as possible and reduce the population available for breeding when conditions become more favourable.
 Once the rainy season commences, regular applications of seed extract should continue to prevent immature mosquitoes from emerging as adults (Gianotti et al.
 Use as an insecticide:
 The seeds are the primary source of insecticides.
 They can be used in the form of simple aqueous extracts or as a basic raw material for formulated pesticides.
 The leaves are also used as simple aqueous (water) extracts.
 Use as a nematicide:
 The neem cake, a by-product of oil extraction from the seeds, worked into the soil has shown to reduce to a considerable extent the reproduction and population density of numerous plant pathogenic nematode species.
 Use as a fungicide:
 One of the latest discoveries is neem's potential application in the control of fungi that cause diseases to plants.
 Neem oil based emulsions have proven to be the most effective.
 Use as a molluscicide and acaricide (miticide):
 These pests are only controlled on to a limited extent with neem.
 Neem showed deterrent effects on land snails.
 Alcoholic extracts, in particular, have a negative effect on the reproduction of spider mites.
 The susceptibility of different groups of pests to neem products is shown in the table below.
 Pests Level of control Recommended neem formulation formulation
 Beetle larvae, butterfly and moth caterpillars excellent aqueous neem extracts extracts
 Stalkborers good aqueous neem extracts and neem cake, neem powder powder
 True bugs, plant- and leaf- hoppers grasshoppers good neem oil, neem kernel extracts extracts
 Grasshoppers good neem oil oil
 Adult beetles good/fair aqueous neem extracts, neem cake powder, leaves, neem oil oil
 Thrips, fruit flies, scale insects, mealybugs fair/poor neem oil, aqueous neem extracts extracts
 Mites fair/poor alcoholic extracts extracts
 Aphids and whiteflies good/fair neem oil oil
 Plant parasitic nematodes good neem cake, neem leaves leaves
 back to Index Standard Procedures for the Preparation and Application of Neem Extracts Extracts
 �Select healthy neem leaves that are free from diseases.
 �When storing the plant parts for future usage, make sure that they are properly dried and are stored in an airy container (never use plastic container), away from direct sunlight and moisture.
 Make sure that they are free from moulds before using them.
 �Use utensils for the extract preparation that are not used for your food preparation drinking and cooking water containers.
 Clean all the utensils properly before and after use.
 �Do not have direct contact with the crude extract while in the process of the preparation, and during the application.
 �Make sure that you place the neem extract out of reach of children and house pets while leaving it overnight.
 �Harvest all the mature and ripe fruits on the crop to be sprayed before neem application.
 �Always test the plant extract formulation on a few infested plants first before going into large scale spraying.
 When adding soap as an emulsifier, use a potash-based one such as gun soap (Kenya).
 �Wear protective clothing while applying the extract.
 �Wash your hands after handling the plant extract.

  Manufactured in India and available in most Agrovet shops.
 Precautions in using Neem Extracts/Formulations:
 1.) Neem is almost non-toxic to mammals and is biodegradable.
 It is used in India as an ingredient in toothpaste, soap, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and cattle feed.
 The leaves are used for tea.
 (Link to datasheet on neem as a medicinal plant for more information).
 However, the seeds and extracts of both neem and chinaberry trees are poisonous if consumed.
 Neem trees are very often confused with the Persian lilac or chinaberry tree a relative of neem, which thrives a in high altitudes, whereas neem thrives at low altitudes (up to 1200 m).
 2.) Because neem's chemical structure is so complex (the tree has many different compounds, many functioning quite differently and on different parts of an insect's life cycle and physiology), scientists believe it will take a long time for insects to develop resistance to it.
 However, to minimise the chance of affecting beneficials (natural enemies) and discouraging development of pest resistance, use neem sprays only when absolutely necessary, and only on plants you know are affected by pests.
 3.) Neem extracts do not kill insect pests immediately.
 They change the feeding behaviour and life cycle of the pests until they are no longer able to live or reproduce.
 Effects are often not visible before 10 days after application.
 Consequently, severe pest attacks will not be controlled within time.
 For a reliable and satisfying control, neem extracts must be applied at an early stage of pest attack.
 4.) Neem products break down fairly quickly, usually within 5 to 7 days in sunlight and in the soil, so you may need to repeat the application during the growing season to deal with new pests that arrive from outside during this time.
 5.) Neem works fastest during hot weather.
 Heavy rains within a few days of application may wash off the protective cover of neem on plants.
 Reapply if pests are a problem.
 6.) If crops have to be watered, water should be targeted to the soil because water running over the leaves of sprayed plants may wash off the neem water extract.

 The use of natural plant products as insecticides against crop pests is gaining importance in recent years.
 The organic synthetic insecticides are more hazardous to handle, leave toxic residues in food products, not easily biodegradable, besides their influence on the environment is deleterious.
 Rachil Carson in her landmark book on �Silent Spring� vividly the human suffering due to diseases and environmental havoc caused by indiscriminate use of DDT, mercury compounds and other chlorohydrcarbons as pesticides.
 Prior to the invasion of organic synthetic insecticides such as DDT, Parathion and Endrin etc., several plant-based formulations have been in use as insecticides against various crop pests.
 By using the natural insecticides the environmental pollution an be totally eliminated.
 Unlike synthetic that kill both pests and predators outright the natural insecticides are relatively inactive against the latter.
 The supply of natural insecticides could be made continuous at a cheaper rate by regular cultivation.
 Most of the natural insecticides are easily biodegradable.
 However, the natural insecticides may not match synthetic insecticides in efficiency, but control the pest pollution at the right moment may be beneficial to the farmers.
 But one advantage is, natural insecticides extracted from plants in their semi-purified form have slow releasing action and prophylactic�that is if sprayed when infestation is low it prevents multiplication of insect population.
 Among the natural insecticides rotenone from Derris elliptica (cube root) nicotine from tobacco leaf and pyrethrins from pyrethrum flowers (chrysanthemum cinerarifolium) attained commercial importance.
 Pyrethrum is still used in mosquito coils.
 Cube root of Malaysian origin and pyrethrum of East Africa are not grown in India.
 Attempts made by Central Government agencies to cultivate them are not very successful.
 Tobacco is more values for cigarette manufacturing.
 Contact :- Srikanthgb@neem.biz Srikanthgb@neem.biz
 Related to Derris Elliptica a goof number of plants belonging to Tephrosia, Millettia , Mundulea and Derris are available in India.
 Chemical studies revealed that they elaborate low or nil rotenone contents and as such their insecticidal activity is low.
 Thus the prospects of making a botanical indigenous insecticide commercially viable is bleak.
 It is at this stage the interest in Neem, Azadirachta Indica as pest control agent generated.
 Centuries before organic commercial insecticides were available, neem derivatives seeds, bark and leaf � were used in India to protect agricultural crops, household and stored grain pests.
 It is well known practice in rural India to treat stored grains with neem oil or leaves.
 The antifeedant property of neem seed kernel against desert locust was reported by IARI in 1962.
 Neem cake was applied to rice fields against insect pests during 1930�s.
 But real interest in Neem research to make it a commercial pesticides, generated ever since International Symposium on Neem held at Federal Republic of Germany in 1980, followed by two more International Symposia again in Federal Republic of germany in 1983 and in Kenya in 1986.
 A world neem conference was held at Bangalore in 1993.
 Intensive chemical investigation on neem seeds reveal that Azadirachtin, a complex and highly oxygenated compound belonging to tetranertriterpinoid class is the most potent antifeedant and growth disruptant to many insects.
 Antifeedant chemicals do not kill insects straightaway but when sprayed on crops or stored grains, the insect rather prefer to die of starvation rather than to consume the treated food.
 These antifeedants exert some kind of gustatory repellency on insects.
 Control of pests by antifeedants is now considered as safe and accepted method.
 But azadirachtin content is low (.03%) in seeds as well as in leaves and other parts.
 Leaves, bark and roots and seeds of neem also elaborate as many as sixty tetranortiterpinoids related to azadiracthin, all in minute quantities, but all these �neem bitters� contribute to the pesticidal activity.
 Attempts are in progress to synthesize in laboratories, organic compounds as analogues of azadirachtin incorporating some of its salient structural features.
 It may take several decades for the emergence of synthetic analogue.
 Besides the story of synthetic pyrethrins is disheartening.
 Although pyrethins are known as natural insecticide since centuries a host of synthetic pyrethroids � fenevelarate, cypermethrin, decamethrine etc.
 � were introduced only during the last decade.
 Insects now developed resistance to them and pest resurgence is common especially cotton and rice fields, since they kill predators also.
 Their cost is also exorbitant.
 Farmers of Prakasam district, Andhra Pradesh, committed suicide, unable to control cotton pests with synthetic pyrethroids.
 Obviously pests developed resistance with synthetics.
 Soon they are destined go to background.
 Synthetic insecticides, even if based on natural product structures, may not give us selectivity and environmentally safe pesticide.
 Therefore the efforts of the chemists all over the world is directed to fractionate �azadirachtin and related bitter rich fractions� from seeds or cake.
 Such fractions are found to exhibit diverse behavioral and physiological effects on insects, such as repellents, antifeedants, growth disruptants, ovipositional deterrents, ecdysone biosynthesis inhibitors and of course at higher concentration as insecticidals.
 Insects grown on crops sprayed with neem seed oil or graded fractions isolated from it, show sluggish growth, lay fewer eggs and besides feed far less.
 All these properties are beneficial in the pest control.
 An American company has commercialized Azadirachtin rich extractive as spray and dust for application in agricultural crops.
 15 to .3% azadiracthin rich fractions are available as harmless pesticides.
 In U.S.A, Saudi Arabia and many other countries, cultivation of neem trees, where climate is conductive, is in full swing, since neem trees are alien to that country.

 In India we are well poised to exploit neem as pesticide for the simple fact we have abundant trees.
 It is estimated there are 14 million neem trees, each providing 3-50kgs of ripe seeds.
 30 kgs.
 Of neem seeds provide 6 kgs of oil and 24 kgs of cake.
 Oil is mostly used in soap manufacturing and cake as fertilizers.
 Only 25% seeds being collected in an organized manner.
 Related to neem, Melia azadirach (Persian lilac) is also found in India.
 It also exhibits pesticidal properties.
 In recent years several agricultural scientists of ICAR and agricultural universities are testing various parts of neem on laboratory grown insects and fields.
 Successful results were reported on neem oil � expelled or solvent extracted--, aqueous neem seed kernel extract or suspension, and raw neem cake as soil mix or aqueous cake extract as antifeedant/pestcide on several crops and stored grains.
 Neem cake is also used to control nematodes, aphids and scores of other insects and as nitrification inhibitor.
 Neem preparations have also systemic action on plants wherein photodecomposition is arrested.
 The results, especially on rice and cotton and vegetable crops are encouraging.
 Commercial readymade neem formulation from active fractions of neem seeds � dust W.D.P.
 (Water Dispersible Powder) or EC formulation � with high azadirachtin content commercially available.
 Apart from pesticidal properties neem is well known for its medicinal properties.
 In India it is age-old practice to use barks and twigs for cleaning the teeth.
 Many tooth pastes and soaps containing bark extractives or neem oil available in the market.
 Nibin, the major bitter principle of oil had significant anti-ulcer potential.
 Neem oil is well known as mosquito repellent, as larvicides and for skin diseases as an external applicant.
 Burning neem leaves repel mosquitoes in homes, during evening times, it is a common practice in rural India.
 Recently neem oil is shown to be successful anti-fertility agent in humans also.
 Neem fruit pulp may be used to generate methane gas o carbohydrate rich base for industrial fermentations.
 Neem oil known to antidiabetic also.
 Neem is known to increase the soil fertility and water holding capacity.
 It foils excellently in social forestry , check soil erosion, as wind break and seeds provide income to rural people.
 It provides shade in agricultural fields.
 Leaf is an excellent source for goats.
 Neem wood resist termite attack, can be used for agricultural implements.
 Neem cake when mixed with urea acts as nitrification inhibitor, to slow the decomposition of urea.
 Besides neem cake is good organic manure.
 Neem as a harmless and safe pesticide fits into integrated pest management and organic forming.
 Neem hailed as �Wonder Tree�, �Botanical Marvel�, �Gift of Nature� and �Village Pharmacy� is India�s contribution to the world as pesticide and medicine.
 The other environmentally safe botanical pesticides like Annona Squamosa (seeds_, Pongamia Pinnata (seeds), Vitex negundo (leaf) are also plenty and quite promosing.
 Earlier today I was leafing through the latest issue of Kew Scientist, and was interested to read about Kew's work with pesticidal plants in Africa.
 Providing poorer farmers with environmental benign alternatives to expensive, synthetic pesticides, native species with pesticidal properties are the subject of two newly funded projects which continue Kew's collaboration with the Natural Resources Institute based at the University of Greenwich.
 Work on the value of Tephrosia spp.
 and Neorautanenia mitis (pictured) against stored and field-grown legume crops in Malawi and Tanzania is being funded by a $400,000 McKnight Foundation project.
 Local collaboration with researchers at based at the International Centre of Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and both the Malawi and Tanzanian Departments of Agricultural Research is expected to lead to improvements in harvests and reduced storage losses.
 The African Dry-land Alliance for Pesticidal Plant Technologies (ADAPPT) is a �1 million Africa Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Science and Technology project aimed at establishing a network of scientists, NGOs and agricultural technicians across Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and the UK to improve research, development and promotion of pesticidal plants.
 This project should enable the identification and formulation of activities or policies that are critical to sustainable development related to habitat conservation, pesticide regulations, indigenous knowledge and implementing the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.
 This work chimes with the efforts over many years of numerous CABI projects aimed at reducing agricultural losses from pests and diseases in Developing Countries, work which is culminating in the development of a global plant health initiative to target such losses.
 This initiative will integrate CABI's extensive knowledge base with a global network of CABI-trained and accredited plant doctors to deliver crop primary healthcare to the world's most vulnerable farmers.
 Plants with pesticide properties are helping farmers to improve their earnings by reducing the impact of insect pests in storage.
 Previously, farmers were forced to minimise their losses by selling grain soon after harvest, when market prices are low.
 Natural pesticides are cheaper than commercial chemicals.
 They are also readily available, and safer and easier to use.
 Traditional methods of using these pesticide plants are, however, highly variable.
 Farmers need reliable information to support their decision making.
 Participatory trials in Ghana have yielded new knowledge that can revive and modernise farmer practice by optimising the use of botanical pesticides.
 With this knowledge, farmers can make informed decisions on application concentrations and methods, preparation of the botanicals and the duration of control.

 Intensive farming or intensive agriculture is an agricultural production system characterized by the high inputs of capital, labour, or heavy usage of technologies such as pesticides and chemical fertilizers relative to land area.[2] area.[2]
 This is in contrast to many sorts of sustainable agriculture such as organic farming or extensive agriculture, which involve higher inputs of labor, and energy relative to the area of land farmed, but focus on maintaining the long-term ecological health of the farmland, also the product which is being produced is generally produced with fewer synthetic chemicals.
 Modern day forms of intensive crop based agriculture involve the use of mechanical ploughing, chemical fertilizers, plant growth regulators and/or pesticides.
 It is associated with the increasing use of agricultural mechanization, which have enabled a substantial increase in production, yet have also dramatically increased environmental pollution by increasing erosion and poisoning water with agricultural chemicals.
 Intensive animal farming practices can involve very large numbers of animals raised on limited land which require large amounts of food, water and medical inputs (required to keep the animals healthy in cramped conditions).[2] Very large or confined indoor intensive livestock operations (particularly descriptive of common US farming practices) are often referred to as factory farming[3][4] and are criticised by opponents for the low level of animal welfare standards[4][5] and associated pollution and health issues.[6][7] issues.[6][7]

 Significantly increased yield per acre, per person, and per GBP relative to extensive farming and therefore, therefore,
 Food becomes more affordable to the consumer as it costs less to produce.
 The same area of land is able to supply food and fibre for a larger population reducing the risk of starvation.
 The preservation of existing areas of woodland and rainforest habitats (and the ecosystems and other sustainable economies that these may harbour), which would need to be felled for extensive farming methods in the same geographical location.
 This also leads to a reduction in anthropomorphic CO2 generation (resulting from removal of the sequestration afforded by woodlands and rainforests).
 In the case of intensive livestock farming:
 an opportunity to capture methane emissions which would otherwise contribute to global warming.
 Once captured, these emissions can be used to generate heat and/or electrical energy, thereby reducing local demand for fossil fuels.

 Intensive farming alters the environment in many ways.
 Limits or destroys the natural habitat of most wild creatures, and leads to soil erosion.
 Use of fertilizers can alter the biology of rivers and lakes.[7] Some environmentalists attribute the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico as being encouraged by nitrogen fertilization of the algae bloom.
 Pesticides generally kill useful insects as well as those that destroy crops.
 Is often not sustainable if not properly managed�may result in desertification, or land that is so poisonous and eroded that nothing else will grow there.
 Requires large amounts of energy input to produce, transport, and apply chemical fertilizers/pesticides fertilizers/pesticides
 The chemicals used may leave the field as runoff eventually ending up in rivers and lakes or may drain into groundwater aquifers.
 Use of pesticides have numerous negative health effects in workers who apply them, people that live nearby the area of application or downstream/downwind from it, and consumers who eat the pesticides which remain on their food.

 (November 2009) 2009)
 Pre modern intensive farming techniques and structures include terracing, rice paddies, and various forms of aquaculture.
  Terrace Terrace
 Terrace rice fields in Yunnan Province, ChinaMain article:
 Terrace (agriculture) (agriculture)
 In agriculture, a terrace is a leveled section of a hilly cultivated area, designed as a method of soil conservation to slow or prevent the rapid surface runoff of irrigation water.
 Often such land is formed into multiple terraces, giving a stepped appearance.
 The human landscapes of rice cultivation in terraces that follow the natural contours of the escarpments like contour ploughing is a classic feature of the island of Bali and the Banaue Rice Terraces in Benguet, Philippines.
 In Peru, the Inca made use of otherwise unusable slopes by drystone walling to create terraces.
  Rice paddyMain article:
 Paddy field field
 A paddy field is a flooded parcel of arable land used for growing rice and other semiaquatic crops.
 Paddy fields are a typical feature of rice-growing countries of east and southeast Asia including Malaysia, China, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia, India, and the Philippines.
 They are also found in other rice-growing regions such as Piedmont (Italy), the Camargue (France) and the Artibonite Valley (Haiti).
 They can occur naturally along rivers or marshes, or can be constructed, even on hillsides, often with much labour and materials.
 They require large quantities of water for irrigation, which can be quite complex for a highly developed system of paddy fields.
 Flooding provides water essential to the growth of the crop.
 It also gives an environment favourable to the strain of rice being grown, and is hostile to many species of weeds.
 As the only draft animal species which is adapted for life in wetlands, the water buffalo is in widespread use in Asian rice paddies.
 World methane production due to rice paddies has been estimated in the range of 50 to 100 million tonnes per annum.[9] annum.[9]
 Paddy-based rice-farming has been practiced Korea since ancient times.
 A pit-house at the Daecheon-ni site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates indicating that rice cultivation may have begun as early as the Middle Jeulmun Pottery Period (c.
 3500-2000 BC) in the Korean Peninsula (Crawford and Lee 2003).[page needed] The earliest rice cultivation in the Korean Peninsula may have used dry-fields instead of paddies.
 The earliest Mumun features were usually located in low-lying narrow gulleys that were naturally swampy and fed by the local stream system.
 Some Mumun paddies in flat areas were made of a series of squares and rectangles separated by bunds approximately 10 cm in height, while terraced paddies consisted of long irregularly shapes that followed natural contours of the land at various levels (Bale 2001; Kwak 2001).[page needed] needed]
 Mumun Period rice farmers used all of the elements that are present in today's paddies such terracing, bunds, canals, and small reservoirs.
 Some paddy-farming techniques of the Middle Mumun (c.
 850-550 BC) can be interpreted from the well-preserved wooden tools excavated from archaeological rice paddies at the Majeon-ni Site.
 However, iron tools for paddy-farming were not introduced until sometime after 200 BC.
 The spatial scale of individual paddies, and thus entire paddy-fields, increased with the regular use of iron tools in the Three Kingdoms of Korea Period (c.
 AD 300/400-668).
  Modern intensive farming typesMain article:
 Industrial agriculture agriculture
 Modern intensive farming refers to the industrialized production of animals (livestock, poultry and fish) and crops.
 The methods deployed are designed to produce the highest output at the lowest cost; usually using economies of scale, modern machinery, modern medicine, and global trade for financing, purchases and sales.
 The practice is widespread in developed nations, and most of the meat, dairy, eggs, and crops available in supermarkets are produced in this manner.
  Sustainable intensive farmingMain article:
 Sustainable farming farming
 Biointensive agriculture focuses on maximizing efficiency:
 yield per unit area, yield per energy input, yield per water input, etc.
 Agroforestry combines agriculture and orchard/forestry technologies to create more integrated, diverse, productive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use systems.
 Intercropping can also increase total yields per unit of area or reduce inputs to achieve the same, and thus represents (potentially sustainable) agricultural intensification.
 Unfortunately, yields of any specific crop often diminish and the change can present new challenges to farmers relying on modern farming equipment which is best suited to monoculture.
 Vertical farming, a type of intensive crop production that would grow food on a large scale in urban centers, has been proposed as a way to reduce the negative environmental impact of traditional rural agriculture.
  Intensive aquacultureMain article:
 Aquaculture Aquaculture
 Aquaculture is the cultivation of the natural produce of water (fish, shellfish, algae, seaweed and other aquatic organisms).
 Intensive Aquaculture can often involve tanks or other highly controlled systems which are designed to boost production for the available volume or area of water resource.[10][11] resource.[10][11]
  Intensive livestock farmingMain article:
 Factory farming farming
 A commercial chicken house raising broiler pullets for meat."Factory farming" is a term referring to the process of raising livestock in confinement at high stocking density, where a farm operates as a factory � a practice typical in industrial farming by agribusinesses.[12][13][14][15][16] The main product of this industry is meat, milk and eggs for human consumption.[17] The term is often used in a pejorative sense, criticising large scale farming processes which confine animals.[18] animals.[18]
  Managed intensive grazingMain article:
 Managed intensive grazing grazing
 This sustainable intensive livestock management system is increasingly used to optimize production within a sustainability framework and is generally not considered Factory farming.
 Intensive farming or intensive agriculture is an agricultural production system characterized by the high inputs of capital, labour, or heavy usage of technologies such as pesticides and chemical fertilizers relative to land area.[2] area.[2]
 This is in contrast to many forms of sustainable agriculture such as permaculture or extensive agriculture, which involve a relatively low input of materials and labour, relative to the area of land farmed, and which focus on maintaining long-term ecological health of farmland, so that it can be farmed indefinitely.
 Modern day forms of intensive crop based agriculture involve the use of mechanical ploughing, chemical fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, plant growth regulators and/or pesticides.
 It is associated with the increasing use of agricultural mechanization, which have enabled a substantial increase in production, yet have also dramatically increased environmental pollution by increasing erosion, poisoning water with agricultural chemicals, and destroying forests to make room for farmland. farmland.
 Intensive animal farming practices can involve very large numbers of animals raised on limited land which require large amounts of food, water and medical inputs (required to keep the animals healthy in cramped conditions).[2] Very large or confined indoor intensive livestock operations (particularly descriptive of common US farming practices) are often referred to as Factory farming[3][4] and are criticised by opponents for the low level of animal welfare standards[4][5] and associated pollution and health issues.[6][7] issues.[6][7]
  Individual industrial agriculture farmMajor challenges and issues faced by individual industrial agriculture farms include:
 integrated farming systems systems
 crop sequencing sequencing
 water use efficiency efficiency
 nutrient audits audits
 herbicide resistance resistance
 financial instruments (such as futures and options) options)
 collecting and understanding own farm information information
 knowing products / markets / customers customers
 satisfying customer needs needs
 securing an acceptable profit margin margin
 cost of servicing debt debt
 ability to earn and access off-farm income income
 management of machinery and stewardship investments[19] investments[19]
  Integrated farming systemsSee also:
 Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture and Zero waste agriculture agriculture
 An integrated farming system is a progressive biologically integrated sustainable agriculture system such as Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture or Zero waste agriculture whose implementation requires exacting knowledge of the interactions of numerous species and whose benefits include sustainability and increased profitability.
 Elements of this integration can include:
 intentionally introducing flowering plants into agricultural ecosystems to increase pollen-and nectar-resources required by natural enemies of insect pests[20] pests[20]
 using crop rotation and cover crops to suppress nematodes in potatoes[21] potatoes[21]
  Crop rotationMain article:
 Crop rotation rotation
 Satellite image of circular crop fields in Haskell County, Kansas in late June 2001.
 Healthy, growing crops of corn and sorghum are green (Sorghum may be slightly paler).
 Wheat is brilliant gold.
 Fields of brown have been recently harvested and plowed under or have lain in fallow for the year.Crop rotation or crop sequencing is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of crops in the same space in sequential seasons for various benefits such as to avoid the build up of pathogens and pests that often occurs when one species is continuously cropped.
 Crop rotation also seeks to balance the fertility demands of various crops to avoid excessive depletion of soil nutrients.
 A traditional component of crop rotation is the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of green manure in sequence with cereals and other crops.
 It is one component of polyculture.
 Crop rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants.
  Water use efficiencyMain article:
 Water conservation conservation
 Overhead irrigation, center pivot designCrop irrigation accounts for 70% of the world's fresh water use.[22] The agricultural sector of most countries is important both economically and politically, and water subsidies are common.
 Conservation advocates have urged removal of all subsidies to force farmers to grow more water-efficient crops and adopt less wasteful irrigation techniques.
 Optimal water efficiency means minimizing losses due to evaporation, runoff or subsurface drainage.
 An evaporation pan can be used to determine how much water is required to irrigate the land.
 Flood irrigation, the oldest and most common type, is often very uneven in distribution, as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts.
 Overhead irrigation, using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers, gives a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern.
 Drip irrigation is the most expensive and least-used type, but offers the best results in delivering water to plant roots with minimal losses.
 As changing irrigation systems can be a costly undertaking, conservation efforts often concentrate on maximizing the efficiency of the existing system.
 This may include chiseling compacted soils, creating furrow dikes to prevent runoff, and using soil moisture and rainfall sensors to optimize irrigation schedules.[23] schedules.[23]
 Water catchment management measures include recharge pits, which capture rainwater and runoff and use it to recharge ground water supplies.
 This helps in the formation of ground water wells, etc.
 and eventually reduces soil erosion caused due to running water.
  Nutrient auditsBetter nutrient audits allow farmers to spend less money on nutrients and to create less pollution since less nutrient is added to the soil and thus there is less to run off and pollute.
 Methodologies for assessing soil nutrient balances have been studied and used for farms and entire countries for decades.[24] But at present "there is no standard methodology for calculating nutrient budgets and there are no accepted 'benchmarks' figures against which to assess farm nutrient use efficiency.
 [A standard methodology] for calculating nutrient budgets on farms [is hoped to help reduce] diffuse water and air pollution from agriculture [through] best management practices in the use of fertilisers and organic manures, as part of the continued development of economically and environmentally sustainable farming systems."[25][dead link] link]
  Herbicide resistanceMain article:
 Weed control control
 In agriculture, large scale and systematic weeding is usually required, often performed by machines such as cultivators or liquid herbicide sprayers.
 Selective herbicides kill specific targets while leaving the desired crop relatively unharmed.
 Some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed and are often based on plant hormones.
 Weed control through herbicide is made more difficult when the weeds become resistant to the herbicide.
 Solutions include:
 using cover crops (especially those with allelopathic properties) that out-compete weeds and/or inhibit their regeneration.
 using a different herbicide herbicide
 using a different crop (e.g.
 genetically altered to be herbicide resistant; which ironically can create herbicide resistant weeds through horizontal gene transfer) transfer)
 using a different variety (e.g.
 locally adapted variety that resists, tolerates, or even out-competes weeds) weeds)
 ploughing ploughing
 ground cover such as mulch or plastic plastic
 manual removal removal

 Whether in the spiritual or physical plane �we are what we eat�.
 All our energy is ultimately sourced from food.
 The nutritional value of the food we eat, its ecological and social costs (the chemicals and processes used in growing it, the distance it travels before reaching our plates), and our relationship to the producers�all affect us.
 Modern chemical-based farming depletes soil fertility, impoverishes farmers and has made them dependent on corporations for all farm inputs from hybrid seeds to fertilizers and pesticides.
 Pesticide residues left on our produce cause innumerable health hazards, besides the ill effects of these toxins contaminating our water resources due to run-off and seepage into the ground.
 Ultimately these toxic chemicals enter the eco-system and cause harm to the entire food chain, from insects and birds to the larger predator species.
 Organic food is healthier for our bodies, better for farmers� livelihoods and does not destroy ecological balance as does chemical-based farming.
 Organic farmers use low-external input, sustainable techniques and thus incur less debt since they control most farming inputs.
 Thus encouraging small, local organic farming is essential to restoring our food, livelihood and health security.
 Organic food tastes better too! too!
 Keep chemicals out of our bodies.
 Many foods have residues of poisonous chemicals used as pesticides in their production.
 Many systemic pesticides cannot be removed by washing.
 Numerous studies show that pesticides can adversely affect the nervous system, increase the risk of cancer, and decrease fertility fertility
 Protect future generations.
 Before a mother first breastfeeds her newborn, the toxic risk from pesticides has already begun.
 Studies show that infants are exposed to hundreds of harmful chemicals in-utero.
 Organically grown food is safe food, free from the dangers of poisons and chemicals, which is especially important for children, who have a lower body weight than adults and developing systems and brains.
 Better Nutrition, Better Taste.
 Fresh organic produce contains more vitamins, minerals, enzymes and antioxidants than chemically produced food.
 Organic foods are also consistently judged tastier.
 4.
 Reduce Environmental Pollution.
 Chemical agriculture wreaks havoc on the environment.
 Pesticides seep into groundwater, and can cause loss of aquatic life, birds and wildlife.
 Chemical fertilizer dependency has taken a toll on the natural health of the soil.
 5.
 Support Farmer�s Livelihoods.
 Organic farming reduces dependency on external inputs like seeds, fertilizers and pesticides.
 Instead they are produced from cowdung, bio-mass, beneficial herbs and leaves.
 Dependence on expensive inputs purchased from outside leads to financial distress of farmers.
 vegetables juice juice
 6.
 Protect the health of farmers.
 Close and continuous contact with agricultural poisons makes farmers more susceptible to cancer, respiratory problems and other major diseases.
 India�s farmers are exposed to numerous pesticides including Endosulfan that are banned in developed countries.
 Many farmers turn to organic methods after experiencing the ill-effects of pesticides.
 7.
 Promote native seed diversity.
 Traditional seeds developed by Indian farmers are naturally pest-resistant, nutritious and suited to local conditions.
 Chemical farming promotes the use of Hybrid non-native seeds.
 8.
 Avoid eating genetically modified (GM) food.
 Organic standards do not allow any genetically modified seeds and inputs.
 GM foods, if approved for the market in India, cannot be distinguished from other foods.
 Going organic is the sure way to know your foods are free of GMOs GMOs
 9.
 Promote Biodiversity.
 Visit an organic farm and you�ll notice something:
 a buzz of animal, bird and insect activity.
 Native plants, birds and hawks return usually after the first season of organic practices.
 10.
 Avoid hormones, antibiotics and drugs in animal products.
 Dairy cows and meat animals are routinely injected with growth hormones and anitbiotics.
 These get passed into the milk /meat we consume and harm the health, especially of children who consume them.
 Traditional Agricultural Systems Systems
 Demands for an increase in food production were initially met by expanding the area being cultivated or horizontal expansion.
 The cropland area increased from 265 million hectares (Mha) prior to the Industrial Revolution in 1700 to 1,500 Mha in 1980, representing an increase of 5.7 times in less than three centuries.
 (One hectare equals 2.47 acres.) The scarcity of new land for crop production necessitated increasing crop production per unit area and time from the same land.
 This need for agricultural intensification, or vertical expansion, has been satisfied by the use of chemical fertilizers, supplemental irrigation, improved cultivars, and intensive cropping systems.
 Soil fertility refers to reserves of plant nutrients (e.g., N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu, Mo, S, and B) in the root zone and their availability to cultivated plants in accord with physiological needs.
 Most ancient civilizations evolved on soils with built-in fertility rejuvenation mechanisms.
 These included alluvial soils along the floodplains of major rivers (e.g., the Nile, Indus, Euphrates, and Tigris) or loess soils with a continuous source of plant nutrients through wind-blown materials (e.g., the Loess Plateau of China).
 With an increase in population, agriculture expanded into other regions where the nutrient supply was not renewed on a regular basis by flood water or wind deposits.
 In regions with adequate water supply, nutrients stored in the forest biomass were released for crop production through the "slash and burn" method.
 Soil fertility was restored by land rotation or shifting cultivation in which a short cultivation period of two to three years was followed by long fallow or a rest period of fertility restoration.
 The land was used extensively and productivity was low.
 In these systems, farms were small and based on mixed farming systems with the close integration of crops with livestock.
 This involved the incorporation of hay or meadows in the rotation cycle.
 Crop residues and hay were fed to livestock and manure redistributed on the land.
 With the wide availability of fertilizers since World War II, farms in North America and other developed economies have become larger, leading to the increased predominance of monoculture and the elimination of hay and meadows from the rotation cycle.
 Animal production operations have become specialized, based on feedlot, creating a problem of manure management on the one hand and depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock on the other.
 Soil Fertility Enhancement by Chemical Fertilizers Fertilizers
 The use of supplemental nutrients to increase crop yield started as trial and error in the form of wood ashes, ground bones, salt peter, and gypsum.
 Justus von Liebig (1803�1873), a German chemist, laid the foundation for the use of chemical fertilizers as a source of plant nutrients starting in 1840.
 He recognized the importance of various mineral elements derived from the soil in plant nutrition and the necessity of replacing those elements in order to maintain soil fertility.
 Gilbert, in turn established the agricultural experiment station at Rothamsted, in the United Kingdom.
 They built on the work of Liebig and experimentally demonstrated the importance of chemical fertilizers in improving and maintaining soil fertility.
 In fact, the application of synthetic fertilizers was the basis of the global increase in agricultural production after World War II.
 Global fertilizer use was merely 27 million tons in 1959 and 1960; it increased five times to 141 million metric tons over the forty-year period ending in 2000.
 The projected fertilizer demand for the year 2020 is 220 million metric tons.
  Pesticides is the second largest agent causing cancer, next to cigarettes.
 Intensive fertilizer use on input-responsive cultivars grown on prime irrigated land was the basis of the green revolution in South Asia and elsewhere that saved millions from hunger and malnutrition.
 As the world population increases and cropland becomes more valuable, total cropland acreage is beginning to diminish, increasing the reliance on fertilizer.
 Similar to fertilizer use, there has also been a rapid increase in global pesticide use.
 In fact, much of the success of the green revolution depended on the use of pesticides.
 Global pesticide use was four million tons in 1970, five million tons in 1985, and six million tons in 2001.
 As much as 85 percent of all pesticides are used in agriculture.
 The misuse of pesticides can cause severe environmental problems, especially in developing countries.
 It is estimated that chemical pollution in agriculture costs about $100 billion in diverse public health and environmental damage each year worldwide.
 The health risks are due to a lack of or inadequate occupational and other safety standards, insufficient enforcement, poor labeling, illiteracy, and insufficient knowledge about the hazards of pesticides and fertilizers.
 Supplemental irrigation has been used to raise crops in arid regions since 9500 to 8000 B .
 C .
 E .Irrigated agriculture developed in the Middle East, South Asia, China, and in Central and South America.
 Irrigation played a major role in increasing food production during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
 Irrigated land area had expanded to 275 Mha by 1998.
 Worldwide, 17 percent of irrigated cropland produces 40 percent of the world's food.
 The leakage of fertilizers into the environment adversely impacts water quality (i.e., nonpoint source pollution) and exacerbates the greenhouse effect (i.e., emission of N 2 O and NO x ).
 Fertilizer use efficiency can be enhanced by the adoption of conservation tillage and incorporation of cover crops in the rotation cycle.
 Cover crops include grass species sown between the main crops to improve soil quality and increase the SOC pool, or leguminous crops that enhance soil fertility through biological nitrogen fixation.
 Species of Graminaceae and Cruciferae are nitrate catch crops and produce biosolids/residues to be used as mulch.
 Nitrate catch crops minimize the leaching of nitrates available in the soil, and undersown catch crops are more efficient than those established after the harvest of main crops.
 Agriculture and the Environment Environment
 Inappropriate land use, soil mismanagement (especially the practice of plowing and growing monoculture with the subsequent need for large amounts of pesticides), and the adoption of fertility-mining practices can have adverse impacts on the environment, including the eutrophication of surface water, contamination of ground water, and emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from agricultural ecosystems into the atmosphere.
 Processes that lead to environmental pollution include accelerated erosion, leaching, volatilization, mineralization of organic matter, methanogenesis , and denitrification.
 These processes are accentuated by the conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems, biomass burning, plowing and other excessive soil disturbance, indiscriminate use of fertilizers and other farm chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides, and drainage of wetlands.
 Nonetheless, these activities were deemed necessary to increase agricultural productivity to meet the demands of an increased population during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
 Intensive Commercial Agriculture in Developed Countries.
 Agricultural pollution in developed countries such as the United States is caused by the excessive use of chemicals.
 In the United States, the use of synthetic pesticides since 1945 has grown thirty-three-fold to about 0.5 billion kilograms (kg) per year or 3 kg per hectare per year.
 Further, the increase in hazard is even greater than it might appear because the toxicity of modern pesticides has increased by more than ten-fold over those pesticides used in the early 1950s.
 U.S.
 data show that 18 percent of all pesticides and about 90 percent of all fungicides are carcinogenic.
 In addition to humans, thousands of domestic animals are also poisoned by pesticides in the United States.
 The destruction of natural predators and parasites is costing the nation more than $500 million each year and resulting in the development of pesticide resistance.
 Ground and surface water contamination from pesticides is a serous issue.
 The excessive use of fertilizers and plowing can cause the eutrophication of water and transport sediment-borne chemicals into surface water.
 The average fertilizer use is about 100 kg per hectare per year in North America and 200 kg per hectare per year in western Europe.
 If use efficiency is less than 60 percent, a large proportion of the fertilizer applied ends up in surface and ground waters, or as a gaseous emission (N 2 O and NO 2 ) into the atmosphere.
 Low-Input Agriculture in Developing Countries.
 The shifting cultivation and related bush-fallow systems, practiced in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere in the tropics, rely on cycling nutrients accumulated in vegetation and the soil surface during the fallow period.
 Deforestation and biomass burning emit large quantities of particulate matter and GHGs into the atmosphere.
 Further, the mineralization of SOC to release plant-available nutrients (e.g., N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, etc.) gives off CO 2 and other GHGs into the atmosphere.
 The release of 50 kg of N per hectare through the decomposition of soil organic mater would lead to the emission of 500 kg of CO 2 -C, if we assume a conservative C:N ratio of 10:1.
 The problem is drastically exacerbated by accelerated soil erosion, which is a widespread problem due to harsh climate and fragile soils.
 Soil nutrient depletion at a continental scale continues to be a major problem in Africa, with severe economic and environmental consequences.
 The average annual nutrient loss on arable land in Africa was 22 kg N per hectare, 2.5 kg P per hectare, and 15 kg K per hectare.
 Intensive Agriculture in Developing Economies.
 The rapidly growing human population in Asia (particularly in the southern or eastern regions of the continent) has jeopardized the environment and natural resources, which are already under great stress.
 Consequently, off-farm input (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, plowing) plays an important role in food production in India, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, etc.
 In India, approximately 59 million kg of pesticides are applied to agriculture annually.
 The average rate of fertilizer application in East Asia is 240 kg per hectare per year.
 Because of N subsidies, for example, farmers apply the cheap N pesticide and do not consider using the more expensive but less toxic P and K products.
 Consequently, there is a nutrient mining of soil in intensive rice-wheat areas.
 Further, highly soluble chemicals are quickly leached into the ground water.
 India is one of only two countries worldwide (along with the United States) to have applied more than 100,000 tons of dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) since its initial formulation.
 Because of the excessive and indiscriminate use of pesticides in India, the total intake of organochemicals per person in that country is the highest in the world.
 Despite the problems outlined here, the adoption of recommended agricultural practices (RMPs) can enhance food production with minimal risks to the environment.
 In addition to the use of improved varieties responsive to input, RMPs include conservation-till or no-till farming involving cover crops in the rotation cycle, integrated nutrient management based on a judicious use of chemical fertilizers in combination with manures and other biosolids, precision farming to apply nutrient and chemicals based on soil-specific needs, soil-water management through drip irrigation/fertilization, or subirrigation through controlled water table management, etc.
 The objective is agricultural intensification on existing land.
 It means cultivating the best soil with the best management practices to produce the optimum sustainable yield and save agriculturally marginal lands for nature conservancy.
 Sustainable Agriculture Agriculture
 There are numerous, diverse, and increasing demands on agriculture in the twenty-first century.
 In addition to meeting the demands for the economic production of food, feed, fiber, and fuel, agriculture of the twenty-first century must also address environmental concerns, especially in regard to water quality and the accelerated greenhouse effect.
 Soil is a biofilter, and a reduction in the thickness of the topsoil layer through erosion has a direct negative effect on the buffering and filtering capacity of the soil and on the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
 Soil erosion preferentially removes soil organic matter because it is light and is concentrated in the surface layer.
 A large fraction of the C thus displaced by water runoff may be prone to mineralization, leading to its emission into the atmosphere as CO 2 .
 It is estimated that globally 1.1 billion tons of C may be emitted annually as CO 2 because of displacement by water erosion.
 In addition, some of the organic matter deposited in depressional sites and aquatic ecosystems may lead to the emission of methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O).
 In comparison to CO 2 , the global warming potential is twenty-one for CH 4 and 310 for N 2 O.
 Sustainable agriculture, therefore, is a viable production system based on environmentally benign agricultural practices.
 The objective of sustainable agriculture is to enhance and sustain production while improving soil fertility, soil tilth, and soil health.
 While enhancing production, sustainable agriculture must also address environmental issues with regard to water quality and the greenhouse effect.
 Rather than being the cause, improved agriculture is a solution to certain environmental problems.
 Sustainable agriculture implies profitable farming on a continuous basis while preserving the natural resource base.
 It is not synonymous with low-input, organic, or alternative agriculture.
 In some cases, low input may sustain profitable and environmentally sound farming.
 In others, it might not.
 The addition of organic amendments might enhance soil quality, but may not eliminate the need for the judicious use of fertilizers.
 Large quantities (10 to 20 ton/hectare/year) of organic manures are needed to supply enough nutrients to produce the desired yields.
 Therefore, the use of organic manures, although desirable, may not be logistically feasible.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, low inputs on impoverished soils and low yields have been responsible for low standards of living, severe malnutrition, and widespread problems of soil and environmental degradation.
 Therefore, the adoption of RMPs is a necessary prerequisite to feeding the earth's expected ten billion inhabitants by the year 2100.
 Judicious management includes the conversion of marginal agricultural soils to restorative land use and adoption of RMPs.
 Technological options differ among soils, ecoregions, and social and cultural settings, but the underlying basic principles remain the same.

 Organic farming is an age old practice in India which got disturbed during First Generation Green Revolution.
 Organic manure has been practiced in Indian agriculture since the Vedic period.
 Sir Albert Howard, a British Agronomist, however, started the organic agriculture way back in 1900.
 In organic farming, farm is viewed as an economy.
 It is a way of farming which excludes the use of off-farm inputs such as chemical fertilizer, pesticides, insecticides etc and is primarily based on the principle:
 use of natural organic inputs and biological plant protection measures.
 Properly managed organic farming reduces or eliminates water pollution and helps conserve water and soil on the farm thereby enhances sustainability and agro-biodiversity.
 Indian farmers have an inherent understanding of how to work closely with the nature, because only 30 per cent of India�s total cultivable area is covered with fertilizers because of assured irrigation and the balance 70 per cent of arable land is mainly rain-fed with little or zero use of fertilizer.
 It isn�t a profit oriented but social-profit oriented.
 Commitment to nature protection is a pre-requisite to organic farming.
 India has comparative advantage over many other countries because of the vast cultivated area, which has remained free of contamination from chemicals, spread over distinctly varying agro climatic conditions, for example, large area in north-east region, northern hills and rain fed regions with very low or zero use of agro chemicals, can be instantly converted to organic farming.
 Farmers in these areas often use organic manure as a source of nutrients that are readily available either in their own farm or in their locality.
 Organic farming is based upon an integrated relationship among soil, minerals, water, plants, micro flora, insects, animals and human beings.
 It creates productive landscapes and successfully reconciles food production and environmental conservation.
 Organic management relies on local human resources and knowledge to enhance natural resource processes, respecting ecological carrying capacities.
 By reducing dependence on off-farm inputs and creating more balanced nutrient and energy flows, ecosystem resilience is strengthened, food security is increased and additional income are generated.
 Organic farming responds positively to all sustainable agriculture and rural development objectives and helps in maintaining soil fertility to improve crop production and socio-economic conditions of the farmers.
 One of the biggest rewards of organic farming is healthy soil that is alive with beneficial organisms.
 These healthy microbes, fungi and bacteria keep the harmful bacteria and fungi that cause diseases in check.
 Organic farmers, working with nature, build soil that protects their crops from diseases.
 They also try to be diligent about crop rotation.
 They do not plant the same crop in the same location repeatedly, which encourages the build-up of diseases and pests that plague that particular crop.
 Excessive application of pesticides and fertilizers has caused damage to the soil and environment besides affecting crop production.
 The consumption of pesticides and fertilizer over the period of time has increased substantially.
 Pesticides is the second largest agent causing cancer, next to cigarettes.
 Besides, the pesticides and fertilizers residuals that persist in the soil are harmful to the beneficial soil micro organism and earthworms thereby resulting in degradation of soil fertility.
 Fertilizers have a short term positive effect on productivity but a long term negative effect on the environment where they remain for years after leaching and running off, contaminating ground water and water bodies.
 In the name of growing more to feed the earth, we have taken the wrong path to sustainability.
 The effects have already been noticed:
 farmers committing suicide in growing numbers every passing year.
 Another negative effect of this trend has been on the fortunes of the farming communities� around the globe.
 Despite the so-called increase in productivity, farmers practically every where around the globe have seen downtimes in their fortunes.
 Pesticides residue controversies in the recent past in the bottled drinking water as well in the aerated beverages in India hardly come as a surprise.
 Pesticides, a non-bio-degradable but highly toxic, find their ways into ground water and water bodies contaminating them and rendering them unfit for human consumption.
 Pesticides go into the water in the first place only because of the practiced agricultural system.
 The pesticides problem compounded in India because many pesticides banned abroad are manufactured/ dumped and sold freely in India.
 Organic in agriculture is a labeling term that denotes products have been produced in accordance with certain standards during food production, handling, processing and marketing stages, and certified by a duly constituted certification authority or body.
 The certification of organic farms is required to satisfy the consumers that the product is totally organic.
 Certification agency conducts the inspection that minimum requirements prescribed for organic agriculture is fully met and issues certificates.
 The formation of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movement (IFOAM) in 1972 gave an international framework for the discussion and codification of internationally recognized principles of organic farming.
 FAO-WHO has officially declared that International guidelines on organically produced food products should be considered important for consumer protection and information as they facilitate trade.
 The Codex Alimentarious Commission, a joint FAO-WHO food standards programme, body that sets international food standards, started to develop guidelines for the production, processing, labeling and marketing of organically produced food in 1991.
 The Codex guidelines are important for equivalent judgments under the rule of World Trade Organization (WTO).
 The Codex Alimentarious Commission defines organic agriculture as a holistic food production management system, which promotes and enhances agro ecosystem health including biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity.
 It emphasizes the use of management practices in preference to the use of farm inputs, taking into account that regional conditions require locally adapted systems.
 But the commercial organic farming in India is still at a nascent stage.
 According to IFOAM - SOEL (Stiftung Oekologie & Landbau) survey of February 2005, India has about 76,326 hectare of land under organic management managed by about 5147 certified organic farms , which is only 0.05 per cent of total agricultural land.
 According to Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), a nodal agency involved in promoting Indian organic agriculture, about 67292 tons of organic products worth of Rs 7123 lakhs are being exported from India.
 According to APEDA, India has 2508 thousand of hectare area under organic farming including herbs collections from the forest area of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh (2432500 hectare) producing 119656 tons of organic products, 165700 numbers of seedlings and cuttings and 264000 litres of effective micro organism.
 The Indian organic farming industry is estimated at US $ 20 millions and is almost entirely export oriented.
 But there are a number of farms in India which have either never been chemically managed/ cultivated or has converted back to organic farming because of their farmers� beliefs or purely for reason of economics.
 These thousands of farmers cultivating hundreds of thousands of acres of land are not classified as organic though they are.
 Their produce either sells in the open market along with conventionally grown produce at the same price or sells purely on goodwill and trust as organic through selected outlets and regular specialist bazaars.
 These farmers may never opt for certification because of the costs involved as well as the extensive documentation that is required by certifiers.
 Can organic farming feed the world isn�t a question.
 The real question is:
 Can we feed the world better?
 Organic farming yields other benefits in which the external costs of organic farming-erosion, chemical pollution to drinking water and death of birds are one third of the conventional farming.
 There is another argument which is relevant to India.
 Because organic farming does not depend on extensive inputs, it might help shift the balance towards smaller farmers.
 The organically produced food items are superior in quality aspects as compared to synthetic chemicals.
 They are good in taste, flavor, and essential nutrients and at the same time, they are free from harmful or toxic chemicals.
 The use of pesticides has led to high levels of chemicals in the soil, water, air and even our bodies.
 Fertilizers have a short term effect on productivity but a long term negative effect on the environment contaminating water bodies.
 In fact organic farming is another revolution emerging as Viable Alternative of Farming.
 It has the potential to transform agriculture as the main tool for nature conservation.
 Large scale shift to organic farming would bring better results and not reduce the supply of food gains which is the apprehension among few scientists.
 Indian farmers and the traders can exploit the huge demand, both the domestic as well as global market for organic products.
 To promote and develop the Indian organic movement and to maintain its quality system at par with the international standard as to receive reciprocal approval from other countries, a National Programme of Organic Production (NPOP) has been launched which provides an institutional mechanism for the improvement of National Standards for organic products through a National Accreditation Policy and Programmes.
 In order to provide reorganization to organic products destined for export to the US, APEDA on the behalf of Ministry of Commerce (MOC) had initiated a process of equivalence of Indian Standard under NPOP with US standards since May 2002.
 Recently, USAD has agreed to recognize our accreditation system and the certificate of organic agricultural product by certification bodies accredited under NPOP for import of organic product into US with effect from February 16, 2006.
 USAD has accepted affixing the Indian Organic seal along with USAD organic seal on Indian products as well as certificate.
 This will help the exporter by reducing the cost of certification which they have to pay to the international agencies.
 Indian Organic seal is thus going to gain popularity.
 Indian farmers and traders can exploit the huge domestic as well as international market for organic products because eating organic foods help reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
 This manual in Hindi developed by Rajinder Chaudhary on natural farming, also known as organic, zero budget or alternative farming, is an attempt to spread awareness among Indian farmers about the above sustainable agriculture methods.
 Conventional agricultural practices with an undue emphasis on intensive use of water, chemical fertilisers and high investments has led many farmers into a debt trap.
 Natural farming is presented as the solution to the burning problems of farmers in the context of the crisis facing Indian agriculture because of rising input costs, uncertain yields and output prices, spurious seeds/ fertilizers/ pesticides/ herbicides and damage to environment due to unsustainable farming practices.
 The thrust of the manual is on discussing the inputs from natural materials and on how to heal the soil slashed by chemicals, herbicide and machines.
 It presents how an ecology that recovered the natural balance will drop in the pests and disease occurrence.
 The report highlights cases with yields similar to those of chemical agriculture.
 The techniques for preventing soil erosion, holding moisture, propagating micro-organisms, producing organic fertilizer, improving soil ventilation and suppressing the pests are discussed.
 Experiences of some farmers who have adopted natural farming methods particularly in Punjab are also chronicled.
 The author has visited these farms and held discussions with experts on the subject to arrive at the following - -
 �An essential aspect of natural farming is to let nature play a dominant role to the maximum extent possible.
 �Unlike other agricultural practices, this method of farming does away with the use of pesticides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers, agricultural machinery and other external inputs.
 �No tilling is practiced along with use of natural fertilizers, soil improvers, pest controllers and disease cure methods - all made by the farmers themselves using only natural materials such as earthworms, microorganisms and small animals.
 �Natural farming inputs substitute Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, Calcium and all other elements that would be commonly given in the form of chemical fertilizer.
 The report takes into account the recent developments in science to fine tune its methods particularly related to seed treatment.
 The initial drawback of the natural farming method being labour intensive also diminishes with time.
 This document is to communicate to stakeholders the decision to uncouple fertilizer-pesticide combination products intended for lawn and turf uses.
 2.0 Scope Scope
 This regulatory action is focussed on the lawn and turf uses of fertilizer-pesticide combination products on the following types of turf:
 �Lawn turf planted in or around residences, as well as public and commercial buildings including schools and cemeteries cemeteries
 �Sports and recreational turf such as turf in parks, playgrounds, golf courses, zoos, botanical gardens and athletic playing fields fields
 These types of turf are collectively known as fine turf, which may be maintained by homeowners or by professional applicators.
 This regulatory action does not include agricultural uses of fertilizer-pesticide combination products (turf farms), or products that have a single active material with both fertilizer and pesticidal properties.
 3.0 Background Background
 Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) regulates pesticides under the Pest Control Products Act including those intended for lawn and turf uses.
 All pesticide products that are registered for use and sale in Canada have undergone rigorous health and environmental risk assessments including the pesticides present in fertilizer-pesticide combinations.
 Pesticides are often combined with fertilizers and sold as fertilizer-pesticide combination products, which are regulated by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency under the Fertilizers Act.
 When pesticides are combined with fertilizer such that the two components can only be applied at the same time and to the same area, the delivery mechanism for the pesticide component is brought into question.
 The very nature of combination products removes the flexibility of applying the pesticide as a spot application due to the need to accommodate the fertilizer, which is designed for broadcast application to the entire lawn surface at specified times of the year.
 Pesticides should only be used when and where there is a need.
 Broadcast applications of pesticides over the whole area are warranted only for severe pest infestations that are widespread.
 As pest infestations are typically patchy, spot applications of pesticides to those areas are most often sufficient to ensure adequate control in turf.
 To be effective, fertilizers and pesticides must each be applied at the appropriate timings, which typically do not coincide.
 Fertilizers are most often applied in spring or early summer, and/or in late summer or fall.
 A spring-applied lawn fertilizer results in increased tillering and rapid growth as temperatures increase, resulting in turf of increased density.
 A fall-applied lawn fertilizer also results in increased tillering and may result in increased winter hardiness.
 The majority of pesticides found in pesticide-fertilizer combination products are broadleaf herbicides belonging to the synthetic auxin group of chemicals.
 This group of chemicals only controls broadleaf weeds that have emerged and are actively growing in the lawn.
 These herbicides are not preventative in that they will only control weeds that have emerged and they do not prevent weeds from becoming established in the lawn.
 Further, this group of chemicals is not long lasting in that they do not persist in the soil to prevent future weed infestations.
 Combination products have been purchased for their convenience and ease of use as a two-in-one product to address separate lawn maintenance issues (for example, nutrient deficiency and various pest infestations) with a single application.
 However, these products are unsuitable as a delivery mechanism because they support broadcast application of the pesticide when this might not be warranted.
 Ultimately, fertilizer and pesticide applications should be based on need.
 Fertilizer should only be used if the turf will benefit from additional nutrients, and pesticide should only be used as a broadcast treatment if the pest densities are sufficiently high across the area to be treated.
 Targeted, well-timed liquid formulations of pesticides minimize pesticide use on the lawn and turf sites.
 4.0 Regulatory decision decision
 Based on consultation with the provinces, experts and registrants, the PMRA has concluded that fertilizer-pesticide combination products for lawn and turf uses do not support the goals of best practices for pest management in turf.
 The PMRA, in conjunction with Canadian Food Inspection Agency, is taking action to uncouple the fertilizer-pesticide combination products intended for lawn and turf uses.
 A date of last sale of 31 December 2012 for fertilizer-pesticide combination products for lawn and turf uses has been set in order to allow for replacement products to be made available where needed.
 Should situations arise to warrant the use of a fertilizer-pesticide combination product for lawn and turf uses, the PMRA will assess combination products in terms of the timing of application and flexibility to apply as a spot treatment, as well as potential risks to human health and the environment.
 The PMRA decision to uncouple fertilizer-pesticide combination products is not based on the health or environmental risk assessments but rather the nature of combination products.
 Combination products remove the flexibility of applying spot applications of the pesticide due to the need to accommodate the fertilizer, which is designed for broadcast application to the entire lawn surface at specified times of the year.
 Turf fertilizers will continue to be available for broadcast application when needed.
 Pesticide-only products will also continue to be available for lawn care use to homeowners and commercial applicators for either spot treatments of localized weed patches or for use as broadcast applications to severely infested turf areas when warranted.
 Although more time consuming, pest control in lawn and turf can be achieved with careful pesticide spot applications that target only the pests that are present and separate broadcast applications of fertilizers.
 The natural mix of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, such as occurs when agricultural chemicals seep into groundwater, may have a broad range of effects on human and animal health, a new study shows.
 The study, published in the current issue of the journal Toxicology and Industrial Health, suggests that combinations of commonly used agricultural chemicals, in concentrations that mirror levels found in groundwater, can significantly influence the immune and endocrine systems as well as neurological health.
 Conducted over five years, the study of mice suggests that current methods used by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others for studying the toxic effects of low-levels of pesticides may be flawed.
 "The single most important finding of the study is that common mixtures, not the standard one-chemical-at-a-time experiments, can show biological effects at current concentrations in groundwater," said Warren P.
 Porter, the lead author of the study and a UW-Madison professor of zoology and environmental toxicology.
 Although used worldwide, "tests for these compounds in combination are very rare, although they frequently co-occur." co-occur."
 The experiments performed by Porter's group suggest that children and the developing fetus are most at risk from the pesticide-fertilizer mixtures.
 Their influence on developing neurological, endocrine and immune systems, said Porter, portend change in ability to learn and in patterns of aggression.
 The privately funded Wisconsin study focused on three commonly used farm chemicals:
 aldicarb, an insecticide; atrazine, a herbicide; and nitrate, a chemical fertilizer.
 All three are in wide use worldwide and are the most ubiquitous contaminants of groundwater in the United States.
 In the series of experiments, when mice were given drinking water laced with combinations of pesticides and nitrate, they exhibited altered immune, endocrine and nervous system functions.
 Those changes, according to Porter, occurred at concentrations currently found in groundwater.
 Effects were most noticeable when a single pesticide was combined with nitrate fertilizer.
 This was true for herbicide as well as insecticide, said Porter, and chips away at the notion that herbicides have no significant influence on animals.
 "Herbicides can have neurological impacts and hormonal impacts and immune impacts," he said.
 "They are not the harmless chemicals they are sometimes portrayed to be.
 They can be every bit as biologically active as insecticides or fungicides." fungicides."
 The apparent influence of pesticide and fertilizer mixtures on the endocrine system -- the system of glands such as the thyroid that secrete hormones into the bloodstream -- may have a cascade effect, spilling over to the immune system and affecting fetal brain development.
 "Thyroid disruption in humans has multiple consequences," Porter said.
 Some of these include effects on brain development, level of irritability, sensitivity to stimuli, ability or motivation to learn, and altered immune function.
 A curious finding of the study is that animals may be more vulnerable to the influence of such chemicals depending on the time of year:
 "Our current working hypothesis is that animals are seasonally vulnerable because of subtle modulation of natural seasonal variation in hormone levels," according to Porter.
 "For example, thyroid hormone level varies seasonally and we have now shown that two different chemical mixtures will modulate thyroid hormone levels." levels."
 The new study, Porter contends, adds to a growing body of evidence that current testing methods required for the registration and use of chemical pesticides are fundamentally flawed.
 In addition to a lack of testing of combinations of chemical compounds, Porter said there is a narrow focus on looking principally for carcinogenic effects or obvious cell mutations.
 Neurological, immune and endocrine tests for pesticides have been mandated by federal law for almost three years, but there has been no enforcement of these laws, Porter said.
 "Toxicological testing so far has been extremely limited in scope and focused on mechanisms that require extensive mutations or cell damage to show any effects.
 They do not adequately assess the potential for biological effects under real world exposure scenarios." scenarios."
 Co-authors of the paper include James W.
 Jaeger of the UW-Madison Department of Zoology, and Ian H.
 Carlson of the Endocrinology Laboratory, University of Wisconsin Hospital.
 As of January 1, 2010 products containing a combination of fertilizer and herbicide (commonly known as weed and feed) will no longer be available for sale or use in Alberta.
 View Fact Sheet.
 Since weed and feed is applied to an entire lawn, regardless of the size of the weed infestation, it results in an over-application of the herbicide 2,4-D.
 Herbicide-only products will still be available for spot application, as they result in less surplus chemical draining from the lawn, running into storm sewers and entering waterways.
 A list of the fertilizer-herbicide products affected by the ban has been derived from the record of all fertilizer-pesticide combination products (such as herbicide, insecticide or fungicide) registered with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.
 If new fertilizer-herbicide products are approved for use in Canada after this list was created, new products would also be subject to the ban in Alberta.
 �Fertilizers only containing corn gluten meal and referred to as a weed and feed are NOT subject to this ban.
 �Fertilizers that are enhanced with fungicides and do not contain herbicides are NOT included in the ban.
 �Fertilizers enhanced with micronutrients that have herbicidal effects (eg.
 iron sulfate, copper, sulphur), but not herbicides are NOT included in the ban.
 Some national retailers with stores in Alberta have removed products in addition to the ones that have been banned, such as insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and rodenticides.
 These products are not affected by the provincial weed and feed ban.
 Consumers may want to check with the store about specific products or with other retail outlets and garden centres to determine whether these products are available elsewhere.
 As an extension of our Turfgrass Chemical Updates, Grounds Maintenance publishes additional Chemical Updates throughout the year.
 Extensive information about chemical characteristics and pests controlled is found in the first three Updates, published in January, February and March.
 However, these Updates cover only straight chemical products.
 To provide a reference for those of you who rely on combination products, we've compiled a listing of pesticide/fertilizer combinations.
 These tables do not cross reference chemicals with pests controlled or other information.
 That information can be found in our prior Updates.
 These lists simply provide an overview of available products, including fertilizer analysis, percent active ingredient and available brands.
 Often, suppliers formulate an active ingredient with numerous fertilizer analyses, or custom blend the combination.
 In these cases, rather than provide a long list of analyses, we simply note �various� in the Analysis column.

 An obvious advantage of combination products is that you can fertilize and control pests with a single application.
 This is a great labor saver, but it requires you to carefully formulate your management strategy.
 Combination products require appropriate timing for both the fertilizer and the chemical.
 Because the rates of the fertilizer and the pesticide are linked, you sacrifice some flexibility.
 For example, you could not put the product down a little heavier for some extra fertility, because doing so would probably violate the label instructions.
 However, when timing and rates mesh properly, there's no way to beat the economy of one granular application to make two treatments.
 Pre-emergence herbicides dominate the available combination products.
 This makes sense, because turf managers typically apply pre-emergents at about the same time as fertilizers (in spring, for example) and in a similar manner (by spreader).
 That's why most major pre-emergents are available in combination with fertilizers.
 Post-emergence herbicides also are available with fertilizers.
 These, of course, are the popular �weed-and-feed� products that have been around for many years.
 Though perhaps more popular in the retail market, these products also are available to commercial operators.
 Insecticides comprise a much smaller number of combination products.
 However, if you're looking for grub controls, you'll find no shortage of options.
 Though relatively few in number, several valuable fungicides are available in combination with fertilizer.
 When you use combination products, don't forget that you are working with pesticides, and you must follow all label instructions.
 This listing is not a recommendation or substitute for label instructions.
 If you would like more information about a product, you can contact the supplier via the information in the box below.
 They will provide you with additional information, including labels, and help you locate a distributor near you.
 WHAT ABOUT LIQUIDS?
 Many turf managers use liquid combinations of fertilizers and pesticides.
 However, all of the products listed here are granular formulations.
 Why?
 Most manufacturers do not make pre-mixed liquid combinations because it's relatively simple for applicators to create such tank mixes on their own.
 This is a common practice of lawn-care operators, for example.
 Granular mixes, by contrast, are best left to chemical manufacturers, who can homogenize their products so that they spread uniformly.
 (Mixing two separate granular products on your own could cause non-uniform coverage because granules of various sizes and weights may travel different distances when thrown from a spreader.) spreader.)
 by Reeves Petroff, Pesticide Education Specialist, Montana State University University
 Applying a tank mix of pesticides, or a pesticide and a liquid fertilizer, can save time, labor, energy and equipment costs.
 Pesticide combinations usually alter plant absorption and translocation as well as metabolism and toxicity at the site of action of one or more of the mixed products.
 Not all changes are for the better.
 Negative effects can occur such as reduced pest control, increased damage to non-target plants (phytotoxicity and incompatibility problems between materials.
 There are basically four types of interactions that change the efficacy of pesticide combinations.
 1.
 Additive effects occur when mixing two pesticides provide the same response as the combined effects of each material when applied alone.
 The products neither hurt nor enhance each other.
 Such mixes save time, labor and equipment use.
 2.
 Synergistic responses are often confused with additive effects and occur when two pesticides provide a greater response than the added effects of each material when applied separately.
 Unlike additive effects, the chemicals in a synergistic combination are not neutral toward each other.
 Rather, they interact in some way that increases their effect and may increase control.
 With true synergism, you can often reduce pesticide application rates without sacrificing control.
 An example would be the addition of piperonyl butoxide with the pyrethrum insecticides.
 3.
 Antagonism.
 When two pesticides applied together produce less control than if you applied each material separately is called antagonism.
 In addition to reducing control, antagonistic responses also may increase phytotoxicity to plants.
 When the herbicides Assert� (imazamethabenz-methyl) and Banvel� (dicamba) are mixed together, they negatively affect each other�s performance.
 4.
 Enhancement is another type of interaction, but not between two pesticides.
 Enhancement occurs when a pesticide is mixed with an additive to provide a greater response than if you applied the pesticide alone.
 A common example of enhancement is mixing an adjuvant with a pesticide.
 Incompatibility; chemical and physical physical
 Two or more pesticides, or a pesticide and a fertilizer, are compatible if no adverse effects occur as a result of mixing them together.
 The deactivation of an active ingredient often occurs with chemical incompatibility.
 This is most affected by temperature, tank pH and length of time that you hold a spray mixture in the tank before use.
 Physical incompatibilities usually involve the inert ingredients of a formulation.
 The mixture may become unstable, forming crystals, flakes, or sludge that may clog spray equipment.
 For herbicides, incompatibility most often occurs when you mix an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) formulation with wettable powders (WP).
 Similarly, you should not mix EC insecticides with fungicides or herbicides.
 Liquid fertilizers can also cause compatibility problems, mainly due to their strong electrochemical nature.
 Be sure to read and heed all pesticide labels! labels!
 The possible effects of mixing incompatible chemicals are many and include:
 � Reduced effectiveness of one or both compounds.
 � Precipitate in the tank, clogging screens and nozzles in the sprayer.
 � Plant phytotoxicity, stunting or reducing seed germination.
 � Excessive residues.
 � Excessive runoff.
 Other Incompatibilities Incompatibilities
 It is necessary to time pesticide applications when the pest is at its most vulnerable stage of development.
 When using two or more chemicals to manage different pests, it is critical that the mixture be applied at the correct time in the life cycle of the pests.
 Timing is especially important when applying herbicides.
 If herbicides are applied to wilted or stressed plants, the efficacy may be less than expected and there is enhanced risk to the desirable plants.

 Tank Mixing Mixing
 A pesticide label may indicate if two products can be mixed together and provide guidance as to the proper order in which they need to be mixed.
 A pesticide can be tank mixed if the label does not prohibit its application with other products and the pesticides in the mix must be registered individually on the crop you are treating.
 In this case, the applicator assumes all responsibility for the application.
 Potential problems with tank mixing include the failure of the products to remain uniformly dispersed generally caused by improper mixing, inadequate agitation, or a lack of stable emulsifiers in some EC formulations.
 Some pesticides will not mix with liquid fertilizer even when a compatibility agent is added.
 When attempting pesticide combinations that are unfamiliar to you, use a jar test to check for incompatibility.
 In addition, test the combination on a few plants or a small area before larger-scale treatments.
 Wait at least 2 to 3 days for any problems to become apparent.
 Keep accurate records on compatible, safe combinations for future reference.
 Jar Test for Compatibility of Pesticide Mixtures Mixtures
 Always wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when pouring or mixing pesticides.
 Perform this test in a safe area away from food and sources of ignition.
 Pesticides used in this test should be put into the spray tank when completed and applied to a labeled site.
 Rinse all utensils and jars and pour the rinse water (rinsate) into the spray tank.
 Do not use utensils or jars for any other purpose after they have contacted pesticides.
 Step 1.
 Measure 1 pint of water into a clear quart jar.
 Use the same water (or other diluent) that you will use when making up the larger mixture.
 Step 2.
 Add ingredients in the following order.
 Stir each time a formulation has been added.
 � Compatibility agents and activators.
 Add 1 teaspoon for each pint per 100 gallons of final spray mixture.
 � Wettable Powders and Dry Flowables.
 Add 1 tablespoon for each pound per 100 gallons of final spray mixture.
 � Water soluble concentrates or solutions.
 Add 1 teaspoon for each pint per 100 gallons of final spray mixture.
 � Emulsifiable concentrates.
 Add 1 teaspoon for each pint per 100 gallons of final spray mixture.
 � Soluble powders.
 Add 1 teaspoon for each pint per 100 gallons of final spray mixture.
 � Remaining adjuvants and surfactants.
 Add 1 teaspoon for each pint per 100 gallons of final spray mixture.
 Step 3.
 After mixing, let the solution stand for 15 minutes.
 Stir well and observe the results.
 Feel the sides of the jar to determine if the mixture is giving off heat.
 If so, the mixture may be undergoing a chemical reaction and the pesticides should not be combined.
 Let the mixture stand for about 15 minutes and feel again for unusual heat.
 If scum forms on the surface, if the mixture clumps, or if any solids settle to the bottom (except for wettable powders), the mixture probably is not compatible.
 Finally, if no signs of incompatibility appear, test the mixture on a small area of the surface where it is to be applied.
 Tank Mixing Guidelines Guidelines
 � Read the label.
 This is your first step when considering tank-mixes.
 � Perform a jar test with any new mixes.
 � Test pH.
 Many incompatibilities result from excessively alkaline (sometimes acidic) pH in the tank.
 The addition of buffering adjuvants can help.
 � Make a test application to expose any phytotoxicity or antagonism before you make a large-scale application.
 If you overlap a few strips, this also can show you how much of a margin of safety you have.
 Wait a few days for symptoms to become visible.
 � Take care with fertilizers.
 If you add fertilizers, be aware that they can have substantial effects on the chemistry of a tank mix, especially pH.
 Read the pesticide label for any fertilizer restrictions.
 � Do not mix iron sulfate with phenoxy herbicides.
 Iron sulfate is incompatible with amine formulations of some phenoxy herbicides and can cause a precipitate to form, clogging spray equipment.
 � Mix no more than one soluble or emulsifiable chemical with any insoluble products such as wettable powders or flowables.
 � Avoid mixing strongly acid materials with strongly alkaline materials.
 � Apply sprays soon after mixing.
 Mixes that sit for several hours or longer are prone to degrade, especially if the pH is alkaline.
 Proper Mixing Procedures Procedures
 � Mixing Order.
 Pesticide labels usually provide directions for mixing different materials, often describing the sequence of mixing.
 Whenever a label provides such directions, you should follow them.
 In general, follow the W-A-L-E-S plan when adding herbicides to a tank mix.
 1.
 Wettable Powders (WP) then Flowables (F, DF) DF)
 2.
 Agitate then add adjuvants such as anti-foaming compounds, buffers buffers
 3.
 Liquid and Soluble products products
 4.
 Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) (EC)
 5.
 Surfactants Top of Page Page
 Prior to mixing you should fill your spray tank with half of the carrier you intend to use, usually water.
 Then start the sprayer and check to make sure that all valves and gauges work and that you have proper tank agitation.
 NOTE:
 Compatibility agents are adjuvants that reduce the risk of incompatibility in pesticide or pesticide/fertilizer combinations.
 If you use a compatibility agent, it should be the first thing you put in the tank.
 � Pre-mixing.
 Pre-mixing in a smaller, separate container or tank is necessary for many pesticide formulations.
 � Wettable powders (WP).
 Make a slurry in a separate container by adding small increments of water until it forms a gravy-like consistency.
 Slowly add this slurry to the tank with the spray tank agitator running.
 � Dry flowable (DF) and water-dispersing granules (WDG).
 Pre-mix with 1 part flowable to 1 part water (start with the water and add the flowable to it) and then pour the mix slowly into the tank.
 � Liquid flowables.
 Premix liquid flowables by adding 1 part liquid chemical to 2 parts water (or liquid fertilizer) before blending in the tank.
 Many labels for liquid-flowable products describe the proper mixing procedure.
 When manufacturing a fertilizer-pesticide, you may be required to register your product with Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), depending on the usage of this combination.
 In all instances, the pesticides used in the combination product must be:
 1.registered under the Pest Control Products Act for control of those pests for which the fertilizer-pesticide product is being recommended.
 2.acceptable for use with a fertilizer according to the Compendium of Fertilizer-Use Pesticides.
 If the manufacturer/blender is soliciting sales for a fertilizer-pesticide without an order from the purchaser (example; not a customer-formula) registration is required.
 This includes fertilizer-pesticides applied by lawn care companies.
 On the other hand, if the manufacturer/blender is selling on a customer formula basis (note:
 customer formula means a fertilizer prepared in accordance with a written formula which sets forth the name, amount and analysis of each ingredient, the fertilizer grade of the total mixture and the signature of the person for whose use for fertilizing purposes it has been prepared), Section 3.1(1) of the Fertilizers Regulations applies:
 Exemptions from Registration Registration
 3.1(1) "A customer-formula fertilizer containing a pesticide registered under the Pest Control Products Act for the purpose stated on the label is exempt from registration if a copy of the label and the name and address of the customer for whom it was prepared is kept by the manufacturer for not less than one year after the date the fertilizer was prepared".
 Customer Formula Fertilizer-Pesticide Labelling Labelling
 Although customer formula fertilizer-pesticides are exempt from registration, they are subject to labelling requirements under Section 16(4) of the Fertilizers Regulations which states the following:
 "Every package containing a customer-formula fertilizer that contains a pesticide or lesser plant nutrient with toxic properties shall have a label affixed to it on which shall be printed:
 1.the name and address of the manufacturer of the fertilizer; fertilizer;
 2.the cautions to be observed in using the fertilizer; fertilizer;
 3.the grade of the fertilizer in the total mixture; mixture;
 4.the guaranteed analysis prescribed in Section 15; 15;
 5.the name and amount of each active ingredient of any pesticide in the fertilizer expressed in percent; percent;
 6.the directions for use; use;
 7.the name and address of the person who is to use the fertilizer for fertilizing purposes; and and
 8.the weight of the fertilizer" fertilizer"
 The aforementioned labelling information must appear on the shipping bill or on a statement accompanying the shipment for fertilizer that is sold in bulk.
 Registered Fertilizer-Pesticides Labelling Labelling
 A fertilizer-pesticide product that is required to be registered must meet the requirements of the Fertilizers Act and Regulations and the Compendium of Fertilizer-Use Pesticides.
 The Compendium identifies acceptable fertilizer-pesticide combinations and provides guidelines as to the acceptable levels of active ingredients, approved uses and claims, cautionary/warning and first aid statements, and instructions for the bulk blending of fertilizer-pesticides.
 In addition, the labelling requirements under Section 16 of the Fertilizers Regulations include the following:
 1.the name and address of the manufacturer of the fertilizer or of the registrant; registrant;
 2.the brand of the fertilizer, if any; any;
 3.the name of the fertilizer; fertilizer;
 4.the registration number of the fertilizer; fertilizer;
 5.the guaranteed analysis; analysis;
 6.the directions for use; use;
 7.the cautionary statements; and and
 8.the weight of the fertilizer fertilizer
 For packaged fertilizer-pesticide products, a label must be affixed to every package in the shipment.
 For bulk shipments, the labelling information must appear on the shipping bill or on a statement accompanying the shipment.
 Products advertised as all-in-one treatments for turf may be acceptable for limited use by homeowners, but they can create difficulties for commercial landscape maintenance companies.
 Touted as modern-day magic bullets, these products are much like the snake oils of the last century that were claimed to cure all that ailed man or beast.
 Truth is, no one product can simultaneously be effectively used as a fertilizer, pesticide, fungicide, and insecticide.
 The best time to fertilize is not always the best time to apply pesticides.
 Proportions in these concoctions are set.
 For one of these combination products to work to maximum efficiency turf conditions would have to match the product's design.
 That's backward.
 Multipurpose products permit little flexibility of choice in what is used on the lawn.
 Homeowner use can be successful in certain limited situations but the one-size-fits-all "weed and feed" promise is simplistic and results are often hit and miss.
 Tough problems that face landscape maintenance contractors and turf managers need a more surgical approach.
 It makes little sense for them to apply a herbicide when it isn't needed simply because it happens to be in the fertilizer.
 Professionals rely on soil analysis and a carefully reasoned approach to each situation as the best way to solve the problem and avoid over spending.
 Consideration needs to be given to all factors.
 The answer may not lie in fertilizer or in pesticides.
 The problem could be salt buildup, under or over watering, poor drainage, disease, or a number of other problems.
 The answers should be based on a scientific soil analysis.

 �Weed �n feed� is a combination herbicide and fertilizer product which is designed to kill weeds and fertilize the grass in a single application.
 Marketed under many different brand names, these chemically-based herbicides are some of the most toxic substances which are still legal to buy.
 (In Canada, all weed �n feed pesticide and fertilizer combination products have recently been banned.) banned.)
 Each year Americans apply an estimated 27 million pounds of weed �n feed to parks, cemeteries, home lawns and anywhere else mown grass is found.
 A mix of three �phenoxy herbicides� called 2,4-D, dicamba and mecoprop typically blended together into weed killers and weed �n feed products, they kill broadleaf plants such as dandelions while sparing grass.
 The lure of convenience, and effective marketing, have made weed �n feed among the most frequently used lawn care products.
 Short-term effectiveness is gained at the expense of long-term lawn and soil health.
 The overpowered chemical fertilizers these products contain actually weaken turf�causing the kind of fast, weak, unnatural growth that�s susceptible to pests and disease.
 Giving up the weed �n feed does not mean you�ll have to live with a weed strewn lawn.
 Organic lawn care practices, combined with nontoxic pre-emergent herbicides, will restore your weed patch to a healthy lawn, over time.
 Here are six reasons to avoid using synthetic weed �n feed products on your lawn:
 1.
 Uneven, excessive application of herbicides.
 Granular �weed and feed� products are applied to the entire lawn, not merely to areas of weeds, which results in herbicides being applied where they are not needed.
 The mixture of fertilizer and herbicide is incompatible because one ingredient should be applied to the entire lawn, and one is intended for problem spots.
 In most lawns, broadleaf weeds like dandelions usually occupy less than five or 10 per cent of the area.
 Gary Fish, an environmental specialist at the Maine Board of Pesticide Control, who used to work with Chemlawn before it merged with Tru Green, believes the combined weed �n feed products, whether for pre-emergent fertilizer or for weeds, are unnecessary and harmful to the environment.
 Fish said weed �n feed products use 20 to 30 times more pesticide than is needed.
 When we give lawns more food than they need, the excess fertilizers end up in the water because plants simply can�t absorb as much as we think they want.
 2.
 Granular �weed �n feed� chemicals harm the environment.
 Quick-release fertilizers, commonly used in most weed �n feed products, apply a quick and heavy dose of nutrients to the lawn, and are more likely to wash off when watered or after it rains.
 Even if you don�t live near the water, pesticides from your yard could travel through storm drains untreated to the nearest stream or lake, or seep into the water table.
 Nitrogen and other plant nutrients create algae blooms that smother aquatic life forms in streams, ponds, rivers and even the ocean.
 In addition, a main ingredient in �weed and feed,� 2,4-D or 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, has recently been cited as a contributor to contaminating salmon habitat.
 Birds eat weed �n feed granules as grit.
 Studies have linked weed-and-feed and crane fly pesticides to massive bird deaths, and this has caused the removal of some of the most toxic ingredients from the market.
 3.
 Weed �n feed chemicals are easily tracked indoors.
 Granular weed �n feed products cling to shoes and children�s clothing if they have playing on the lawn, and are easily carried indoors where they persist in the home environment.
 Dust is carried by the wind to neighbor�s yards, where the particles can also tracked indoors.
 Studies show that children and pets who play on toxically treated lawns absorb pesticide residues into their bodies.
 In recent governmental studies, researchers found that all study participants had residual toxins in their blood, including pesticides.
 Children in similar studies show pesticide residue markers in their urine.
 4.
 There are health risks associated with synthetic herbicides.
 The weedkillers (phenoxy herbicides) used in weed �n feed products are persistent, bioaccumulative toxic substances linked to cancers and to reproductive, immunological and neurological problems.
 Some of the herbicides in chemical weed �n feeds�especially 2, 4-D�have been linked to increased rates of cancer in people and dogs.
 5.
 Long-term lawn health is compromised.
 Once you begin a program of using synthetic fertilizers, your lawn becomes dependent on these chemicals to ensure a healthy weed-free look year after year.
 However, over-fertilizing with synthetic chemicals disinfects or kills most of the beneficial fungi and organisms in soil.
 This makes it more difficult to build naturally healthy turf which contains beneficial organisms.
 6.
 There are safer, more effective alternatives.
 The good news is that you can have a beautiful, healthy lawn without using blanket applications of synthetic lawn care chemicals.
 Building a healthy, organic lawn is the best way to choke out weeds.
 Lawns that are maintained properly through regular care (i.e.
 feeding, aeration, watering, and mowing), should only need �spot treating� of limited problem areas.
 To learn about organic lawn care methods, see our page on Natural Lawn Care.
 Consumers should also realize that weed �n feed products may kill existing weeds, but do not prevent new weeds from growing.
 You can prevent new weeds from germinating by applying a pre-emergent herbicide during that first warm spell in spring and in the early fall.
 One of the best pre-emergents is corn gluten meal, a completely natural substance that also provides the benefits of fertilizing.
 Corn gluten meal is an organic alternative to weed �n feed.
 Another effective method of controlling dandelions is pulling them manually.
 This may seem to be too difficult, but newly designed dandelion forks, which have a curved plate welded to the shaft, are very easy to use for pulling even the most stubborn dandelions.
 If your lawn is modest in size, a small investment in a dandelion fork will yield good results.
 For the health of our families, neighbors and our environment, pesticide use should be a measure of last resort.

 The purpose of the Fisheries Act is to conserve and protect Canadas fisheries resources, including fish habitat.
 It applies to all Canadian fisheries waters, including ditches, channelized streams, creeks, rivers, marshes, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and marine offshore areas.
 It also applies to seasonally wetted fish habitat such as shorelines, stream banks, floodplains and intermittent tributaries and privately owned land.
 It is an offence to damage fish habitat or put harmful substances such as pesticides into water frequented by fish.
 This includes pesticide drift.

 Food & Drugs Act Act
 The Food and Drugs Act protects the health of consumers by preventing the sale of food that contains any harmful or poisonous substances.
 Under the authority of this legislation the government determines the maximum amount of pesticide residue that may safely be contained in our foods.
 This amount is called the maximum residue limit (MRL).
 The MRL is measured in parts per million and is based on the toxicity of the pesticide, its application rate and timing, exposure from other sources, and the crop to which it is being applied.
 MRL's are established as regulations under the Food and Drugs Act.
 Health Canada administers the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations.
 Pesticide label restrictions on the time between applying a pesticide and harvesting a crop or allowing livestock to graze a treated area are designed so that the level of pesticide will be below the MRL at time of harvest and or grazing.
 The producer (the farmer), the spray operator, and the food processor are responsible for making sure all the restrictions are followed.
 Crops or produce may be seized and the producer may face a fine or jail sentence if a crop has pesticide residues greater than the MRL.
 The Canadian Food Inspection Agency delivers all federal inspection services related to food, animal health, and plant protection.
 This includes checking agricultural products to make sure they do not contain pesticide residues above the MRL.

 The Pest Control Products Act Act
 Before a pesticide can be sold or used in Canada, it must be registered under the Pest Control Products Act (PCP Act) and Regulations.
 This legislation is designed to ensure the acceptability of the risks, merit, and value of pest control products used in Canada.
 It focuses on the protection of human health and the environment as well as product performance.
 Therefore, before a pesticide is registered, the manufacturer must submit data to prove that the product is safe and effective when used as directed on the label.
 The manufacturer may be required to submit scientific data on chemistry, toxicology, metabolism, residues, environmental impact and effectiveness of the product.
 The PMRA analyses and assesses the data submitted.
 They must be sure that the product does not pose an unacceptable risk to plants, animals or the public health.
 If the pesticide is registered in Canada, it receives a Pest Control Products number or PCP#.
 Pesticides used in Canada must have a PCP#.
 Gain a more in depth understanding of pesticide registration by visiting the Pest Management Regulatory Agency Web site.
 This legislation defines a pest as any injurious, noxious or troublesome insect, fungus, bacterial organism, virus, weed, rodent or other plant or animal pest and includes any injurious, noxious or troublesome organic function of a plant or animal.
 This legislation defines a pesticide as any product, device, organism, substance or thing that is manufactured, represented, sold or used as a means for directly or indirectly controlling, preventing, destroying, mitigating, attracting or repelling any pest and includes compounds that enhance or modify or intend to enhance or modify the physical or chemical characteristics of a control product it is added to.
 In other words, compounds used to manage pests must be registered with the PMRA.

 Ontario's cosmetic pesticides ban will take effect April 22, 2009.
 The requirements of the ban are detailed in Ontario Regulation 63/09 and the Pesticides Act, which was amended by the Cosmetic Pesticides Ban Act, 2008.
 The provincial ban supersedes local municipal pesticides bylaws to create one clear, transparent and understandable set of rules across the province.
 Pesticides cannot be used for cosmetic purposes on lawns, vegetable and ornamental gardens, patios, driveways, cemeteries, and in parks and school yards.
 There are no exceptions for pest infestations (insects, fungi or weeds) in these areas, as lower risk pesticides, biopesticides and alternatives to pesticides exist.
 More than 250 pesticide products are banned for sale and over 95 pesticide ingredients are banned for cosmetic uses.
 Exceptions Exceptions
 Public health or safety:
 Pesticides can be used to control plants that are poisonous to the touch, such as poison ivy; insects that bite, sting, are venomous or are disease carrying, like mosquitoes; and animals, insects or plants that may cause damage to a structure or infrastructure, such as termites.
 �Natural resources:
 There is an exception, with Ministry of Natural Resources approval, to control invasive species that may be detrimental to health, the environment or the economy, or to protect a native plant, animal or a rare ecosystem.
 �Golf courses are conditionally excepted from the ban provided they follow tough new rules.
 They must become accredited for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) by an approved accreditation body.
 IPM uses a variety of tools, including best practices, mechanical and biological methods, along with pesticides when necessary, to manage pest populations.
 Golf courses must prepare an annual report on how they minimized their pesticide use and make the report accessible to the public.
 Also, they must hold a public meeting annually to present the report.
 �Sports fields are allowed a short term exception from the ban to host national or international level sports competitions.
 Written approval for the exception must be granted by the Minister of the Environment.
 Once the event concludes, the use of pesticides must end.
 Areas such as lawns and gardens around the sports fields are not excepted from the ban.
 �Specialty turf:
 Pesticides can be used to maintain specialty turf used for lawn bowling, cricket, lawn tennis and croquet if certain conditions are met.
 Areas such as lawns and gardens around the specialty turf are not excepted from the ban.
 IPM and annual reporting conditions, similar to those imposed on golf courses, must be followed.
 �Trees:
 Since trees are so important to protecting our climate, licensed exterminators can use conventional pesticides with the written opinion of a tree care professional that states that the use of the pesticide is necessary to protect the health of the tree.
 Homeowners and licensed exterminators can also buy and use biopesticides and lower risk pesticides (e.g., Btk - a biopesticide sprayed over Ontario cities for Gypsy moth control) to care for trees without requiring an opinion from a tree care professional.
 �Agriculture:
 The use of pesticides is necessary for agriculture from an economic and operational perspective.
 Ontario farmers already have stringent rules on the use, handling, storage and application of pesticides, and these rules will continue.
 The exception does not apply to a farmer's household vegetable garden and lawn.
 �Forestry:
 The use of pesticides in forestry is essential to protect trees from pests, and to control competing vegetation.
 Ontario's forestry workers must follow stringent rules on the use, handling, storage and application of pesticides.
 The exception applies to a range of forestry activities including harvest and reforestation.
 �Public works:
 Under the health or safety exception, pesticides are allowed to be used to maintain safe conditions, and the security of and emergency access to public works.
 Public works include highways, railways, power works, gas works, water works and other utilities, transit/transportation corridors and the perimeter of nuclear facilities.
 The exception does not apply to the use of a pesticide on a portion of a highway to which pedestrians have access on a regular basis or where the public is invited to stop including picnic and rest areas.
 Notice Signs Signs
 Homeowners can apply biopesticides or lower risk pesticides to control weeds and other pests on lawns, gardens, driveways and other areas around the home.
 However, if licensed exterminators use a lower risk pesticide or biopesticide, the exterminator must post a green notice sign on the lawn.
 This sign makes it clear that the exterminator is not using an illegal pesticide and satisfies the public's right to know about the use of a pesticide.
 For example, if an exterminator treated a lawn with corn gluten meal to suppress weeds, he/she would need to post a green sign.
 Pesticide Storage and Fire Department Notification Notification
 The ministry has harmonized storage and fire department notification requirements for manufacturers with existing requirements for operators (including commercial lawn care companies) and vendors.These requirements ensure that local fire departments know where pesticides are stored to protect human health and the environment.
 Pesticide Classification Classification
 To support the cosmetic pesticides ban, a pesticide classification system consisting of eleven classes of pesticides has been established.
 �Class 1 are manufacturing concentrates used in the manufacture of a pesticide product.�Classes 2, 3 and 4 are commercial or restricted pesticides that can continue to be used by farmers and licensed exterminators for non-banned uses.
 If the pesticide contains a Class 9 pesticide, it may only be used for an exception to the ban (e.g., agriculture, forestry, golf courses).
 �Classes 5 and 6 pesticides can be used by homeowners and include biopesticides and lower risk pesticides allowed for cosmetic uses.
 �Class 7 includes dual-use pesticides (i.e.
 indoor/outdoor uses).
 Such pesticides will only be allowed to be used for non-cosmetic purposes.
 For example, they can be used indoors to kill pests or outdoors for public health or safety reasons, but cannot be used outdoors to kill weeds.
 Retailers must give information to notify purchasers that only certain uses of these pesticides are legal.
 In two years' time, consumers will also not have ready access to these products, and continue to receive notification about the legal uses.
 �Class 8 are banned domestic products.
 (e.g., pesticide-fertilizer combination products, weed and insect control products for lawns and gardens).
 �Class 9 lists ingredients in pesticide products.
 These ingredients are banned for cosmetic use.
 Commercial or restricted products containing these ingredients may still be used by farmers or licensed exterminators for exceptions under the ban.
 �Class 10 pesticides are ingredients in pesticide products.
 These are the only ingredients that may be used to control plants that are poisonous to the touch under the public health or safety exception.
 �Class 11 lists ingredients that are biopesticides or lower risk pesticides.
 Licensed exterminators that use Class 11 pesticides are required to post a green notice sign to provide public notice of the use of these pesticides.
 Influence of foliar application of pesticides on leaf extracts and phylloplane microflora of corn.
 The effect of foliar application of captan, dithane, carbaryl and atrataf on the quantity of total carbohydrates, total amino acids and total nitrogen leached from corn leaves and on the phylloplane counts of fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes was studied.
 Leaf extracts were analyzed for amino acids, carbohydrates and nitrogen and were correlated with microbial counts.
 Generally the microbial counts were less than the control in treated samples and a significant change in Gram-negative bacteria in all treatments was recorded.
 All treated leaf extracts showed less total amino acids and total nitrogen though they were rich in carbohydrates as compared with the control.
 Herbicides, also commonly known as weedkillers, are pesticides used to kill unwanted plants. Selective herbicides kill specific targets while leaving the desired crop relatively unharmed.
 Some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed and are often synthetic "imitations" of plant hormones.
 Herbicides used to clear waste ground, industrial sites, railways and railway embankments are non-selective and kill all plant material with which they come into contact.
 Smaller quantities are used in forestry, pasture systems, and management of areas set aside as wildlife habitat.
 Some plants produce natural herbicides, such as the genus Juglans (walnuts), or the tree of heaven; such action of natural herbicides, and other related chemical interactions, is called allelopathy.
 Herbicides are widely used in agriculture and in landscape turf management.
 In the U.S., they account for about 70% of all agricultural pesticide use. use.

  HistoryPrior to the widespread use of chemical herbicides, cultural controls, such as altering soil pH, salinity, or fertility levels, were used to control weeds.
 Mechanical control (including tillage) was also (and still is) used to control weeds.
 The first widely used herbicide was 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, often abbreviated 2,4-D.[2] It was first commercialized by the paint company Sherwin-Williams and saw use in the late 1940s.
 It is easy and inexpensive to manufacture, and kills many broadleaf plants while leaving grasses largely unaffected, although high doses of 2,4-D at crucial growth periods can harm grass crops such as maize or cereals.
 The low cost of 2,4-D has led to continued usage today and it remains one of the most commonly used herbicides in the world.
 Like other acid herbicides, current formulations utilize either an amine salt (often trimethylamine) or one of many esters of the parent compound.
 These are easier to handle than the acid.
 2,4-D exhibits relatively good selectivity, meaning, in this case, that it controls a wide number of broadleaf weeds while causing little to no injury to grass crops at normal use rates.
 An herbicide is termed selective if it affects only certain types of plants, and nonselective if it inhibits a very broad range of plant types.
 Other herbicides have been more recently developed that achieve higher levels of selectivity than 2,4-D.
 The 1950s saw the introduction of the triazine family of herbicides, which includes atrazine, which have current distinction of being the herbicide family of greatest concern regarding groundwater contamination.
 Atrazine does not break down readily (within a few weeks) after being applied to soils of above neutral pH.
 Under alkaline soil conditions atrazine may be carried into the soil profile as far as the water table by soil water following rainfall causing the aforementioned contamination.
 Atrazine is thus said to have carryover, a generally undesirable property for herbicides.
 Glyphosate, frequently sold under the brand name Roundup, was introduced in 1974 for non-selective weed control.
 It is now a major herbicide in selective weed control in growing crop plants due to the development of crop plants that are resistant to it.
 The pairing of the herbicide with the resistant seed contributed to the consolidation of the seed and chemistry industry in the late 1990s.
 Many modern chemical herbicides for agriculture are specifically formulated to decompose within a short period after application.
 This is desirable as it allows crops which may be affected by the herbicide to be grown on the land in future seasons.
 However, herbicides with low residual activity (i.e., that decompose quickly) often do not provide season-long weed control.
  Health and environmental effectsSee also:
 Environmental effects of pesticides and Health effects of pesticides pesticides
 Herbicides have widely variable toxicity.
 In addition to acute toxicity from high exposures there is concern of possible carcinogenicity[3] as well as other long-term problems such as contributing to Parkinson's disease.
 Some herbicides cause a range of health effects ranging from skin rashes to death.
 The pathway of attack can arise from intentional or unintentional direct consumption, improper application resulting in the herbicide coming into direct contact with people or wildlife, inhalation of aerial sprays, or food consumption prior to the labeled pre-harvest interval.
 Under extreme conditions, herbicides can also be transported via surface runoff to contaminate distant water sources.
 Most herbicides decompose rapidly in soils via soil microbial decomposition, hydrolysis, or photolysis.
 Phenoxy herbicides are often contaminated with dioxins such as TCDD; research suggested that such contamination results in a small rise in cancer risk after exposure to these herbicides.[4] Triazine exposure has been implicated in a likely relationship to increased risk of breast cancer, although a causal relationship remains unclear.[5] unclear.[5]
 Herbicide manufacturers have at times made false or misleading claims about the safety of their products.
 Chemical manufacturer Monsanto Company agreed to change its advertising after pressure from New York attorney general Dennis Vacco; Vacco complained about misleading claims that its spray-on glyphosate based herbicides, including Roundup, were safer than table salt and "practically non-toxic" to mammals, birds, and fish.[6] Roundup is toxic and has resulted in death after being ingested in quantities ranging from 85 to 200 mL, although it has also been ingested in quantities as large as 500 mL with only mild or moderate symptoms.[7] The manfucturer of Tordon 101 (Dow AgroSciences, owned by the Dow Chemical Company) has claimed that Tordon 101 has no effects on animals and insects,[8] in spite of evidence of strong carcinogenic activity of the active ingredient[9] Picloram in studies on rats.[10] rats.[10]
 The risk of Parkinson's disease has been shown to increase with occupational exposure to herbicides and pesticides.[11] The herbicide paraquat is suspected to be one environmental factor causing Parkinson's disease.[12] disease.[12]
 All commercially-sold, organic and non-organic herbicides must be extensively tested prior to approval for sale and labeling by the Environmental Protection Agency.
 However, because of the large number of herbicides in use, there is significant concern regarding health effects.
 In addition to health effects caused by herbicides themselves, commercial herbicide mixtures often contain other chemicals, including inactive ingredients, which have negative impacts on human health.
 For example, Roundup contains adjuvants which, even in low concentrations, were found to kill human embryonic, placental, and umbilical cells in vitro.
[13] One study also found that Roundup caused genetic damage, but found that the damage was not caused by the active ingredient.[14] ingredient.[14]
  Ecological effectsCommercial herbicide use generally has negative impacts on bird populations, although the impacts are highly variable and often require field studies to predict accurately.
 Laboratory studies have at times overestimated negative impacts on birds due to toxicity, predicting serious problems that were not observed in the field.
[15] Most observed effects are due not to toxicity but to habitat changes and the decrease in abundance of species birds rely on for food or shelter.
 Herbicide use in silviculture, used to favor certain types of growth following clearcutting, can cause significant drops in bird populations.
 Even when herbicides are used which have low toxicity to birds, the herbicides decrease the abundance of many types of vegetation which the birds rely on.
[16] Herbicide use in agriculture in Britain has been linked to a decline in seed-eating bird species which rely on the weeds killed by the herbicides.
[17] Heavy use of herbicides in neotropical agricultural areas has been one of many factors implicated in limiting the usefulness of such agricultural land for wintering migratory birds.[18] birds.[18]
  Scientific uncertaintyThe health and environmental effects of many herbicides is unknown, and even within the scientific community there is often disagreement on the risk.
 For example, a 1995 panel of 13 scientists reviewing studies on the carcinogenicity of 2,4-D had divided opinions on the likelihood that 2,4-D causes cancer in humans.
[19] As of 1992[update], there were too few studies on phenoxy herbicides to accurately assess the risk of many types of cancer from these herbicides, even though evidence was stronger that exposure to these herbicides is associated with increased risk of soft tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
  ResistanceScientists generally agree that selection pressure applied to weed populations for a long enough period of time eventually leads to resistance.
 Plants have developed resistance to Atrazine and to ALS-inhibitors, and more recently, to glyphosate herbicides.
 Marestail is one weed that has developed glyphosate resistance.[20] resistance.[20]

 Herbicides can be grouped by activity, use, chemical family, mode of action, or type of vegetation controlled.
 By activity:
 Contact herbicides destroy only the plant tissue in contact with the chemical.
 Generally, these are the fastest acting herbicides.
 They are less effective on perennial plants, which are able to regrow from rhizomes, roots or tubers.
 Systemic herbicides are translocated through the plant, either from foliar application down to the roots, or from soil application up to the leaves.
 They are capable of controlling perennial plants and may be slower acting but ultimately more effective than contact herbicides.
 By use:
 Soil-applied herbicides are applied to the soil and are taken up by the roots and/or hypocotyl of the target plant.
 There are three main types of soil-applied herbicides:
 1.Pre-plant incorporated herbicides are soil applied prior to planting and mechanically incorporated into the soil.
 The objective for incorporation is to prevent dissipation through photodecomposition and/or volatility.
 2.Preemergent herbicides are applied to the soil before the crop emerges and prevent germination or early growth of weed seeds.
 3.Post-emergent herbicides are applied after the crop has emerged.
 Their classification by mechanism of action (MOA) indicates the first enzyme, protein, or biochemical step affected in the plant following application.
 The main mechanisms of action are:
 ACCase inhibitors are compounds that kill grasses.
 Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) is part of the first step of lipid synthesis.
 Thus, ACCase inhibitors affect cell membrane production in the meristems of the grass plant.
 The ACCases of grasses are sensitive to these herbicides, whereas the ACCases of dicot plants are not.
 ALS inhibitors:
 the acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzyme (also known as acetohydroxyacid synthase, or AHAS) is the first step in the synthesis of the branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine, and isoleucine).
 These herbicides slowly starve affected plants of these amino acids which eventually leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis.
 They affect grasses and dicots alike.
 The ALS inhibitor family includes sulfonylureas (SUs), imidazolinones (IMIs), triazolopyrimidines (TPs), pyrimidinyl oxybenzoates (POBs), and sulfonylamino carbonyl triazolinones (SCTs).
 ALS is a biological pathway that exists only in plants and not in animals thus making the ALS-inhibitors among the safest herbicides.
 EPSPS inhibitors:
 The enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase enzyme EPSPS is used in the synthesis of the amino acids tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine.
 They affect grasses and dicots alike.
 Glyphosate (Roundup) is a systemic EPSPS inhibitor but inactivated by soil contact.
 Synthetic auxin inaugurated the era of organic herbicides.
 They were discovered in the 1940s after a long study of the plant growth regulator auxin.
 Synthetic auxins mimic this plant hormone.
 They have several points of action on the cell membrane, and are effective in the control of dicot plants.
 2,4-D is a synthetic auxin herbicide.
 Photosystem II inhibitors reduce electron flow from water to NADPH2+ at the photochemical step in photosynthesis.
 They bind to the Qb site on the D1 protein, and prevent quinone from binding to this site.
 Therefore, this group of compounds cause electrons to accumulate on chlorophyll molecules.
 As a consequence, oxidation reactions in excess of those normally tolerated by the cell occur, and the plant dies.
 The triazine herbicides (including atrazine) and urea derivatives (diuron) are photosystem II inhibitors.[21] inhibitors.[21]
 Photosystem I inhibitors steal electrons from the normal pathway through FeS - Fdx - NADP leading to direct discharge of electrons on Oxygen.
 As result ROS (reactive oxygen species) are produced and oxidation reactions in excess of those normally tolerated by the cell occur leading to plant death.
 Bipyridinium herbicides (such as diquat and paraquat) hit "Fe-S - Fdx step" while diphenyl ether herbicide (such as nitrofen, nitrofluorfen, and acifluorfen) hit "Fdx - NADP step".
  Organic herbicidesRecently the term organic has come to imply products used in organic farming.
 Under this definition an organic herbicide is one that can be used in a farming enterprise that has been classified as organic.
 Commercially-sold organic herbicides are expensive and may not be affordable for commercial farming.
 Depending on the application, they may be less effective than synthetic herbicides and are generally used along with cultural and mechanical weed control practices.
 Homemade organic herbicides include:
 Corn gluten meal (CGM) is a natural preemergence weed control used in turfgrass, which reduces germination of many broadleaf and grass weeds.[22] weeds.[22]
 Spices are now effectively used in herbicides.
 Vinegar[23] is effective for 5-20% solutions of acetic acid with higher concentrations most effective but mainly destroys surface growth and so respraying to treat regrowth is needed.
 Resistant plants generally succumb when weakened by respraying.
 Steam has been applied commercially but is now considered uneconomic and inadequate.[24][25][26] It kills surface growth but not underground growth and so respraying to treat regrowth of perennials is needed.
 Flame is considered more effective than steam but suffers from the same difficulties.[27] difficulties.[27]
 D-limonene (citrus oil).
 D-limonene (citrus oil) is a natural degreasing agent that strips the waxy skin or cuticle from weeds, causing dehydration and ultimately death.
 Saltwater or salt applied in appropriate strengths to the rootzone will kill most plants.
 Monocerin produced by certain fungi will kill certain weeds such as Johnson Grass.
  ApplicationMost herbicides are applied as water-based sprays using ground equipment.
 Ground equipment varies in design, but large areas can be sprayed using self-propelled sprayers equipped with a long boom, of 60 to 80 feet (18 to 24 m) with flat fan nozzles spaced about every 20 inches (510 mm).
 Towed, handheld, and even horse-drawn sprayers are also used.
 Synthetic organic herbicides can generally be applied aerially using helicopters or airplanes, and can be applied through irrigation systems (chemigation).
 A new method of herbicide application involves ridding the soil of its active weed seed bank rather than just killing the weed.
 Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service have found that applying herbicides to fields late in the weed�s growing season greatly reduces its seed production, and therefore fewer weeds will return the following season.
 If herbicides are applied at the correct stage in the weed�s growing season, then the weed�s presence in the soil seed bank will greatly be reduced.
 Because most weeds are annual grasses, their seeds will only survive in soil for a year or two, so this method will be able to �weed out� the weed with only a few years of herbicide application.[28] application.[28]
 Weed-wiping may also be used, where a wick wetted with herbicide is suspended from a boom and dragged or rolled across the tops of the taller plants.
 This allows treatment of taller grassland weeds by direct contact without affecting related but desirable plants in the grassland sward beneath.
  TerminologyControl is the destruction of unwanted weeds, or the damage of them to the point where they are no longer competitive with the crop.
 Suppression is incomplete control still providing some economic benefit, such as reduced competition with the crop.
 Crop Safety, for selective herbicides, is the relative absence of damage or stress to the crop.
 Most selective herbicides cause some visible stress to crop plants.

 (August 2011) 2011)
 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) was a widely used broadleaf herbicide until being phased out starting in the late 1970s.
 While 2,4,5-T itself is of only moderate toxicity, the manufacturing process for 2,4,5-T contaminates this chemical with trace amounts of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).
 TCDD is extremely toxic to humans.
 With proper temperature control during production of 2,4,5-T, TCDD levels can be held to about .005 ppm.
 Before the TCDD risk was well understood, early production facilities lacked proper temperature controls.
 Individual batches tested later were found to have as much as 60 ppm of TCDD.
 2,4,5-T was withdrawn from use in the USA in 1983, at a time of heightened public sensitivity about chemical hazards in the environment.
 Public concern about dioxins was high, and production and use of other (non-herbicide) chemicals potentially containing TCDD contamination was also withdrawn.
 These included pentachlorophenol (a wood preservative) and PCBs (mainly used as stabilizing agents in transformer oil).
 Some feel[who?] that the 2,4,5-T withdrawal was not based on sound science.
 2,4,5-T has since largely been replaced by dicamba and triclopyr.
 Agent Orange was an herbicide blend used by the U.S.
 military in Vietnam between January 1965 and April 1970 as a defoliant.
 It was a 50/50 mixture of the n-butyl esters of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D.
 Because of TCDD contamination in the 2,4,5-T component, it has been blamed for serious illnesses in many veterans and Vietnamese people who were exposed to it.
 However, research on populations exposed to its dioxin contaminant have been inconsistent and inconclusive.
 Agent Orange often had much higher levels of TCDD than 2,4,5-T used in the US.
 The name Agent Orange is derived from the orange color-coded stripe used by the Army on barrels containing the product.
 It is worth noting[opinion] that there were other blends of synthetic auxins at the time of the Vietnam War whose containers were recognized by their colors, such as Agent Purple and Agent Pink Pink
 Abstract:
 In performing risk assessments for plant protection products by applicants or regulators in relation to the registration of the products, an important aspect to take into account is the foliar interception and retention of the active substance of the product on the plant.
 An overview is given of the approaches to this item in several parts of the world.
 The relevant circumstances and influencing variables, such as growth phase, planting density, and some physicochemical characteristics (e.g., vapor pressure and Henry�s coefficient) are dealt with.
 Finally, a proposal is presented for how to take into account the phenomenon of foliar interception and retention in the initial phase, first tier, of the risk assessment process.
 1.
 INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION
 In the registration process of plant protection products, governmental authorities as well as industrial applicants have to carry out risk assessments to come to decisions on the marketing of products.
 Several methods are available to perform these risk assessments.
 Sometimes the risk assessment is carried out on a case-by-case basis, and specific characteristics of the active substance are taken into account, depending on the situation.
 Generally, guidance documents are used to assist in the assessment procedure, for example, the European Union registration of plant protection products under 91/414/EEC and accompanying annexes .
 The purpose of the current paper is to describe the methods used for estimating foliar interception and retention and to develop new estimation rules for an appropriate environmental exposure analysis.
 Especially for the initial stage of the risk assessment (tier 1) it is necessary to know approximate foliar interception values (fraction of spray contacting the foliage) and retention values (fraction of spray retained by the foliage) of the plant for spray combinations of concern.
 These quantities are fundamental to understanding efficacy, environmental fate, water pollution potential, and nontarget effects of all pesticides applied to foliage of crops and weeds.
 The literature on the interception of pesticides by plants mainly deals with agronomic aspects of pesticide use, for example, whether spray equipment and weed control can be improved, or whether such data can be used for making or validating simulation models on crop growth.
 Therefore, most literature does not aim at determining the fractions of the application rate that are intercepted by the crop�leaves, stems or ears�in relation to the fractions that finally reach the soil [2�4].
 However, interception fractions are important input parameters for decision-making schemes that assess the potential or actual environmental risks following the deposition of pesticides on the soils of agroecosystems.
 Such risks may refer to the leaching to groundwater and the damage to indigenous populations of terrestrial micro- or macro-organisms.
 An overview of the interception fractions in use for environmental risk assessment in several countries is included in this article.
 Subsequently, interception data from field studies�and to a much lesser extent from greenhouse studies, as these do not necessarily reflect typical agricultural practices�will be reviewed.
 Proposals for standard crop- and growth phase-specific interception fractions will be discussed in relation to these field data.
 The present study focuses on crop interception rather than on soil deposition assuming that there are more data on the former than on the latter.
 Subsequently, the extent of soil deposition can be estimated by subtracting the extent of crop interception�and losses via other dissipation routes, if relevant from the application rate.
 However, actual experimental data on soil deposition should always be used for verification.
 Actual experimental field data on the interception of pesticides by crops are scarce [2] and [4], and therefore a comprehensive overview of the typical interception fractions for the various crops in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries cannot be presented.
 Besides, various agronomic (e.g., the type of crop cultivar, plant density and type of spray equipment), edaphic and (micro)climatological aspects may differ in such a way that comparisons between these experiments are difficult to make.
 The starting point in the present study is the literature on field experiments from which the interception fraction can be derived, directly or indirectly.
 The advantage of field trials is that they generally approach the typical agricultural practices by farmers the most closely.
 Greenhouse experiments on pesticide interception often differ from field experiments in their agronomic set-up, as they generally focus on plant- rather than crop-specific processes.
 On the other hand, greenhouse experiments generally show better material balances, as the occurrence of confounding variables (e.g., edaphic and (micro)climatological conditions) is more limited.
 Therefore greenhouse experiments are assumed to be less useful for indicating the range of interception fractions under field conditions, though they can be used to substantiate particular trends.
 In conclusion, the simple starting point has been adopted in the present study that the interception fraction plus the soil deposition fraction is unity (Fint + Fsoil = 1), unless other routes (e.g., via the air) are clearly indicated.
 A list of acronyms and abbreviations used is given in Section 9.

 CURRENT RISK ASSESSMENT APPROXIMATIONS APPROXIMATIONS
 2.1 Northern and Central Europe Europe
 2.1.1 Arable crops crops
 The Dutch decision-support system USES 2.0 characterizes environmental risks�with respect to, among others, groundwater leaching and hazards to terrestrial populations of agroecosystems�by taking standard crop-specific interception fractions into account (see Table 1) [5].
 These fractions are a rough summary of the crop-specific fractions as assessed by a committee of Dutch experts evaluating the Multi-Year Crop Protection Plan [6].
 This committee assessed the cropspecific soil deposition fractions (Fsoil) as the starting point, rather than simultaneously assessing the crop interception, the soil deposition, and the emission to the air.
 The committee also specified the period of the year rather than a particular growth phase.
 The German proposals for interception fractions have been published by Becker et al.
 [4].
 See for additional information on the growth phases in Section 4.2.1.2 Flower bulbs bulbs
 There are no specific standard interception fractions in the Netherlands for the environmental risk assessment following pesticide use for bulb cultivation, nor have they been found in the literature assessed.
 2.1.3 Orchards Orchards
 In Table 2, the standard interception factors are given as used for fruit trees in The Netherlands.
 2.1.4 Other crops crops
 In Table 3, the standard interception factors are given as used for grassland in The Netherlands.
 For pesticide registration purposes, in the Netherlands 0.1 and 0.8 are used as general default interception and soil deposition fractions, respectively, in case no standard fractions are available, or in case it is not clear on which growth phase of the crop, the pesticide is intended to be used.
 This option reflects a worst-case scenario.
 2.2 United States of America America
 In the United States, the U.S.
 EPA Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) uses data on application of pesticides to the foliage of both target crops and other nontarget plants and on dissipation of the chemical from that foliage in ecological and in human health risk assessments carried out for registration and reregistration of pesticide under the Federal Insecticide Fungicide Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA).
 These assessments are primarily carried out by two divisions within OPP:
 the Environmental Fate and Effects Division (EFED) and the Health Effects Division (HED).
 The Environmental Fate and Effects Division calculates pesticide estimated environmental concentrations (EECs) in surface water and in potential avian and mammalian food items for ecological risk assessments under FIFRA.
 The estimated concentrations are compared to toxicological measurements to assess potential risk.
 EFED also estimates concentrations in surface and ground water for human health risk assessments under FQPA.
 These exposure assessments are primarily carried out using the PRZM and EXAMS computer models and simpler screening models.
 Foliar application, wash-off, and degradation are an important component of this modeling.
 The Health Effects Division (HED) estimates risk to human health and life both to agricultural workers through direct exposure on the job as well as to the population at large through ingestion of agricultural products on which pesticide residues may remain.
 Foliar application and residues are of interest in both types of assessments.
 Rates of dissipation of pesticide on foliage are of direct interest in establishing re-entry periods for workers after a field application.
 These tests and the re-entry periods set are needed to reduce worker exposure to a minimum.
 Foliar dissipation rates are also important in understanding residues on foliar crops such as spinach and the lettuces.
 The Pesticide Root Zone Model (PRZM3), now in version 3.12, has the capability to simulate pesticide application to crop foliage as well as volatilization from the foliage, degradation on the foliage, and wash-off from the foliage.
 Pesticide, which is washed off the foliage, is treated by the program as a new application to the soil.
 The program assumes that the fraction of an application that is deposited directly on the foliage is the same as the fraction of the soil, which has foliage directly above it on the application day.
 The remainder is deposited directly to the soil.
 The program also assumes that the crop foliage increases in aerial extent from zero on the date of crop emergence (EMD) to a maximum (COVMAX) on the date of crop maturity (MAD).
 For most crops, this maximum coverage will be in the order of 80 to 100%.
 See Table 6 for recommended values.
 The increase in foliar cover may be linear or nonlinear (exponential).
 In addition to the modeling approach presented above, an empirical approach for the estimation of maximum pesticide residue levels resulting from initial interception by various plant components has been used in the United States for some time.
 The basis for this approach was an industry need in the early 1970s for exposure estimates to support initial toxicological assessments of pesticides for nontarget terrestrial organisms (e.g., birds, wild mammals).
 By use of foliar pesticide data from 22 published field studies (21 pesticides), which represented more than 250 different pesticide�crop combinations, a correlation analysis of pesticide application rate vs.
 initial concentration for seven plant categories was developed by Eugene Kenaga of the Dow Chemical Agricultural Products Department [9].
 Both �upper limit� values, which encompassed greater than 95% of reported values, and �typical limit� values, which represented the means of reported values, were developed (Table 7).
 During the early 1980s, the need for regulatory assessments of pesticide exposure led the U.S.
 Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to transform this analysis into an easily used nomogram to be used as part of the standard operating procedures for risk assessment [10].
 Use of the so-called Kenaga nomogram allows estimation of pesticide concentrations in plant foliage based on plant type and application rate, and its international applicability was previously reviewed by IUPAC [11].
 Because the Kenaga nomogram was based on data developed during the 1960s and early 1970s, during which time some older pesticide products were used which have been subsequently replaced (e.g., DDT, aldrin, endrin), a reassessment of its accuracy has been recently completed [12].
 Results of this analysis of field residue data from 249 published papers representing 121 different pesticides and 118 different plant species largely confirmed the accuracy and conservative nature of the earlier estimations (Table 7).
 Only the maximum estimates for forage crops and fruits were found to be exceeded with enough frequency, 22% and 19%, respectively, so as to merit upward adjustment for a worst-case assessment.
 Strengths of the Kenaga nomogram approach include its ease of use, long-term use and widespread acceptance, provision of foliar interception values in units of mg/kg, and inclusion of both crop and non-crop plants.
 Its main utility has been in support of worst-case, early-tier assessments of terrestrial nontarget organism dietary intake.
 The conservative nature of the estimates it yields stems in part from the fact that mechanisms by which pesticide residues decrease in plants (e.g., growth dilution, degradation, volatility, wash-off) are not considered.
 In addition to these factors, both crop- and pesticide- specific parameters would be required for more refined assessments.
 Employment of this more highly refined approach for specific chemicals and crops has highlighted the highly conservative nature of the estimates provided by the Kenaga nomogram [13].
 At present, the USEPA and industry are involved in the collaborative Ecological Committee on FIFRA Risk Assessment Methods (ECOFRAM) effort, which is target ed at developing more highly refined, probabilistic approaches to terrestrial nontarget organism risk assessment [14].
 This work will include proposals for more advanced methods of estimation and measurement of nontarget organism risk, including that of foliar deposition rates of pesticides.

 FIELD EXPERIMENTS EXPERIMENTS
 3.1 Northern and Central Europe Europe
 Field experiments are considered useful for indicating the range of interception fractions if they comply with the following requirements:
 (1) the cultivation system is comparable with current agronomic practice, (2) the growth phase of the crop is clearly reported, (3) the methodology is valid, and (4) the reporting is adequate.
 Aerial applications are not included for reasons of convenience.
 In general, interception fractions are expected to be lower for aerial applications than for applications from the ground [15].
 A part of these interception data is based on the soil cover (i.e., the vertical projection of the crop on the soil) of various crops on control plots in numerous field trials in Northern and Central Europe [4].
 These soil covers were pragmatically corrected for weed cover by calculating the mean of the soil cover for a particular growth phase plus one time the standard deviation, instead of the mean � the standard deviation.
 This correction was confirmed by some actual field data.
 Therefore this approach seems to be promising.
 Another part of the data in this section is directly derived from field trials in which the interception of pesticides has been measured by tracer or pesticide residue analysis of the crops.
 A third part of the data is indirectly derived from field trials in which the pesticide fraction that finally reaches the soil has been measured.
 As we are actually interested in the latter, we may subtract these fractions from 1 to obtain an estimated fraction, which is based on a real Fsoil.
 The field interception data in this chapter are lumped by crop-specific growth phase, irrespective of particular experimental conditions such as the meteorology, the type of sprayer, and the active ingredient.
 The underlying assumption is that the amount of leaves that cover the ground is primarily decisive for the actual interception fraction.
 This is also assumed by Jagers op Akkerhuis [3].
 Various field data are included to indicate these experimental ranges of interception fractions by growth phase.
 It should be noted that crop interception is probably not linearly correlated with the soil cover by the crop in general, but with the plant biomass, as was demonstrated by Wauchope and Street [16] for rice.
 Therefore, linear interpolation of interception fractions in view of different soil covers is not reliable, but may be used as a best guess, if necessary.
 Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the experimental ranges of interception fractions from field data respecting potatoes, sugar beets, and cereals, respectively.
 It is clear that these ranges�as they reflect different experimental conditions�may be large, especially for those growth phases in which the leaves are developing.
 However, these ranges appear to be larger for potatoes than for sugar beets and cereals, whereas for the latter, the later growth phases�stem elongation, senescence�have larger ranges.
 Figure 3 shows that interception fraction estimates based on soil cover�corrected for the weed cover�may give less wider ranges, than when interception fractions are also based on other field data that actually assess the final pesticide depositions on soil (cf Fig.
 4).
 These additional data from the field trials with cereals [8] include much lower interception fractions than those estimated by Becker et al.
 This may mean that the method of Becker et al.
 overestimates the actual interception fractions of cereals.
 However, the data of Becker et al.
 are more consistent, whereas the data of Van de Zande et al.
 reflect more different experimental set-ups.
 Therefore, the estimates by Becker et al.
 are probably more suitable for comparing the major growth phases within one crop.
 7.
 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION DISCUSSION
 Proposals for standard growth phase-specific interception fractions per crop are presented in Table 10.
 Most of these proposals are based on interception fractions that have been indirectly derived from the control plots of numerous efficacy field trials of BASF with herbicides for Northern and Central European crops.
 Therefore, most underlying data are based on the soil cover of a particular growth phase, and not on actual measurements of crop interception or soil deposition.
 It should be noted, however, that there has been a pragmatic correction for the weed cover in these control plots.
 Arguments in favour of this relatively simple approach of Becker et al.
 [4] are:
 � the rapid acquirement of interception fractions, that otherwise would have to be obtained by technically complicated, elaborate, and expensive experiments; experiments;
 � the estimates reflect the phenological development of a crop in time by taking all major growth phases into account; and and
 � there is a reasonable agreement between this approach and at least some of the few studies in which actual interception measurements have been performed (but not for all, see ref.
 3).
 On the other hand, the approach by Becker et al.
 inherently is an oversimplification of the complex processes that ultimately result in the actual crop interception and soil deposition of pesticides (cf Nordbo et al.
 [27] and Jagers op Akkerhuis et al.
 [3]).
 Important details of these processes are only recently under investigation, as was shown by Wauchope et al.
 [2] and Jagers op Akkerhuis et al.
 [3].
 Model simulation (e.g., for cereals) has to be based on the intercepting surfaces of both leaves, stems, and ears, as all these parts contribute significantly to the interception fraction [3].
 However, many relevant input parameters for such sophisticated simulation models will not always be available:
 for example, crop-stratified measurements on the number and mean area of stems, leaves, and ears.
 The results of more complicated modeling can be different from the results of the German approach, again indicating the relativity of the latter.
 Jagers op Akkerhuis et al.
 [3] found Fsoil values for two growth phases of spring barley of 0.3 and 0.2 (both phases within the major growth phase of booting up to senescence, cf Figs.
 3 and 4), whereas the Fsoil according to the approach of Becker et al.
 is 1�0.9 = 0.1.
 The German approach in this particular case apparently underestimates the �actual� soil deposition, however, differences in crop density, fertilization, and varietal appearance could also be explanations aswell.
 The standardization of crop-specific interception fractions will be of great help for the environmental risk assessment of the soil and its inhabitants, especially at the first tier.
 However, in view of the preceding, it is tedious to derive such standardized values from analytical experiments for various reasons.
 First, there are not many experimental data available on this issue that are useful.
 Secondly, if experimental data are available, they are generally difficult to compare, as they differ in their experimental set-up and the edaphic and climatological factors.
 As an alternative, the approach by Becker et al.
 seems promising, although both over- and underestimation of the interception fraction may occur, as is demonstrated in the preceding text.
 This may have consequences for the type of risk assessment (e.g., whether to assess the risks in accordance with a worst-case scenario).
 Also, the �validation� of the interception fractions�as estimated by Becker et al.�by experimental measurements on the actual interception remains necessary, especially in view of the lack of useful experimental data on this issue in general.
 The approach of Becker et al.
 fits with a proposal of the Danish EPA for estimating interception fractions [24].
 This proposal was based on the extent of light interception by the different growth phases of crops by assuming:
 Fsoil = [100] minus [95% of the soil cover by the crop].
 Comparison of some of the field trials with actual measurements of Fint or Fsoil shows for sugar beets, onions, and lilies that this Danish approach may both over- or underestimate the actual Fsoil or Fint.
 The experimental field data on which the proposals for standard interception fractions have been based are mainly from Northern and Central European crops.
 Data on, for instance, Mediterranean or subtropical crops are almost lacking.
 However, to some extent, some of such crops could possibly be compared with Northern or Central European crops, assuming that the interception data are based on comparable physical processes and comparable agronomic conditions (e.g., type of cultivation including plant densities).
 It is an additional advantage that the approach of Becker et al.
 assumes an indirect relation between the soil cover of the crop and the interception fraction:
 the interception fraction is the mean soil coverage fraction plus one time the standard deviation of the soil coverage fraction.
 The same Foliar interception and retention values after pesticide application approach could be applied for other crops.
 As an example:
 soybeans could be compared with (fodder) peas.
 However, as the leaf hairs of soybeans are the primary points of contact with the droplets, the contribution of bouncing droplets to the fraction that passes the vegetation (almost) immediately may be much larger than for the smooth, reflective surfaces of peas.
 In conclusion, it is recommended to extend the approach of Becker et al.
 to the crops outside Northern and Central Europe, knowing that data on soil cover by crops as determined in efficacy field trials may have been obtained already by agrochemical concerns.
 However, as there appears to be only few experimental data on the actual interception by these crops�as for the Northern and Central European crops�there remains a need for confirmation of these standard interception fractions by field trials.

 RECOMMENDATIONS RECOMMENDATIONS
 1.
 A prerequisite assumption in performing risk assessments for plant protection products is that the product will be applied in accordance with good agricultural practice.
 2.
 A few studies on foliar interception and retention are reported in the literature, and thus far, there has not been enough research to facilitate accurate estimates of spray interception for a large number of crops under the growing conditions in various parts of the world.
 The available literature seems therefore inadequate for a risk assessment in all cases.
 This is especially true with respect to field studies.
 However, some estimations have been reported which are based on expert judgement.
 It is recommended that available literature on foliar interception and retention as summarized here be used in the first tier of the risk assessment carried out for the registration of pesticides whenever reliable data exists.
 3.
 Where suggested estimates could lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding risk, additional (field) data should be generated to carry out more realistic or accurate risk assessments for the product under consideration.
 4.
 As the global distribution of the available data is rather limited, additional field data should be generated and for as many different crops as possible in different geographical areas.
 5.
 The number of different crops for which field studies have been carried out is still limited.
 When performing risk assessments for a crop not mentioned, the most appropriate values should be used from the table presented based on expert judgement.
 However, for some crops the data may not be suitable for a first tier estimate of the interception or retention to use in the risk assessment.
 In this case, additional data are required to be generated on the interception and retention phenomena.
 6.
 Surfactants used as adjuvants and other individual adjuvants may influence the interception and retention or rainfast properties of various pesticide sprays.
 The most appropriate correction should be used taking into account the effects of the surfactants based on expert judgement.
 Estimates of interception or retention should reflect the known effects of the specific adjuvants involved.
 7.
 As the application equipment may influence the interception and/or retention, then the risk assessment should be based on realistic estimates of the characteristics of the equipment being used in a particular crop.
 8.
 For higher tier risk assessments, it is necessary to obtain data from field studies to accurately characterize the foliar interception and/or the retention factors.
 Control using Herbicides Herbicides
 This web page provides an overview of the techniques that are commonly used to control invasive plants with herbicides.
 MACC recognizes many concerns regarding the application of herbicides, and discourages the use of herbicides unless they are deemed the only feasible option to achieve control.
 In situations where use of herbicides is the only feasible control method, MACC supports their use, provided such use is carefully planned, permitted, and monitored.
 Herbicide use and application methods are regulated by state and federal laws -- the pesticide label is the law.
 It is the responsibility of the landowner and any employees or contractors to adhere to state and federal pesticide laws at all times.
 Pesticide Licensing Licensing
 Chemical herbicides are a common method of controlling invasive plants.
 Herbicide use is carefully regulated by the state of Massachusetts and by Federal laws.
 In general, landowners can apply unrestricted herbicides on their own property outside of the wetland buffer zone; permits may be required within the buffer zone.
 A pesticide applicator�s license is required to apply restricted pesticides, or to apply any pesticide on land owned by another.

 Common Herbicide Application Methods Methods
 The method one uses to apply herbicide depends on such factors as target species, site characteristics, herbicide type, and time of year.
 Wetland approved herbicides are required near waterways in accordance with state and federal regulations.
 The most common herbicides used for invasive plant control are systemic herbicides, although other herbicide types are available and may be appropriate.
 Systemic herbicides kill the plant by being absorbed into, and translocated throughout the plant tissue.
 It is important to apply herbicides when the plant is translocating carbohydrates (sugars) down to the roots (from early summer to early winter).
 It is also important to apply enough herbicide to the aboveground parts of the plant to kill all the roots.
 With the cut-stump method, concentrated herbicide is applied to a small surface area on the top of the freshly cut stump.
 Conversely, with foliar spray, a low diluted herbicide is applied to a large surface area (all the leaves).
 Foliar spray will not kill the plant if it is applied only to a small percentage of leaves.
 Regardless of method, it is important not to cut stems or roots of target plants for at least 6 months to a year after the herbicide is applied.
 Herbicide takes months to work its way through the plant�s vascular system, and cutting may disrupt its flow to living tissue.
 Foliar Spray:
 Foliar application of herbicides entails spraying the leaves of target plants during the growing season with a low concentration of herbicide (approximately 0.75�3%) in water.
 Marking dyes, anti-drift formulations, and surfactants should be added in accordance with the pesticide label.
 The spray can be applied with a hand-powered, backpack sprayer or larger, motorized sprayers.
 Foliar spray treatments should be conducted during the growing season, between early July and mid-September.
 At all times, applicators should be aware of herbicide drift.
 Applicators should spray with their back to desirable vegetation, sensitive areas, and waterways, and avoid spraying during windy days.
 Lowering tank pressure and setting the nozzle opening wider (more stream than spray) will lessen the potential for drift.
 If spray contacts the foliage of desirable vegetation, immediately cut off the affected leaves or branches to minimize the absorption of herbicide.
 One should avoid spraying tall vegetation.
 In addition, the herbicide can take many months to travel from the leaves to the roots; therefore, it is important to wait at least a year before cutting the stems of woody vegetation treated with foliar spray.
 Cut-stump:
 The cut-stump method entails cutting vegetation near the ground and applying concentrated herbicide to the stump or stumps (in the case of multiple stemmed plants).
 Herbicides should be applied immediately after the cut is made and should cover the plant�s cambial tissue around the rim of the stem.
 Marking dye should be added to the herbicide to indicate which stems have been treated.
 Cuts often are made with hand saws or pruners, but chainsaws or gas-powered brush saws may be used on larger stems.
 Herbicide may be applied with paint brushes, squirt bottles, foam applicators, and mechanized applicators mounted on brush saws.
 The cut-stump method is time consuming, but it is very selective.
 It should be used near sensitive, desirable vegetation and on target plants that cannot be foliar sprayed without a high risk of drift (e.g., tall shrubs, trees, or vines).
 The cut-stump method can be used any time the plant is translocating sugars through the cambium down to the roots.
 The general period for this activity is from early July through November, although there is some evidence that fall application is more effective.
 Basal Spray:
 The basal-spray method involves the application of an oil-based herbicide to the bottom portion of a plant�s stem.
 The oil penetrates the plant�s bark and carries the herbicide into the cambium for translocation to the roots.
 Basal treatments generally are applied using a sprayer at low pressure with a marking dye.
 The concentration of herbicide in oil is dependent on the product being used and the application type.
 Consult pesticide labels for treatment methods, mixture instructions, and site restrictions.
 The basal-spray method is similar to cut-stump application in that it is highly selective and may be used from early July through December.
 It tends to be faster than cut-stump because cutting is not required, but may require the application of more active ingredient.
 Basal spray formulations can also be applied to cut-stumps that have begun to re-sprout.
 Aquatic Herbicide Applications:
 Herbicide use in aquatic environments is carefully regulated by the state.
 Applicants must meet the requirements of a BRP WM 04 license.
 For a description of the permit process please see page 8 of Guidance for Aquatic Plant Management in Lakes and Ponds as it Relates to the Wetlands Protection Act.
 For a thorough description of aquatic herbicide use please see Section 4.6 of Massachusetts DCR�s Generic Environmental Impact Report (GEIR) (GEIR)
 Reducing Non-Target Kill:
 It is important to avoid the unintentional killing of non-target plant species.
 Nevertheless, it should be expected that some non-target kill will occur.
 Application guidelines to reduce herbicide drift are outlined on the product label.
 Several tools are available that apply the herbicide in a targeted manner.
 Reviews of select tools are available at this website.
 Use common sense and caution at all times.
 Invasive species may form root grafts with desirable native plants.
 While not common, herbicide applied to an invasive plant might be translocated through the roots and damage non-target vegetation.
 Foliar Application of Pesticides and Other Products Products
 The onion industry and growers rely upon the timely application of foliar products (pesticides, fertilizers, amendments) to maintain onion plant health and protection against production constraints including pests such as weeds, insects and diseases.
 A number of topics affect the effectiveness and value of these applications to various types of onions grown in different production systems.
 We would like to use this Posting as an opportunity to share experiences (good or bad) from our collective activities in production and research settings; and identify potential areas of future need, research, and collaboration that address priorities for the onion growers and industry.

 Applying Systemic Soil and Foliar Spray Insecticides to Control Florida Wax Scale* on Hollies Hollies
 Bastiaan M.
 Drees, Professor and Extension Entomologist Entomologist
 APPLYING A SYSTEMIC INSECTICIDE TO SOIL:
 1.
 Assemble proper equipment (product, applicator, protective clothing).
 Be sure protective clothing and application equipment are clean and in good repair from previous use before proceeding.
 Clean and store equipment and protective clothing properly after making an application.
 2.
 Properly mark designated equipment.
 If using a sprinkler can or other equipment for making pesticide application, write �Chemical Use Only� on the container.
 Do not use this equipment for other purposes.
 Do not use herbicides in application equipment used for insecticide or miticide treatments.
 3.
 Read the product label thoroughly.
 The label will specify what safety equipment is required such as gloves or goggles, long-sleeved shorts, pants and shoes.
 Review section to determine the application rate and concentration of material to be applied.
 Review any re-entry intervals, if any.
 4.
 Measure plant height.
 When using Bayer � Advanced� Tree & Shrub Insect Control containing imidacloprid, the use rate (gallons of dilute solution to drench around the root zone) varies with plant height.
 Prune the plant to eliminate heavily-infested leaves to reduce plant height and allow regrowth to be protected by the insecticide.
 5.
 Wear proper personal protection.
 Mixing concentrated insecticide from the container with water is possibly the most hazardous part of using a pesticide.
 Wear gloves and other clothing described on the product label before opening the container and mixing.
 6.
 Shake the container.
 Some pesticide formulations will settle and separate during long periods of storage.
 Allways, shake the container to agitate the contents before opening.
 7.
 Partially fill the applicator tank or container with water.
 This step will help the concentrate material go into solution and prevent concentrate insecticide from coating the sides of the applicator container.
 Adding more water later will help stir this solution.
 8.
 Add proper amount of insecticide product.
 The product label will provide the amount to mix with a volume of water.
 To control �soft scales� (including Florida wax scales) on holly shrubs, apply 3 fluid ounces per foot of height to the root zone or soil underneath the shrub.
 Use a designated measuring cup that is well marked to avoid misusage.
 9.
 Pour concentrate into application container and rinse measuring cup or spoon.
 Using water to fill the applicator, rinse the measuring cup or spoon three times to help remove concentrate insecticide and mix it into solution.
 10.
 Apply diluted solution to root zone.
 Sprinkle insecticide solution on soil underneath the canopy of the shrub.
 Systemic insecticides like imidacloprid are moved from the roots in the soil to the leaves.
 Do not apply to water saturated soils.
 The solution must penetrate into soil and stay in place for roots to pick up the active ingredient.
 TIMING:
 This application needs to occur several weeks before egg hatch of this soft scale species.
 In Texas, the Florida wax scale has two distinct generations, one in late-April and the second in late-August.
 Scales located on branches and twigs may be unaffected by systemic insecticides, so foliar treatments may also be required to eliminate an infestation.
 Monitor the occurrence of new young scales on leaves in late May and late September to determine treatment success.
 APPLYING A FOLIAR SPRAY:
 1.
 Carefully read the label directions on the container or labelling leaflet supplied with the container.
 Directions provide information about personal protective clothing, timing(s) for making application(s), and equipment required and rate of product to apply.
 Orthene� Tree, Turf and Ornamental Spray is a soluble powder formulation of the active ingredient, acephate (75% concentrate).
 2.
 Fill applicator container with some water.
 Make sure the applicator works.
 Seals in older compression sprayers can prevent pressure build up in the tank or the nozzel may be clogged.
 Also use this water to help agitate the concentrate insecticide so it can mix into a dilute solution.
 3.
 Measure out the proper amount of concentrate insecticide.
 For scale insect control Orthene� Tree, Turf and Ornamental spray is applied at a rate of 1 tsp per gallon.
 Use a designated measuring spoon (marked �poison�) while wearing proper application equipment.
 4.
 Fill applicator with remaining amount of water.
 In this demonstration, a small 2 pint compression sprayer is being used, requiring only 1/8 tsp.
 75% acephate.
 Adding water after adding the soluble powder helps agitate the solution to mix the insecticide to make a dilute solution.
 Use larger equipment for larger tasks.
 5.
 Wear goggles, gloves, long pants and long sleeved shirt.
 As directed on the product label, but particularly when using fine droplet sprays and needing to crawl through shrubbery, take all precautions to avoid getting dilute insecticide solution in eyes or on skin.
 6.
 Pump up sprayer.
 Use manufacturer�s recommendation to pressurize the sprayer tank.
 Agitate the insecticide solution again before spraying.
 Use up all the mixed spray solution.
 Do not leave unused solution in the sprayer because the insecticide will decompose and the liquid will corrode and ruin the applicator.
 7.
 Start spraying the most inaccessible areas first and back away from treated foliage areas.
 Avoid brushing up against just-sprayed foliage.
 Spray the undersides of the lowest leaves first.
 8.
 Treat upper leaf surfaces last.
 The Florida wax scale settles mainly on upper leaf surfaces.
 However, some egg-laying females can be found on branches, twigs and the underside of leaves.
 Thorough coverage is necessary to eliminate the whole population.
 Orthene� or acephate is a foliarly-applied contact and systemic insecticide that is absorbed into leaf tissues and is moved by the plant to new growth.
 Scales contacted by the spray will be killed, and the foliage containing acephate will kill young scales settling andbeginning to feed on the plant sap.
 Other foliar spray products, such as those containing malathion, insecticidal soap or horticultural oil, have no systemic activity and have little or no residual or long-lasting activity.
 These products must be re-applied so that all scales are contacted.
 TIMING:
 In Texas, the Florida wax scale eggs hatch primarily twice per year, although some eggs can hatch at any time.
 Egg hatch occurs over a period of several weeks during each generation (late April and late August).
 Foliar sprays are most effective when applied during the period when the crawler stages of this scale insect first settle on foliage to start feeding.
 The Orthene� label recommends applying this foliar spray at 2 week intervals through the egg hatch period.
 If using products with ingredients that do not provide a long period of control, such as insecticidal soap or horticultural oil, re-treatments may be required more frequently.
 Always monitor plants for signs of phytotoxicity from the spray, such as discoloration, browning or leaf drop.
 Monitor success of foliar sprays by looking for newly settled young scale insects developing on leaves after treatments.

 SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE USE OF HERBICIDES TO CONTROL INVASIVE PLANTS PLANTS
 The most important consideration when using any pesticide (the term pesticide is generic and includes herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, etc.) is to read the label first! Although this may seem obvious, it is still of primary importance.
 Pesticide use in this country is in fact regulated by label language, thus it is a violation of state and federal law to use a pesticide product contrary to label directions.
 Specific statements on pesticide labels give precautions to be followed.
 For example, all pesticides not designed for aquatic use will carry the statement:
 "Do not apply directly to water or to areas below the high tide mark." Pesticides toxic to fish may require a setback from fish-bearing waters, and will include statements that the product is highly toxic to fish.
 Pesticides that are highly toxic and/or environmentally damaging will be classified as Restricted Use Pesticides, meaning that one needs to be state certified in order to purchase and use these products.
 In Connecticut all aquatic use of pesticides requires a site-specific permit, issued by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
 All pesticide labels have a signal word on them.
 The signal word is an indicator of the potential human toxicity of the product.
 The three signal words, in order from highest to lowest toxicity, are:
 Danger, Warning and Caution.
 The areas of toxicity to which the signal word applies are acute (single dose) oral, dermal, and inhalation toxicity; also skin irritation and eye irritation.
 The label will explain the area of toxicity to which the signal word pertains, although it sometimes takes careful reading to understand.
 The signal word applies to the material in the container, not diluted product.
 When concentrates are diluted (usually with water) the toxicity will decrease proportionately.
 Dilution with oil may make the chemical more easily absorbed through the skin, thus any reduction in toxicity may not be in proportion to the dilution.
 The herbicides most commonly used for control of invasive plants are glyphosate (active ingredient in Roundup, Accord, and Rodeo), and triclopyr (active ingredient in Ortho Brush-B-Gon, Garlon, and Crossbow, which is triclopyr combined with 2,4-D).
 Glyphosate and triclopyr have different chemical properties and represent different hazards.
 Again, the specific protective clothing to be worn, and health hazards of the product will be noted on the product label.
 Because formulations change, as do the types of protective clothing available, no attempt to specify such will be made here.
 Glyphosate has low oral toxicity (acute or chronic) to humans or other animals.
 Some formulations are irritating to skin or eyes, so precautions to avoid contact should be followed.
 Glyphosate does not persist or bioaccumulate in the environment.
 The most significant environmental impact resulting from glyphosate use is modification of habitat due to vegetation killed (of course, this is the effect desired when attempting to control invasive plants).
 The oral toxicity of triclopyr is fairly low relative to other pesticides, but not as low as that of glyphosate.
 Take precautions to avoid exposure.
 Amine-based triclopyr formulations are corrosive and damaging to eyes and skin, thus they must be handled with a great deal of care.
 Follow the label directions for protective eyewear and clothing.
 Toxicity to birds and fish is relatively low, although ester formulations are more toxic to fish than amine formulations or the parent acid of triclopyr.
 To optimize herbicidal efficacy, and to avoid injury to yourself, non-target plants and the environment� environment�
 ALWAYS READ AND FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ON THE PRODUCT LABEL! LABEL!
 All herbicides mentioned in this guide are classified as "General Use" products.
 "Homeowner" products can be purchased over the counter in garden centers, whereas products packaged in larger containers or in more concentrated forms may only be available at agricultural chemical dealerships.
 In order to purchase or use a "Restricted Use" pesticide, one must obtain certification as a Commercial Pesticide Applicator, which requires passing an exam administered by Connecticut DEP.
 Also, DEP approval must be obtained prior to application of any pesticide to a body of water.
 For control of perennial invasive plants (especially trees, shrubs and woody vines):
 Cutting, mowing or using a contact (non-systemic) herbicide will usually not kill well-established (deep-rooted) plants.
 Regrowth will occur from stumps, underground rootstocks or creeping underground stems (rhizomes).
 Cutting alone often results in a greater number of sprouts or excessive branching.
 Non-chemical control of well-established, deep-rooted plants will require either digging up the entire root system or repeatedly cutting the top growth over several years.
 Use of a systemic herbicide is often necessary to achieve adequate control of such troublesome invasive plants.
 Systemic herbicides absorb into the plant foliage and/or stems, then translocate (move) and accumulate to toxic levels in the growing points or roots.
 Following foliar applications in late summer or fall (prior to leaf color change), systemic herbicides will accumulate in storage tissues below ground.
 In this way, the herbicide is more likely to prevent regrowth the following year.
 Herbicides may be applied by the following methods to control invasive plants:
 1.
 Postemergence (Foliar) Applications - -
 a.
 Spray properly diluted herbicide (in water) onto plant foliage.
 b.
 Wipe herbicide (more concentrated form) onto leaves with wiper applicator.
 2.
 Cut Stump Treatments - Paint concentrated form of herbicide on freshly cut stumps of woody plants.
 3.
 Basal Bark Treatments � Herbicide mixed into oil or diesel fuel carrier to penetrate through bark.
 Often used for dormant season treatments.
 Application equipment � hand-held sprayers, backpack sprayers, paint brush or sprayer for stump and bark treatments treatments
 Addition of a non-ionic surfactant [@ 0.5 fluid ounce (1 tablespoon) per gallon of spray] will improve coverage of spray droplets on treated leaves and enhance absorption of the herbicide into the plant.
 Surfactants (sold under many trade names) can be purchased at fertilizer and pesticide dealerships.
 Some herbicide formulations already contain a surfactant � check the product label carefully.
 Herbicides commonly used for invasive plant control:
 IDENTIFICATION IDENTIFICATION
 Adults are olive-green beetles with black, longitudinal stripes along the margin and center of the back.
 Females lay their yellowish to gray eggs in double rows of about 5 to 25 on the underside of leaves.
 Larvae are black when newly hatched.
 After feeding, they become a dull yellow or green with rows of tiny dark tubercles (projections).
 Larvae develop through three stages called instars.
 Third-instar larvae have dense rows of dark tubercles that resemble two black stripes down their sides, making them easy to distinguish from first- and second-instar larvae.
 Mature third instars are up to 1/3 inch long.
 Pupae are orange to bright yellow.
 LIFE CYCLE CYCLE
 Adults commonly overwinter in bark crevices, litter, woodpiles, or in buildings.
 They fly to foliage in spring, and feed and lay yellowish eggs, which become grayish before hatching.
 After feeding in the canopy for several weeks, mature larvae crawl down the tree trunk, become curled, inactive prepupae, and then develop into yellowish pupae.
 After about 10 days, adult beetles emerge from pupae around the tree base and fly to the canopy to feed and (during spring and summer) lay eggs.
 Elm leaf beetle has at least one generation a year in northern California and two to three generations in central and southern California.
 DAMAGE DAMAGE
 Elm leaf beetle is a serious defoliator of elms.
 Larvae skeletonize the leaf surface, while adults chew entirely through the leaf, often in a shothole pattern.
 Defoliation eliminates summer shade, reduces the aesthetic value of trees, and causes annoying leaf drop.
 Repeated, extensive defoliation weakens elms, causing trees to decline.
 MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT
 Manage elm leaf beetle with an integrated program that incorporates good cultural practices, conservation of natural enemies, regular monitoring, the use of less-toxic insecticides, bark banding with insecticides, or systemic insecticides.
 Recognize that elm leaf beetle populations fluctuate dramatically from year-to-year and most trees do not require treatment every year.
 When beetles are present, otherwise healthy elms can tolerate substantial defoliation.
 Where elm leaf beetle is a problem, use a combination of methods because no single method kills 100% of the pests.
 Relying solely on the same technique year-after-year selects for pest populations less susceptible to that treatment.
 Because adult beetles fly from tree to tree, management efforts directed at single trees may give less satisfactory results in comparison with control efforts aimed at all elms in an area.
 Because elms are large trees, any pesticide spraying is best done by a professional applicator.
 Cultural Control Control
 Good cultural care of trees is an essential component of integrated pest management.
 European and American elm species are adapted to summer rainfall; they require proper irrigation to grow well in California.
 Protect trunks and roots from injury.
 Check for dead or dying branches and properly prune these out during late fall and winter.
 Avoid pruning elms during spring and summer; fresh pruning wounds attract feeding during these seasons by the European elm bark beetle (Scolytus multistriatus), which vectors Dutch elm disease (Ophiostoma [=Ceratocystis] ulmi and O.
 novo-ulmi).
 English elm (Ulmus procera) and Scotch elm (U.
 glabra) are especially susceptible to both elm leaf beetle and Dutch elm disease (Table 1).
 Do not plant these species and consider replacing them in areas where they are growing.
 1 Generally susceptible to elm leaf beetle, but certain selections exhibit some resistance.
 2 American elm selections resistant to Dutch elm disease have exhibited poor growth structure when grown in California.
 3 Reported susceptibility to elm leaf beetle ranges from susceptible to resistant, possibly due to location, genetic variability among plants, or misidentification of elms.
 4 �Dynasty� Chinese elm is highly susceptible to elm leaf beetle.
 Treatment Thresholds Thresholds
 Using treatment thresholds to determine if control is needed helps minimize unnecessary insecticide applications, avoids or reduces annoyance from beetle damage, and protects elms, especially when trees are already stressed or unhealthy from other causes.
 Healthy elm trees can tolerate substantial damage to leaves; even total defoliation may have little long-term effect on healthy elms, especially if leaf damage comes late in the season.
 Suggested treatment thresholds are 40% defoliation (portion of leaf area chewed or leaves dropped prematurely) or 20% defoliation if damage is less tolerable.
 Monitoring Monitoring
 When using insecticide bark bands, foliar sprays, or trunk injection of a systemic insecticide, monitor elm trees to determine the need for treatments and when to apply them.
 Evaluate beetle populations during spring by inspecting foliage weekly for beetles starting in April.
 Watch for the appearance of yellowish eggs, which darken before hatching.
 If trunk injections of systemic insecticides (e.g., abamectin or imidacloprid) are the planned control method for a large number of trees, consider using egg presence-absence sampling and injecting the trees as soon as monitoring indicates thresholds will be exceeded.
 If a foliar insecticide application is planned, spray when early instar (small) larvae are abundant.
 Band bark with an insecticide before mature larvae crawl down trunks to pupate, which in California may occur from early May to late June, depending on the location and weather.
 Inspect foliage weekly during May and June and band as soon as mature larvae are observed on leaves.
 The calendar date of peak abundance of beetles and their damage and the optimal time for banding varies greatly from year-to-year, depending on spring temperatures.
 Monitoring temperature is highly recommended to more accurately time foliage inspection and control actions.
 If an application of a soil systemic insecticide is planned, the optimal treatment time is before beetles are present and before knowing if beetles will be abundant enough to warrant control during the current or next generation of insects.
 Use several criteria to help decide if a preventive, soil-applied insecticide is warranted (Table 2).
 For example, inspect elms during late summer to early fall; if beetles and damage are low, especially on untreated elms, it is less likely that insecticide application will be needed the next season.
 Table 2.
 Criteria to Help Decide if Preventive Systemic Insecticide Is Warranted for Elm Leaf Beetle Control.
 Criteria Avoid treatment Treatment may be warranted warranted
 beetle populations and damage the previous late summer/early fall low population or damage high population or damage damage
 treated the previous season yes no no
 overwintering weather wetter or warmer than average, or both drier or colder than average, or both both
 Although it has not been scientifically demonstrated, relatively warm and wet winters are believed to reduce the likelihood that beetles will be a problem the following spring.
 Wet winters can increase overwintering mortality of beetles from insect pathogenic fungi.
 Warm winters may cause many "hibernating" beetles to starve to death because warmer weather increases the rate at which these insects consume their stored energy (e.g., body fat), increasing the likelihood that beetles will become weakened or starve before elm leaves appear in spring.
 If elm leaf beetle damage was low the previous fall and the winter is warm and wet, avoid preventive insecticide application the following spring.
 Degree-Day Monitoring.
 Insect activity and growth rate depend on temperature.
 Generally, the higher the temperature, the more rapid the development.
 Measuring heat over time provides a physiological time scale called degree-days that is more useful than calendar days for timing insect monitoring and control.
 One degree-day is defined as one degree above the threshold temperature maintained for a full day.
 The lower threshold for elm leaf beetle is 51.8�F (11�C).
 When temperatures are cooler, this pest does not feed, grow, or reproduce.
 To predict the peak abundance of each life stage, degree-days above 51.8�F are accumulated for elm leaf beetle each season beginning March 1 (Table 3).
 If populations are high and damage is anticipated, treatment options include injecting elms as soon as the need for treatment is predicted (based on monitoring egg abundance) or applying a trunk spray or foliar spray at about 700 degree-days (Table 4).

 Temperatures for many locations and relatively easy to use degree-day calculation tools are available from the UC Statewide IPM Project's Web site.
 Alternatively, dedicated devices can record temperatures and calculate degree-days.
 If temperature records are available, a programmable calculator, desktop computer, or printed charts for certain pests can also be used to calculate degree-days.
 Presence-Absence Sampling for Professionals.
 The percentage of 1-foot branch terminals infested with elm leaf beetle eggs can be used to determine treatment need when a large group of trees is being monitored.
 Using a threshold of 40% defoliation, treatment is warranted when over 45% of branch terminals have beetle eggs during the week when egg density is at its maximum during the first generation.
 If the preferred threshold is 20% defoliation, treatment is warranted when over 30% of branch terminals are egg-infested during the first generation.
 If monitoring second-generation eggs, the suggested treatment threshold is about 30% of terminals infested.
 Use a pole pruner to clip two or more 1-foot terminals (samples) from each of eight locations in the lower canopy of each sample tree.
 The clippings should be taken from north, east, south, and west, in both the inner canopy (from trunk halfway to the drip line) and the outer canopy.
 Randomly select the trees to be sampled and sample those trees each week.
 Examine the leaves on each sample and record whether eggs are present or absent.
 Once you observe the first eggs on a sample, there is no need to examine it further; record it as infested and move on to inspect the next terminal.
 To determine the percentage of samples (terminals) infested, divide the number of samples infested by the total number of samples inspected and multiply by 100.
 For more details on presence-absence egg sampling consult the publications by Dahlsten and others or Pests of Landscape Trees and Shrubs listed in References.
 Biological Control Control
 Several introduced and native natural enemies kill elm leaf beetles, but generally do not provide adequate control by themselves.
 The most important parasite in California is a small, black tachinid fly (Erynniopsis antennata) that emerges from mature beetle larvae.
 Its black to reddish, cylinder- or teardrop-shaped pupae occur during spring and summer at the base of trees among the yellowish beetle pupae.
 Erynniopsis antennata overwinters in adult beetles, emerging as adults in spring, although this is not readily observed.
 Unfortunately, the effectiveness of E.
 antennata is limited by Baryscapus (=Tetrastichus) erynniae, a secondary parasite (hyperparasitoid) that kills the beneficial parasite.
 Two tiny wasps also parasitize elm leaf beetle.
 Oomyzus (=Tetrastichus) brevistigma parasitizes mature larvae and pupae; one or more small, round holes in beetle pupae may indicate that this parasite has emerged.
 An egg parasite, Oomyzus (=Tetrastichus) gallerucae, leaves round holes when it emerges from beetle eggs, which remain golden.
 When beetle larvae have emerged, the eggshell is whitish with more ragged holes.
 For illustrations and photographs of elm leaf beetle parasites, consult Natural Enemies Handbook listed in References.
 Conserve these parasites and general predators by avoiding foliar applications of broad-spectrum insecticides; use less toxic materials or apply insecticide as bark bands in an integrated program to obtain maximum benefits from biological control.
 Chemical Control Control
 Methods for chemical control of elm leaf beetle include bark banding, soil applications, tree injection, or foliar spraying in spring after monitoring beetle abundance to determine treatment need.
 Avoid treatment unless necessary.
 Insecticides can have unintended effects, such as contaminating water or killing natural enemies and causing secondary pest outbreaks.
 Bark Banding.
 Bark banding is an inexpensive and environmentally sound technique that involves spraying a small area of the tree trunk with an insecticide.
 Use a hand-pump sprayer or hydraulic sprayer at low pressure to spray a band of bark several feet wide around the first main branch crotch.
 Carbaryl (Sevin) is most commonly used and should be applied at the rate labeled for elm bark beetles (about 2% active ingredient).
 If trunk spraying is not listed on the label of the products available for home landscape use, it will be necessary to have the trunk application done by a licensed pesticide applicator.
 Do not use the rate labeled for foliar applications because this rate will not be effective as a trunk banding treatment.
 Pyrethroids (e.g., fluvalinate) also provide control.
 About one-half gallon of dilute material is applied on each large tree.
 The insecticide kills the larvae when they crawl down to pupate around the tree base after feeding in the canopy.
 By reducing the number of elm leaf beetles that pupate and emerge as adults, bark banding reduces damage by later beetle generations, especially when done to all nearby elms.
 You can determine the best time to spray the trunk by inspecting the foliage and spraying when mature larvae are first observed, or for more accurate timing, by accumulating degree-days and spraying the trunk band when about 700 degree-days (above 51.8�F) have accumulated from March 1.
 A single application of carbaryl to the bark each spring can kill most larvae that crawl over it all season long.
 A second application may be necessary if substantial rain occurs after application, if trunks are frequently wetted by sprinklers, or if a less persistent material is used.
 To determine if the bark band is still effective, regularly inspect around the base of trees throughout the season.
 If many beetles have changed from greenish prepupae (the stage killed by banding) to bright yellowish pupae (unaffected beetles), another application may be warranted.
 Degree-day calculator Degree-day table table
 Bark banding alone will not provide satisfactory control in all situations, especially if only one or a few trees are treated.
 Adult beetles can fly between treated and untreated trees, so bark banding is most effective when done on all the elm trees in a neighborhood.
 Also, overwintered adults fly to the tree canopy and lay eggs, so trunk banding does not reduce the first generation of beetles and their damage.
 A study of elm trees in northern California found good control during the first season of bark banding on Siberian elms (Ulmus pumila), but not on English elm and Scotch elm.
 If beetles are abundant during the first generation, little or no control should be expected the first year when banding more susceptible species such as English and Scotch elms; banding all nearby elms for several consecutive years can provide control after the first year of treatment.
 Systemic Insecticides.
 Elm leaf beetle feeding can be controlled with certain systemic insecticides, including abamectin (Avid, Vivid II), acephate (Orthene), and imidacloprid (Bayer Advanced Tree & Shrub Insect Control, Imicide, Merit).
 Some formulations of these materials can be sprayed onto the tree foliage, but soil applications and tree injections (if labeled for this method of application) minimize environmental contamination and may be more effective than foliar sprays.
 When using systemic insecticides, consider using a soil application whenever possible instead of spraying foliage or injecting or implanting trees.
 Injecting or implanting trunks or roots injures trees, and it is difficult to repeatedly place insecticide at the proper depth.
 Especially avoid methods that cause large wounds, such as implants placed in holes drilled in trunks.
 Do not implant or inject roots or trunks more than once a year.
 Avoid methods that use the same device (such as drills or needles) to contact internal parts of more than one tree.
 Contaminated tools spread elm tree pathogens, including bacteria (such as slime flux or wetwood) and fungi (Dutch elm disease).
 Before moving to work on each new tree, consider cleaning and disinfecting tools to reduce the chance of spreading pathogens when injecting or implanting multiple elms.
 Before chemical disinfection, remove all plant material and scrub any plant sap from tools or equipment that penetrate trees.
 Bleach (and, to a lesser extent, certain other materials) can be effective disinfectants if applied to debris-free tools.
 At least 1 to 2 minutes of disinfectant contact time between contaminated uses is generally required.
 Consider rotating work among several tools, using a freshly disinfected tool while the most recently used tools are being soaked in disinfectant.
 Imidacloprid is available to both home gardeners and professionals for application on or into soil beneath trees.
 The most effective time to apply it is early spring, just before new leaves emerge.
 Make an application before a rainfall, or follow the application with irrigation.
 Although efficacy is delayed until sometime after application, it usually is not necessary to treat 2 years in a row using this method.
 A major disadvantage of this timing is that treatment is made before beetles appear in spring, and before knowing whether insects and damage will be abundant enough to warrant control action.
 Consult the suggested criteria for help in deciding whether preventive treatment is warranted (Table 2).
 Soil applications are possible even if trees are surrounded by pavement.
 Depending on the product label directions, the insecticide can be applied to soil immediately adjacent to the trunk or nearby bare soil, lawn, or planting beds where most absorbing tree roots usually occur.
 Foliar Sprays.
 Several foliar insecticide sprays are available for elm leaf beetle.
 Foliar spraying may be appropriate to supplement banding during the first year or two of treatment or when early-season beetle populations are high.
 The low-toxicity insecticide azadirachtin (Ornazin or Azatin) is a good choice in an integrated pest management program.
 More persistent, broad-spectrum materials, including carbaryl and pyrethroids, are also available for foliar application, but are generally not recommended because of their negative impact on natural enemies and their potential for environmental impacts in urban settings.
 Carefully time all foliar applications to target first- and second-instar larvae.
 Because specialized equipment is required to spray the tops of large elm trees, it is best to hire a professional applicator.
 Bacillus thuringiensis ssp.
 tenebrionis (Btt) kills young beetle larvae and is the only truly selective insecticide.
 Unfortunately, no Btt products are currently (2004) available in California, although Btt (Novodor) is EPA registered for use in most states.
 Btt can be combined with narrow-range oil to kill beetle eggs and other elm pests such as scales.
 Btt is not toxic to people and most nontarget organisms, including natural enemies of the elm leaf beetle.
 Bt subspecies labeled for moth and butterfly caterpillars or mosquito larvae are not effective against elm leaf beetle.

 A continuous cut or girdle around the tree must be made before spray treatment.
 Treat stumps within 6 hours of cutting.
 Foliar spraying is a popular application method of treating brush up to 15 feet tall.
 Foliar application of herbicides entails spraying the leaves of target plants during the growing season with a low concentration of herbicide in a water carrier.
 The spray can be applied with a hand-powered, backpack sprayer or larger, motorized sprayers.
 Research shows that certain herbicides applied to the foliage throughout the growing season consistently provide effective control, while others when applied early in the season, provide only acceptable control.
 Foliar treatments are least effective during periods of drought stress.
 Because the herbicide can take many months to travel from the leaves to the roots, it is important to wait at least a year before cutting the stems of woody vegetation treated with foliar spray.

A biofertilizer (also bio-fertilizer) is a substance which contains living microorganisms which, when applied to seed, plant surfaces, or soil, colonizes the rhizosphere or the interior of the plant and promotes growth by increasing the supply or availability of primary nutrients to the host plant.
An organic compound is any member of a large class of gaseous, liquid, or solid chemical compounds whose molecules contain carbon. For historical reasons discussed below, a few types of carbon-containing compounds such as carbides, carbonates, simple oxides of carbon (such as CO and CO2), and cyanides are considered inorganic.
 The distinction between "organic" and "inorganic" carbon compounds, while "useful in organizing the vast subject of chemistry is somewhat arbitrary". 
Organic chemistry is the science concerned with all aspects of organic compounds. 
Organic synthesis is the methodology of their preparation.
Volatile organic compounds are chemicals used to manufacture and maintain building materials, interior furnishing, cleaning products and personal care products. "Volatile" means that these chemicals evaporate or can easily get into the air at room temperature. 
"Organic" means these chemicals are carbon based. The term "chemical emissions" refers to VOCs as they evaporate into the air from products.
An inorganic compound is a chemical compound that is not an organic compound. Inorganic compounds come principally from mineral sources of non-biological origin. 
The modern definition of inorganic compounds often includes all metal-containing compounds, even those found in living systems. 
Although most carbon compounds are classed as organic, cyanide salts, carbon oxides and carbonates are usually considered to be inorganic. 
A xenobiotic is a chemical which is found in an organism but which is not normally produced or expected to be present in it. 
It can also cover substances which are present in much higher concentrations than are usual. Specifically, drugs such as antibiotics are xenobiotics in humans because the human body does not produce them itself, nor are they part of a normal diet. 
Natural compounds can also become xenobiotics if they are taken up by another organism, such as the uptake of natural human hormones by fish found downstream of sewage treatment plant outfalls, or the chemical defenses produced by some organisms as protection against predators.
Xenobiotics are any chemical compounds that are found in a living organism, but which are foreign to that organism, in the sense that it does not normally produce the compound or consume it as part of its diet. 
For example, in humans, most drugs are part of this category, since people don't produce them naturally, or consume them under normal circumstances. 
Xenobiotics can also be defined as substances that are present in higher-than-normal concentrations, or ones that are entirely artificial and did not exist before they were produced synthetically by humans.
Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. 
Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as in some wines. 
With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the 20th century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin.
Food additives are chemicals added to foods to keep them fresh or to enhance their colour, flavour or texture. 
They may include food colourings , flavour enhancers  or a range of preservatives. 
Additives are ingredients used in the preparation of processed foods. 
Some of these are extracted from naturally occurring materials, others are manufactured by the chemical industry. 
But like every other component of food, all additives are chemicals. 
Preservatives, colours and flavours are the best known additives but antioxidants, emulsifiers, stabilisers, gelling agents, thickeners and sweeteners are also commonly used. 
A catalyst is a substance added to chemicals to speeds up a chemical reaction,
The most important additives are preservatives, without which food would quickly go bad.
We supply base metal and precious metal catalysts for chemical processes. 
These include catalysts for chemical intermediate, petrochemical, edible oil, oleochemical, pharmaceutical, fine chemical and neutraceutical markets
catalytic reactions are typical chemical reactions. The reaction rate depends on the frequency of contact of the reactants in the rate-determining step. 
Usually, the catalyst participates in this slowest step, and rates are limited by amount of catalyst and its "activity". 
In heterogeneous catalysis, the diffusion of reagents to the surface and diffusion of products from the surface can be rate determining.
organic compounds are chemicals used to manufacture and maintain building materials.  
A nanomaterial-based catalyst is an example of a heterogeneous catalyst. 
Analogous events associated with substrate binding and product dissociation apply to homogeneous catalysts.
A drug is a substance which may have medicinal, intoxicating, performance enhancing or other effects when taken or put into a human body or the body of another animal and is not considered a food or exclusively a food. 
What is considered a drug rather than a food varies between cultures, and distinctions between drugs and foods and between kinds of drug are enshrined in laws which vary between jurisdictions and aim to restrict or prevent drug use. 
Even within a jurisdiction, however, the status of a substance may be uncertain or contested with respect to both whether it is a drug and how it should be classified if at all. 
There is no single, precise definition, as there are different meanings in drug control law, government regulations, medicine, and colloquial usage. 
In pharmacology, a drug is a chemical substance used in the treatment, cure, prevention, or diagnosis of disease or used to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being. 
Drugs may be prescribed for a limited duration, or on a regular basis fo disorders.

The D branch of the MeSH vocabulary tree is for Chemicals and Drugs. Frequently, chemicals that are not currently MeSH headings need to be used for indexing. 
To enhance coverage of chemicals, Supplementary Concept Records (SCR) are available.

A chelating agent is a substance whose molecules can form several coordinate bonds to a single metal ion. 
That is, a chelating agent is a polydentate ligand. 
Chelating agents are chemical compounds (usually organic compounds) that form complexes with metal ions or other substrates. 
The most common and most widely used chelating agents are those that coordinate to metal ions through oxygen or nitrogen donor atoms, or through both. 
Chelating agents that coordinate through sulfur in the form of -SH (thiol or mercapto) groups are not as common in commercial applications, but they perform a significant role in complexing metal ions in biological systems. 
Three widely used chelating agents are ethylenediamine, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and dimercaprol.
Atoms in a chemical element are called isotopes. The atoms in a particular element have an identical number of protons and electrons but can have varying numbers of neutrons.
An isotope is a form of a chemical element whose atomic nucleus contains a specific number of neutron s, in addition to the number of proton s that uniquely defines the element.
Acid rain is caused by a chemical reaction that begins when compounds like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are released into the air. 
A pesticide is generally a chemical or biological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial or disinfectant) that through its effect deters, incapacitates, kills or otherwise discourages pests.
Balanced fertilization (BF) is one of the keys for improving fertilizers.
Balanced fertilization is the key to efficient fertilizer utilization and for sus- tainable high yields use efficiency.
Acceptable daily intake or ADI is a measure of the amount of a specific substance (originally applied for a food additive, later also for a residue of a veterinary drug or pesticide) in food or drinking water that can be ingested (orally) on a daily basis over a lifetime without an appreciable health risk.[1] 
ADIs are expressed usually in milligrams (of the substance) per kilograms of body weight per day.[2][3]
This concept was first introduced in 1961 by the Council of Europe and later, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), a committee maintained by two United Nations bodies: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO).[2]
Concept
An ADI value is based on current research, with long-term studies on animals and observations of humans. 
First, a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL),[3][4] the amount of a substance that shows no toxic effects, is determined. 
Usually the studies are performed with several doses including high doses. 
In the case of several studies on different effects, the lowest NOAEL is usually taken. 
Then, the NOAEL (or another point of departure such as a benchmark dose level (BMDL)) is divided by a safety factor, conventionally 100, to account for the differences between test animals and humans (factor of 10) and possible differences in sensitivity between humans (another factor of 10).[3]
 safety factors with values other than 100 may be used if information on uncertainty about the value of the point of departure (NOAEL or BMDL) justify it. 
For instance, if the ADI is based on data from humans the safety factor is usually 10 instead of 100. The ADI is usually given in mg per kg body weight.[5]
The ADI is considered a safe intake level for a healthy adult of normal weight who consumes an average daily amount of the substance in question. 
Increased safety factors for infants have been discussed, but are not needed, because elimination of chemicals is in fact often more rapid in children and as children generally suffer higher illness rates than adults, adverse effects caused by food additives can easily be disguised as any number of things children usually suffer with. 
It would be far more difficult to argue the case with a healthy adult.[6]
 The ADI does not take into account allergic reactions that are individual responses rather than dose-dependent phenomena.
The higher the ADI, the larger amounts of a compound are safe for regular ingestion. 
The concept of tolerable daily intake is often used for unwanted contaminants or other chemicals.
The ADI concept can be understood as a measure to indicate the toxicity from long-term exposure to repeated ingestion of chemical compounds in foods (present and/or added), as opposed to acute toxicity.
